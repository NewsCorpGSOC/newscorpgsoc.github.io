Trump announces first meeting with Putin to take place in Saudi Arabia	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 12 that his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will take place in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;ll meet in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House, according to AFP. His statement came just hours after he revealed that the two leaders had spoken by telephone and agreed to immediately begin peace talks regarding Ukraine. The announcement marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow. The decision to hold negotiations without Ukraine&apos;s direct involvement has raised concerns about Kyiv&#x2019;s role in shaping its own future. The extent of Ukrainian participation in the talks remains unclear. Trump&#x2019;s approach signals a renewed push to broker a resolution to the ongoing war, however, neither the Kremlin nor the White House has provided further details on the timing or agenda of the meeting. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that both he and Vladimir Putin agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes, during which Putin extended an invitation for Trump to visit Moscow. Trump also announced that he had instructed a team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead the negotiations. According to Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 14 to begin official peace negotiations. &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote on Truth Social.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-first-meeting-with-putin-to-take-place-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-12T13:09:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trumps holds talks with Zelensky and Putin, says negotiations to end war in Ukraine to start 'immediately'	Key developments on. Feb. 12: U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. &quot;Just spoke with Donald Trump. Long conversation. About the possibilities of achieving peace. About our willingness to work together. About our technological capabilities, including drones and other modern manufacturing,&quot; Zelensky said following the call. &quot;Ukraine wants peace more than anyone else. We are defining our joint steps with America to stop Russian aggression and guarantee a reliable, lasting peace,&quot; he added. Hours prior, Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; In a post on Truth Social, Trump said both agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes and Putin invited Trump to Moscow. Trump added that he had instructed a team including State Secretary Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to lead the negotiations. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio will meet Zelensky on Feb. 14 to begin official peace negotiations, Trump announced on Truth Social. &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;I am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. It is time to stop this ridiculous war, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, death and destruction,&quot; he added. &quot;God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that it is unrealistic to expect that Ukraine can restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. also wants to see Ukraine as &quot;sovereign and prosperous,&quot; but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&quot; &quot;Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,&quot; he added. Hegseth also said the U.S. does not believe that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. The Pentagon chief added that any security guarantees provided to Ukraine must also be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops.&quot; &quot;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier in the day to participate in the Ramstein-format meeting. As Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office, the U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has begun his work at the 26th Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12, the first event of its kind not chaired by the U.S. The meeting, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. &quot;The main goal is strengthening military cooperation and real mechanisms to support Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. The agenda includes ensuring a stable and timely supply of military aid in 2025, accelerating the delivery of critical weapons like air defense systems, aviation, and ammunition, and fostering joint projects with European partners. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. This marks the first Ramstein summit during U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has prompted concerns not only about the future of the UDCG but also about the overall allied support for Ukraine. While pledging to broker a swift peace deal, the U.S. president has been evasive regarding the continued military backing for Kyiv. &quot;This is an important stage in strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and coordinating further actions of the allies,&quot; Umerov added. The UDCG, comprising over 50 countries, including all NATO members, typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Ramstein summit coincides with other key events this week, including the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting and the Munich Security Conference. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that without Ukraine, Europe could face a full-scale Russian occupation due to Moscow&apos;s numerical advantage in forces, he said in a segment of an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 12. Zelensky highlighted the disparity in forces between Russia and Europe, saying that Ukraine&apos;s army consists of 110 brigades, while Russia fields 220 and plans to expand to 250 this year. In contrast, Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades, he said. &quot;Without Ukraine, Europe will be totally occupied by Russia, if they want. And I believe they (Russia) have nothing else on their mind,&quot; the president said in the interview. &quot;Today, an army of 110 brigades is holding back those who have 220-230. But it&apos;s one to two,&quot; Zelensky added. The president said that while Russia&apos;s numeral advantage compared to Ukraine is two to one, in comparison to Europe, it&apos;s three to one, which is sufficient for an effective offensive. Zelensky added that Russia intends to increase its forces by 12-15 divisions &#x2014; around 150,000 troops &#x2014; through mobilization, training, and the addition of North Korean soldiers. According to the president, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence also suggests that new Russian recruits will be trained in Belarus. &quot;After that, they can launch a full-scale invasion from there. But who said that it would be to Ukraine? Russia can invade Poland or Lithuania,&quot; Zelensky warned. The president said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Zelensky also disclosed in the interview that an assassination attempt on him at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 led to casualties inside the Presidential Office. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the head of the agency&apos;s counter-terrorism department, who is suspected of working for Russian intelligence, SBU head Vasyl Maliuk announced on Feb. 12. While the agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s name, the Kyiv Independent&apos;s SBU sources identified him as Colonel Dmytro Koziura. The suspect&apos;s illicit activities were documented in 14 separate cases, according to Maliuk. The SBU chief emphasized that the operation to uncover and detain him required &quot;all possible overt and covert methods.&quot; The case sheds light on Russian efforts to infiltrate and undermine Ukraine&apos;s security services amid the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. &quot;In the process, we managed to document the collection and transmission of relevant information to Russia,&quot; Maliuk added. The suspect was said to be working with Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB). &quot;Using encrypted software bookmarks, we penetrated the traitor&apos;s gadgets &#x2014; mobile terminals and computers. We basically lived with him and conducted audio and video monitoring,&quot; the SBU chief added. The SBU head described the operation as part of an ongoing internal purge and warned that no Russian infiltration attempts would succeed. Further details of the case are expected to be released soon. A Russian ballistic missile strike on Kyiv on Feb. 12 damaged the office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim, the news channels announced. The office sustained damage to windows and equipment, but the channels said they remain operational. The statements mentioned no casualties. According to a TSN journalist on the ground, everything within a 300-meter radius was damaged. Parts of the facades were demolished, and doors were blown off. &quot;For terrorists who violate any conventions and disregard international law, the media is a desirable target,&quot; the Freedom TV channel said in a statement. Russia has previously targeted Ukraine&apos;s media infrastructure, including a strike on Kharkiv&apos;s TV broadcasting tower in April 2024 and Kyiv&apos;s TV tower in March 2022. The morning attack on Kyiv struck an industrial zone housing multiple office centers. Footage from the scene shows shattered glass, structural damage to buildings, and wrecked cars. At least one person was killed and four injured in the city. Ukraine War Latest is put together by the Kyiv Independent news desk team, who keep you informed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Zelensky imposes sanctions against ex-President Poroshenko, former president says	Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) has imposed sanctions against ex-President Petro Poroshenko, the former president said in a statement. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that an official decree will be published on Feb. 13, without naming Poroshenko by name. Poroshenko did not specify what restrictions would be imposed on him in his video address, but the sanctions could be implemented based on alleged &quot;high treason,&quot; according to Forbes Ukraine, which cited two sources. &quot;The National Security and Defense Council has just made an unconstitutional, politically motivated decision to impose sanctions against me, Petro Poroshenko, the leader of the opposition and the fifth president (of Ukraine),&quot; Poroshenko said in a statement. &quot;Today, Zelensky has dealt a huge blow to the internal unity that our team has been strictly adhering to since February 2022 and which is our main weapon in the fight against the aggressor,&quot; he said. &quot;All responsibility for the negative consequences lies directly with him,&quot; Poroshenko added. In his evening address, Zelensky said he had participated in the Defense Council meeting and that its decisions would be published the following day.&quot;We are defending our country and restoring justice. Everyone who destroyed the national security of Ukraine and helped Russia must be held accountable (for their actions),&quot; Zelensky said without specifying who exactly could be penalized and what that would mean. Poroshenko served one term as Ukraine&apos;s president from 2014 until 2019. Volodymyr Zelensky dealt a decisive defeat to Poroshenko in the 2019 election, securing 73.22% of the vote against his opponent&apos;s 24.45% in the second round. Following Zelensky&apos;s victory, over 20 criminal cases were opened against Poroshenko. He was charged with treason, his shares in 19 companies were seized, and his affiliated companies received multimillion-dollar fines from the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine, according to Forbes Ukraine. After the start of the full-scale invasion, the investigation of criminal cases against the former president was suspended.	https://kyivindependent.com/forbes-ukraine-ukraines-national-security-and-defense-council-imposes-sanctions-against-ex-president-poroshenko/	2025-02-12T12:38:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258284805.jpg
We asked young Ukrainians what would make them sign up for the armed forces	Ukraine faces a delicate balancing act &#x2014; mobilizing enough people to fend off the immediate threat posed by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, and preserving enough of the country&apos;s youth to weather longer-term demographic concerns. On top of this, U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are reportedly urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address the manpower shortages, a move that President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently resisted. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; for those aged 18-24 appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. The new one-year contracts will include a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education, it was reported on Feb. 10. A day later, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. &quot;We are building a new army recruitment system that meets modern challenges,&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a post on Facebook on Feb. 11 when announcing the special contracts. &quot;We are bringing in motivated warriors, providing them with career growth opportunities, and ensuring fair service conditions.&quot; But according to several young men aged 17-24 in Kyiv who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the enticements may be attractive, but concerns remain. &quot;I support this because it is very important to attract young people to the armed forces,&quot; 19-year-old Vadym Chaplyhin, a student at the Kyiv School of Economics tells the Kyiv Independent. A military officer from the third separate assault brigade does recruitment work in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 15, 2024. (Ashley Chan / SOPA Images / Getty Images)He said the proposed benefits &quot;look pretty good&quot; and the opportunity to go abroad after one year of service &quot;will significantly influence the decision of many boys.&quot; &quot;(It is) a chance to see family and friends and travel the world a bit,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;That is why I like this point very much, and if we consider my doubts about mobilization, this possibility significantly tips the scales in its direction.&quot; But Chaplyhin has reservations about how a contract soldier might be viewed by those who were conscripted. &quot;How will other soldiers treat such mobilized people? After all, they may be perceived as those who have &apos;sold out&apos; and will fight not for ideals, but for money,&quot; he says. Oleksandr Slysh, a 24-year-old master&apos;s degree graduate, expressed deep skepticism that some of the benefits would be honored. After his previous experience working as an assistant military lawyer for six months, he believes offers like the right to travel abroad would only be implemented for &quot;high-ranking officials or their children,&quot; but not for &quot;ordinary soldiers.&quot; Slysh also suggests that no amount of money, free education or any other benefits can compensate for what he might experience if he ends up fighting on the front lines. &quot;Infantry is the hardest job in the armed forces, and most infantrymen are very psychologically traumatized if they survive,&quot; he says. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight, so the prospect of knowing the contract ends after one year is seen as a big plus by 23-year-old accountant Andrii. He and several other people interviewed for this story didn&#x2019;t wish to be fully identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. &quot;I like all the conditions, but the most important thing is that the contract be fulfilled in one year,&quot; he tells the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As they say, one year is enough.&quot; Cadets sing the national anthem of Ukraine during the celebration of the Day of Knowledge at the Lviv State Lyceum in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sept. 1, 2023. (Pavlo Palamarchuk / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)But an 18-year-old studying to be a chef who didn&apos;t wish to be named, says he doesn&apos;t trust the authorities when they say the contract will actually end after one year. &quot;They could say &apos;sign this contract, you will serve for a year.&apos; Then they will make some kind of law that says those who have signed a contract and served for a year are eligible for general mobilization, even if they&apos;re under 25,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m worried about what might happen after the contract is up.&quot; Yevhen, a 24-year old &#xA0;computer science student at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, suggests the special contracts only provide an incentive for less well-off Ukrainians. &quot;I think that it will be relevant for children from low-income families or villages, but in Kyiv I&apos;m not sure how relevant it is,&quot; he says. &quot;Most students in Kyiv live with their parents and have free tuition, and an apartment at this age.&quot; Dmytro, a 24-year-old economics student, echoed this sentiment, saying the decision to sign a special contract &quot;depends very much on whether you have a job.&quot; &quot;If you&apos;re in some kind of civil service role or a good company or you&apos;re sitting in a ministry getting paid, you have much less time to be killed, and you don&apos;t need it,&quot; he says. But for some, no number of enticements will be enough to make them sign up. &quot;My life is more important to me. And since I have no relatives here, nothing motivates me here at all,&quot; Bohdan, a 23-year-old tattoo artist says. Yaroslav, a 17-year-old student, is thinking about his future career, but thinks the army is &quot;not my thing.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d rather be in the civilian world. I&apos;m more interested in something like law or philosophy.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-asked-young-ukrainians-what-would-make-them-sign-up-for-the-armed-forces/	2025-02-12T11:58:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1255487880.jpg
Trump says peace talks to start 'immediately.' But what terms would be acceptable for Ukraine?	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 12 held phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on the same day that it is unrealistic to expect Ukraine to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending the war. He also said that NATO membership for Ukraine is off the table. Following the most recent comments by U.S. top officials, Kyiv would most likely be pressured by Washington to make concessions to Russia. Ukraine will likely refuse to recognize any of the occupied territories as Russian de jure, reduce its army, legalize any openly pro-Russian political project, or officially abandon aspirations to join NATO, experts say. Other clauses may be more palatable for Kyiv. These include a delay in NATO membership, freezing the current front line, holding elections, or exchanging Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk Oblast for some part of Russian-occupied Ukraine. There may also be some compromise on &#x201C;pro-peace parties&#x201D; that do not openly back Russia, the status of the Russian language, and the Russian-backed Orthodox church in case it breaks ties with Russia, according to experts. Yet, for Ukraine, it all comes down to making sure that Russia won&apos;t renew its invasion as soon as it sees an opportunity. &quot;The main question is how to deter Putin if he &#x2014; should a truce agreement be reached, which I doubt &#x2014; tries once again to seize a larger part of Ukraine&apos;s territory,&quot; said Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee. &quot;What could realistically stop him? In my opinion, only NATO membership,&quot; he added. Zelensky and several top U.S. officials, including Trump&apos;s Ukraine and Russia envoy Keith Kellogg and Vice President JD Vance, will attend the Munich Security Conference scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Zelensky is expected to meet both of them, according to the President&apos;s Office. Kellogg is also expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, while Trump said he is expected to meet with Zelensky soon, without providing the exact place and time of the proposed meeting. The potential peace negotiations would be the number one topic on the list. Yet, regardless of what the U.S. officials could ask, there are a number of red lines that Ukraine would not cross. Experts agree that Ukraine will likely not recognize any of the Russian-occupied territories as Russian de jure, while Russia will not cancel the illegal annexation of any of the territories that it claims in Ukraine. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Despite this, Russia only partially controls the latter four regions it said it owns. &quot;There are two fundamental things that must not be compromised,&quot; Volodymyr Aryev, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party, told the Kyiv Independent. President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Viktor Kovalchuk / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)&quot;First, recognizing the aggressor&apos;s claim over the occupied territories is unacceptable. Second, we cannot accept limitations on our army, restrictions on the number of weapons, or any self-imposed constraints on forming military alliances. These two red lines must be set in stone. As for everything else, I think there is room to maneuver to some extent.&quot; A freezing of the front line or an exchange of occupied territories without any change in their legal status is possible, according to experts. &quot;I think there will be a ceasefire along the line of contact at the time,&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There may be some adjustments and possibly a buffer zone. But I cannot see any major territorial changes or any formal recognition of the status quo.&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that Ukraine could exchange its foothold in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast for the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Independent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin agreed, saying that &quot;the Kursk factor is very important here&quot; and that &quot;exiting the war with part of his territory occupied by Ukrainian forces would be humiliating for Putin.&quot; Zelensky has said he&apos;s open to an exchange. The Telegraph reported in November that, under one of the peace plans being considered by Trump, he might call on European peacekeepers to enforce a buffer zone in Ukraine. Experts say this is theoretically possible, but the proposal would face difficulties, and Russia will likely resist. &quot;To carry out military functions, there would have to be tens of thousands of personnel,&quot; Oreshkin said. &quot;The West is unlikely to be enthusiastic about this idea because it would be an extremely expensive undertaking.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that &quot;whether this is feasible or not will probably depend on the precise set of circumstances and restrictions in force.&quot; French soldiers of the NATO combat unit in Estonia stand in front of a combat vehicle in a military hangar in Tapa, Estonia, on Dec. 17, 2024. (Alexander Welscher / Picture alliance via Getty Images)&quot;Putting peacekeeping forces in an area where military operations are still happening or at great risk of taking place would be asking for trouble,&quot; she added. &quot;European governments are likely to be justifiably cautious.&quot; The deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine is possible but definitely not the 200,000 number mentioned by Zelensky in January, Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. In his most recent interview, Zelensky said that European activity on the ground must be backed by the U.S. &quot;There are voices which say that Europe could offer security guarantees without the Americans, and I always say no,&quot; Zelensky told the Guardian. &quot;Security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees.&quot; According to Kellogg&apos;s earlier proposals, the sanctions imposed on Russia would be partially lifted. But the crucial question for Ukraine is whether the lifting of the sanctions will be dependent on Russia&apos;s compliance with a potential ceasefire or peace deal. Wolff said that &quot;if there is a ceasefire, some gradual reduction of sanctions is likely.&quot; &quot;Unless sanction-lifting was done as part of a step-by-step process dependent on Russia taking meaningful steps to undo and make amends for the damage it has done to Ukraine and Ukrainians, Putin would simply pocket it as a win and carry on to do as he wished,&quot; Mathers said. According to a peace plan co-authored by Kellogg in early 2024, Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession would be taken off the table for an extended period. Ukraine has sought to join the alliance since the early 2000s and officially applied for NATO membership in 2022. Ukraine&apos;s intention to join the alliance is included in its constitution. However, the bloc has been reluctant to admit Ukraine. Since NATO is not currently agreeing to Ukraine&apos;s accession anyway, a clause on a delay in NATO membership would not change much, experts say. &quot;NATO has already effectively delayed the question of Ukraine&apos;s membership until some indefinite point in the future,&quot; Mathers said. Keith Kellogg, former national security advisor, speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, on March 4, 2023. (Al Drago / Bloomberg / Getty Images)Aryev said that a decision on whether to delay NATO membership is up to the alliance, not Ukraine, and Kyiv cannot &quot;force its way in.&quot; However, Russia has demanded not just delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession but requiring Kyiv to officially abandon the goal of NATO membership and become a neutral state. Experts and lawmakers say that Ukraine is highly unlikely to accept this demand. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership is a strategic goal, and Ukraine must stand its ground on this matter at all costs,&quot; Aryev said. Merezhko agreed, saying that &quot;under no circumstances should Ukraine abandon its goal of joining NATO, as it is the best guarantee of our security and survival.&quot; Since NATO accession is unlikely in the near future, a lot depends on whether the West will provide any tangible security guarantees for Ukraine. Kellogg&apos;s plan envisages security guarantees for Ukraine but does not elaborate on them. &quot;There could be a security agreement with the U.S.,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;It should be ratified by the U.S. Congress so that it becomes a full-fledged treaty &#x2014; at least something similar to the agreements that (the U.S. had with) Israel and Egypt.&quot; Aryev said that a genuine security guarantee would be a bilateral treaty similar to the &quot;Taiwan Relations Act, which is part of U.S. legislation and obliges the United States to provide military assistance to Taiwan in the event of aggression.&quot; Despite that, even a bilateral defense pact with the U.S. doesn&apos;t guarantee that Ukraine would receive anything more than military aid. JD Vance made it clear, saying on Feb. 11 that the U.S. would not be sending troops to Ukraine and that the heavy lifting should instead be done by Europeans. Instead, Zelensky has said that Kyiv does not see any security agreements as having real weight unless they include U.S. backing.

(Telmo Pinto / SOPA Images / Getty Images)According to Kellogg&apos;s proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg&apos;s proposals stipulate that the U.S. would cease military aid to Ukraine if it does not agree to hold peace negotiations. On the other hand, the U.S. would increase its military support for Ukraine if Russia refuses to accept a peace deal. &quot;(Military aid for Ukraine) depends on whether Putin overplays his hand and Trump gets more frustrated seeing Russia as the main obstacle to a deal,&quot; Wolff said. Kellogg told Reuters in a Feb. 1 interview that the U.S. wants Ukraine to hold elections, potentially by the end of the year, especially if Kyiv can agree to a truce with Russia in the coming months. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned. Elections can only be held after martial law is lifted. Experts say that elections are a realistic scenario if there is a ceasefire, and if martial law is canceled, but not before a ceasefire. Over 7 million Ukrainians have left Ukraine as a result of Russia&apos;s war and are now living abroad. Another 4.5 million are internally displaced. In total, that&apos;s around a third of the country&apos;s entire population. With around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territories occupied by Russia, &quot;millions more&quot; remain in the Russian-occupied territories, according to Zelensky. Furthermore, the infrastructure required for elections to take place has been destroyed in multiple settlements across the country. &quot;These multiple problems simply mean that talks about elections are too early,&quot; said Oleksandr Salizhenko, editor-in-chief of the political watchdog Chesno. At least publicly, the Kremlin has pushed for lifting Ukraine&apos;s ban on pro-Russian parties, which was introduced in 2022 due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Experts and lawmakers say that Ukraine is unlikely to agree to allow parties that openly advocate for Russia and its agenda. &quot;The people will never support such parties,&quot; Merezhko said. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how this could be politically possible, for example, to lift the ban on the (Russian-linked) Opposition Platform-For Life party or the Party of Regions. It&apos;s impossible.&quot; Fesenko said that &quot;allowing them to participate in elections would cause massive resistance.&quot; But if the wording applies to &#x201C;pro-peace parties&#x201D; that do not openly back Russia, a compromise is possible, experts say. The &#x201C;pro-peace&#x201D; label has been extensively used by Russian-linked political projects, framing those who oppose Russia and its war as being &#x201C;pro-war.&#x201D; &quot;What they might do is to formulate it differently &#x2014; that parties participating in elections can represent the interests of various ethnic and linguistic groups,&quot; Fesenko said. The Kremlin has also pushed for lifting restrictions on the Russian-backed Orthodox church in Ukraine. In August 2024, Ukraine passed a law to ban religious organizations affiliated with Russia. Such organizations can break ties with Russia within nine months, and the ban will come into effect if they fail to do so. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet with the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 27, 2013. (kremlin.ru)Experts are divided on whether Ukraine may make concessions to Russia on the status of the Russian-backed Orthodox church. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine this because people will never accept such changes,&quot; Merezhko said. &quot;Everything related to Russia is toxic. The Russian Orthodox Church is a weapon for Russia. Its legalization would be the legalization of a subversive Russian organization.&quot; The Russian Orthodox Church had been directly involved in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, supporting the attacks committed by the Russian Armed Forces. Patriarch Kirill has said Moscow is waging a &#x201C;holy war&#x201D; against Kyiv. However, Fesenko argued that, regarding the Russian-backed church, &quot;it may be possible to find some kind of compromise wording.&quot; He said that the law stipulates &quot;breaking official ties with aggressor countries,&quot; and &quot;a formulation can be found&quot; to address this issue &#x2014; such as the Russian-backed church&apos;s formal independence from Moscow. Russia may also demand an official status for the Russian language. Ukrainian is currently the only official language in Ukraine, but the constitution guarantees the protection of Russian and other minority languages. Under pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine passed a law granting Russian and other languages official minority status in certain regions in 2012. However, the Constitutional Court deemed the law unconstitutional in 2018 and repealed it. Merezhko said that he could not imagine granting Russian official status alongside Ukrainian, while Aryev said he believed the existing constitutional protection of the Russian language was sufficient. Fesenko argued that the status of an official state language for Russian is unlikely but a certain other status for the Russian language can be discussed. One of Russia&apos;s demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine is so-called &quot;demilitarization&quot; &#x2014; a unilateral decrease in the number of Ukrainian army personnel. &quot;Moscow would, of course, be delighted with this outcome and has been pushing for Ukraine to be limited to a military that would be mostly symbolic and totally unable to defend the country from further attacks by Russia,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Without serious security guarantees, however, I cannot see Kyiv agreeing to such a measure.&quot; Male volunteers in military uniform at the conscription point after signing a contract with the Ukrainian army in Unspecified, Ukraine, on March 26, 2024. (Serhii Mykhalchuk / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)Fesenko argued that the only way this would be palatable for Ukraine is to impose similar restrictions on both the Ukrainian and Russian armies. &quot;For economic and demographic reasons, they&apos;ll both have to (reduce the size of the army),&quot; Wolff said. &quot;But I am not sure that either side will accept legally binding upper limits.&quot; Merezhko argued that &quot;Putin can agree only to such ceasefire conditions that would allow him to attempt again, after some time, to capture Kyiv and destroy Ukrainian statehood.&quot; &quot;That is the problem,&quot; he added. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s and Putin&apos;s goals are diametrically opposed, leaving no common ground for negotiations.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/which-clauses-of-potential-peace-deal-would-be-acceptable-for-ukraine-and-realistic/	2025-02-12T11:56:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195733995.jpg
US to release Russian cybercrime boss in exchange for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, Reuters reports	Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cybercrime boss who was serving a prison sentence in the U.S., will be released in exchange for the return of American teacher Marc Fogel, Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing an unnamed U.S. official. Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for agreeing to the deal and called it a step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia&apos;s sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev arranged the exchange, Reuters reported, citing a source close to the negotiations. Vinnik was detained in Greece in 2017 at the request of the U.S., who accused Vinnik of laundering at least $4 billion dollars in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings, and other criminal activity through the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e. Vinnik must forfeit over $100 million to the U.S. government and is currently in northern California awaiting transfer back to Russia. The official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, did not specify when Vinnik was to travel to Russia. Fogel is a 63-year-old schoolteacher who was serving a 14-year sentence after being detained at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana. He was flown out of Russia on Feb. 11 by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy Steve Witkoff. Three people were also released from prison in Belarus on Feb. 12, the Trump administration announced. One American whose name was undisclosed and two others, journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Andrei Kuznechyk and Alena Maushuk, were released by the Belarusian government.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-release-russian-bitcoin-suspect-in-exchange-for-fogel-media-reports/	2025-02-12T11:20:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-997822070.jpg
Restoring Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic objective,' Pentagon chief says	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that it is unrealistic to expect that Ukraine can restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. also wants to see Ukraine as &quot;sovereign and prosperous,&quot; but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&quot; &quot;Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,&quot; he added. Hegseth also said the U.S. does not believe that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. The Pentagon chief added that any security guarantees provided to Ukraine must also be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops.&quot; &quot;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier in the day to participate in the Ramstein-format meeting. As Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office, the U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry.	https://kyivindependent.com/returning-to-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-is-unrealistic-objective-pentagon-chief-says/	2025-02-12T09:55:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196790881.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. Hours prior, Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; In a post on Truth Social, Trump said both agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Volodymyr Zelensky, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.&quot; According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes and Putin invited Trump to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-holds-talks-with-zelensky-following-his-1-5-hour-long-conversation-with-putin/	2025-02-12T09:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771-1.jpg
US Senate confirms Ukraine-skeptic Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence	The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence on Feb. 10. The former lawmaker has previously blamed NATO for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and faced scrutiny for her controversial foreign policy views. As director of national intelligence, Gabbard will be in charge of U.S. spy agencies. Gabbard is a National Guard veteran and former Democratic congress member who left the party in 2022 and began campaigning alongside U.S. President Donald Trump. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never led a government department or agency. She has previously repeated Kremlin talking points justifying the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia&apos;s legitimate security concerns,&quot; she wrote on &#xA0;X at the start of the invasion. Gabbard has also argued that the eastward expansion of NATO had provoked Moscow and claimed that the U.S. was fueling a proxy war with Russia that could lead to a &quot;forever war.&quot; During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Gabbard said she was &quot;offended&quot; by a question from Republican Senator Jerry Moran over whether Russia would &quot;get a pass&quot; from her in light of her past statements. &quot;Because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about our own nation, our own security, and the interests of the American people. No country, group, or individual will get a pass.&quot; When asked who she blamed for the war in Ukraine, Gabbard backtracked on her prior remarks about NATO and U.S. President Joe Biden.&quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war in Ukraine,&quot; she said. Gabbard also dismissed claims that she helped amplify pro-Russian viewpoints. &quot;I don&apos;t pay attention to Russian propaganda,&quot; she said. Senators also grilled Gabbard on her controversial 2017 meeting with former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a visit that sparked outrage from both Republicans and Democrats. The Russian-backed regime was accused of human rights violations, including the use of illegal chemical weapons. &quot;I just do not understand how you can blame NATO for Putin&apos;s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and when Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, you didn&apos;t condemn him,&quot; said Senator Mark Warner, the committee&apos;s senior Democrat. Gabbard defended the meeting with Assad, saying it was an opportunity to ask &quot;tough questions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-senate-confirms-ukraine-skeptic-tulsi-gabbard-as-director-of-national-intelligence/	2025-02-12T09:44:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701925.jpg
Trump confirms call with Putin, says Ukraine peace negotiations to start 'immediately'	Editor&apos;s note: This is a breaking story and will be updated regularly. U.S. President Donald Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately,&quot; he announced on Feb. 12.

US Treasury Secretary meets Zelensky, passes along draft agreement on critical minerals	U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Feb. 12 and passed him a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. minerals agreement, Interfax Ukraine reported. President Donald Trump announced the day prior that Bessent would arrive in Ukraine soon, without disclosing the date of the American official&apos;s visit. &quot;We talked about minerals... I know that our team has been given the first draft of this document on a partnership between our countries,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I really want our team to work on this document. We received this document today. We will do everything so that our teams can quickly agree and sign this document,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump previously suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Ukraine with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Zelensky has said he is open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for continued support from Washington. Bessent is the first representative of the new U.S. administration after Trump&apos;s return to the White House. The Presidential Office also said previously that Ukraine is preparing to host Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-treasury-secretary-meets-zelensky-passes-draft-agreement-on-critical-minerals/	2025-02-12T09:03:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197389153.jpg
Ukraine must 'build NATO on its territory' if not invited to alliance, Zelensky says	Ukraine is not giving up on its NATO aspirations, but if denied an invitation to the alliance, it &quot;must build NATO on its territory&quot; by strengthening the military, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Economist in an interview published on Feb. 12. &quot;We have to double it. Double. To be on the same level as the Russian army,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Zelensky acknowledged in the interview that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is unlikely due to opposition from the U.S., Germany, and Hungary, but believes the latter would change its mind if U.S. President Donald Trump asked. He believes Trump could provide security guarantees to Ukraine without even having to discuss them with Russia and that Europe could help finance Ukraine&apos;s defense, with &quot;missiles, long-distance missiles and Patriot (air-defense systems).&#x201D; When asked whether he had a plan B if all of the above did not work out, Zelensky replied, &quot;This is plan B.&quot; Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-build-nato-on-its-territory-if-it-isnt-invited-into-alliance-zelensky-says/	2025-02-12T09:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump tariffs hit Ukraine's steel industry	The following is the Feb. 11, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine&#x2019;s steel industry &#x2014; one of its most critical sectors &#x2014; just can&#x2019;t seem to catch a break as of late. First a critical mine closes, then comes U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s tariffs on steel. Last week, we published an article on what the loss of the Pokrovsk mine that produces coking coal &#x2014; necessary to make steel &#x2014; would mean for Ukraine. The mine was the last remaining coking coal site in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The country&#x2019;s steel producers will now have to increase imports of the fuel, racking up transport costs, business reporter Dominic Culverwell writes. Importing more coking coal will hinder the global competitiveness of Ukrainian steel, which has already taken a pounding since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Some analysts are unsure if Ukrainian producers can afford to cover the needed imports. &#x201C;To produce the 2024 volume of steel &#x2014; 7.5 million metric tons &#x2014; we would need (to import) 1.9 million tons of coal. We have doubts whether it would be possible to import such quantities and definitely it would further increase the costs of our steel producers,&#x201D; Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association, told the Kyiv Independent. And then came Trump&#x2019;s executive order on Feb. 10 imposing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions. Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook that Ukraine&#x2019;s metallurgical products make up 57.9% of Ukraine&apos;s exports to the U.S., or in dollar amounts, $503 million out of $869 million. It&#x2019;s unclear what time frame those figures represent. True &#x2014; the share of Ukrainian products in U.S. steel products is minimal and won&#x2019;t have a significant impact on U.S. producers. But it&#x2019;s still another blow to the country&#x2019;s largest exports of metallurgical companies &#x2014; ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih and Interpipe &#x2014; already hurting due to the war. &quot;In recent years, we have made every effort to ensure that Ukrainian steel remains outside the 25% tariff limit in the U.S.,&quot; Svyrydenko said, implying that these efforts have been unsuccessful. The minister added that she and her colleagues are &#x201C;working actively with partners to find an optimal solution by March 12,&#x201D; when the tariffs come into effect.

Trump and his team had already announced it was looking to exchange U.S. support for Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, which President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s administration appeared to be open to, but two things appear to be new here. First, the size of the deal, and second, that any deal wouldn&#x2019;t be in exchange for future support, but compensation for U.S. aid already provided to Ukraine. It&#x2019;s unclear yet if the shift in rhetoric changes Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to enter into such an agreement. We&#x2019;re likely to find out more in the coming days &#x2014; Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11 that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine this week to discuss a potential deal between Kyiv and Washington on critical minerals.

Just last week, Reuters reported that Ukraine would maintain a high level of gas imports of 16.3 million cubic meters on Feb. 9 after the country began sharply increasing imports following a series of Russian attacks on its gas facilities. Earlier in the week, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. Ukraine&#x2019;s daily gas consumption was about 110 million cubic meters last month, Serhiy Makogon, the former head of the country&#x2019;s transit operator, told Reuters.

Representatives of the government, technological companies, leading experts in the industry and the cyber community take part in discussions of various topics during the forum. (Photo by hurricanehank/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The year of KyivstarUkraine&#x2019;s anti-trust regulator approved Kyivstar&#x2019;s acquisition of taxi service Uklon, paving the way for its purchase, Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov announced at an American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine event on Feb. 6. That&#x2019;s big news on its own. Kyivstar is Ukraine&#x2019;s leading mobile operator &#x2014; Uklon, the country&#x2019;s most popular ride-hailing service. The deal is reportedly valued at $40-60 million. What&#x2019;s more interesting here is everything going on with Kyivstar as of late. At the start of the full-scale invasion, it was at risk of nationalization over its parent company Veon&#x2019;s Russian shareholders. But in the last couple of months, Kyivstar announced a deal with Elon Musk&#x2019;s Starlink to provide direct satellite-to-cell service. Last month, news broke that Kyivstar would be the first company to be listed on Nasdaq &#x2014; which Komarov said would likely happen in Q3 &#x2014; and now, the Uklon purchase. What does it all mean? As one colleague noted, the Nasdaq listing plans might be a way for Kyivstar to get away from its former Russian ties. Given French billionaire Xavier Niel&#x2019;s purchase of the third-largest mobile operator Lifecell last year, I&#x2019;d say developing telecoms &#x2014; which involves a country&#x2019;s critical infrastructure &#x2014; is a prime target for post-war investment in Ukraine.

(Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)Europe stepping inThe European Investment Bank announced on Feb. 10 that it had signed agreements to mobilize close to 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) in investments into Ukraine&#x2019;s public and private sectors &#x2014; a welcome move as the U.S. cuts funding abroad. Nadia Calvino, the EIB&apos;s president, said at a press briefing that she had discussed Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent funding needs with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to see where the bank could fill the gaps if international partners withdraw their support. &quot;We discussed the priority areas where the EIB could step up its support &#x2014; for example, in the areas of border management, transport, energy, and municipalities,&quot; Calvino said in Kyiv during her first visit to the country since taking up office as head of the EIB a year ago. The investment announced on Feb. 10 includes 420 million euros ($433 million) in Ukraine&#x2019;s public sector to help restore critical infrastructure such as energy, heating, water supply, hospitals, schools, and social housing. On the private sector side, the bank has signed an agreement to mobilize close to 500 million euros ($515 million) in financing for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the whole country, including in front-line regions, Calvino said.

Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted in favor of buying two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on Feb. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the lawmakers last week to approve the project, calling it a &quot;key to energy independence.&quot; Some lawmakers and anti-corruption activists have criticized the deal, arguing that the reactors are obsolete and expensive. The parliament has long struggled to pass the law, prompting Bulgaria to extend the deadline for concluding the deal until March. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, France&#x2019;s trade chief Laurent Saint-Martin said that France has been working with Ukraine on rare mineral exploitation for a long time, with French experts from organizations like BRGM and the inter-ministerial Direction for Rare Mineral Supply. &#x201C;France remains fully involved in this sector, and we continue discussions with Ukrainian authorities,&#x201D; Saint-Martin said. The European Union will receive a second tranche of 2 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from profits generated by frozen Russian Central Bank assets that are meant for Ukraine and its war effort. The clearing house said in a statement on Feb. 5 that the second payment is expected to be made in March and should amount to approximately 2 billion euros. Ukraine&apos;s newly formed telecommunications company DVL Group is planning to cut 15% of its IT department due to business consolidation and optimization, the company told Economichna Pravda on Feb. 4.

Russia's growing shadow fleet sends a dangerous signal, expert warns	Russia has resorted to a &quot;shadow fleet&quot; to transport its oil and gas to get around Western sanctions and price caps. These ships have murky owners and are difficult to trace. They are growing in number and helping keep Russia&apos;s war machine alive while posing security and environmental risks. So far, sanctions have failed to stop the fleet. But Western countries are upping efforts to crack down on the dangerous ships. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Transatlantic Security Initiative, to find out what options the West has and how dangerous the shadow fleet actually is.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-growing-shadow-fleet-sends-a-dangerous-signal-expert-warns/	2025-02-12T07:23:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/4_0.jpg
Kyiv and Washington’s mobilization age blame game misses the point	&#x201C;The biggest problem is the lack of people.&#x201D; These words, heard by journalists, including myself, from Ukrainian soldiers and commanders across the front line for the past year, are no outlier. For most of 2024 and into 2025, &#xA0;Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest issue on the battlefield has not been firepower but manpower &#x2014; specifically infantry. In the face of Russia&#x2019;s seemingly relentless assaults on multiple fronts, Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive infantry positions are often undermanned, and in some cases, as I have heard personally from soldiers fighting near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, not manned at all. Under these conditions, the Ukrainian military has been increasingly overstretched, opening up noticeable weak points in its lines that Russia has become better and better at exploiting. The solution seems obvious on the surface: Ukraine needs to bring more people into the army, both to replenish losses and to allow for proper rotation of front-line units. That means more mobilization, especially of men physically fit and strong enough to handle the brutal conditions of modern trench warfare. In a rare case of public pressure on Kyiv to change its internal policy on how the war is fought, representatives of the Biden administration, including then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and then-National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, called for further lowering the mobilization age to 18 on multiple occasions. The age was already lowered once in the first half of 2024, from 27 to 25, as part of broader changes to mobilization legislation that were passed by the parliament after months of deliberation and controversy. Wary of how such a move would exacerbate the internal tensions that forced mobilization already brings to wartime Ukrainian society, President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the idea outright. He argues that without the promised equipment for new brigades, taking more young men out of civilian life makes no sense. &#x201C;We must focus on equipping existing brigades and training personnel to use this equipment,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a post on X on Dec. 10. &#x201C;We must not compensate for the lack of equipment and training with the youth of soldiers.&#x201D; Now, mobilization age could be one of the rare issues where the new Trump administration aligns with its predecessor on Ukraine. Speaking on ABC News just a week before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, then-nominee and now National Security Advisor Mike Waltz again pushed the issue. &quot;If Ukrainians have asked the entire world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy... We need to see those manpower issues addressed,&quot; he said. Though hopeful early signs suggest Trump will broadly support Kyiv&#x2019;s call for &#x201C;peace through strength,&#x201D; the mobilization age debate threatens to become a dangerous flashpoint in the future of bilateral cooperation. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. The blame game between Washington and Kyiv must be nipped in the bud because if it isn&#x2019;t, their common aim &#x2014; forcing Russia to abandon its war of conquest &#x2014; will not just suffer but could collapse entirely. Ukrainian military personnel are awarded medals for their service on Ukraine Defender Day near Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Pierre Crom / Getty Images)Both sides have seemingly reasonable arguments, but they obscure deeper issues under the surface. Washington&#x2019;s demand for Kyiv to simply be &#x201C;all in&#x201D; and lower the mobilization age coldly ignores how painful the human cost of three years of full-scale war has been for Ukraine. No sovereign country in the 21st century should have to endure what Ukraine has suffered: a campaign of strategic attrition waged by a much larger neighbor, blending Soviet-style human wave tactics with the brutality of modern drone warfare. Forced mobilization on a large scale &#x2014; especially when voluntary enlistment has plummeted &#x2014; represents, in many ways, a fundamental breakdown of the social contract between state and citizen. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing his own manpower issues, has been desperate to avoid a large-scale forced mobilization, despite the chance of internal unrest being close to zero. Ukraine, as a democracy built on individual rights and freedoms, faces an even greater challenge. It&#x2019;s easy to point from a safe Western country to the existential threat faced by Ukraine and expect military-aged men to still be lining up to fight as they did in 2022. But for young men bombarded with images and stories of the horrors of the trenches for three years, serving in infantry is often seen as a one-way ticket to injury or death. On top of that, the demographic argument is well-documented: the generation Washington wants to make eligible for forced mobilization is not only one of the smallest in Ukraine&#x2019;s population pyramid but is also crucial for rebuilding the country&#x2019;s postwar future. Chasing a delusional scenario in which neither Ukraine or Russia is defeated and the world eventually goes back to normal, the U.S.&#x2019; policy of holding back key weapons systems for years and drip feeding aid to Ukraine &#x201C;as long as it takes&#x201D; remains the main reason Kyiv finds itself in this position now, seemingly running out of manpower. That said, Kyiv&#x2019;s rebuttal &#x2014; that Ukraine needs more weapons, not conscripts &#x2014; is also fundamentally dishonest with respect to the reality on the ground. This failure was starkly exposed around New Year&#x2019;s with Ukraine&#x2019;s newly formed 155th Mechanized Brigade &#x2014; trained and equipped by France as the intended poster child of a new program where foreign partners each took on a brigade. The deal was meant to be simple: France provides the heavy weapons, while Ukraine supplies the personnel. Paris kept its end of the bargain, but Kyiv failed to do so. Ukraine peeled off bits of the brigade to plug holes in the front line, resulting in a poorly organized and unmotivated brigade that saw over 1,000 desertions before firing a shot. The 155th is not the only such problematic case, but part of a tendency that was so damaging that Zelensky moved to cancel the formation of further new brigades in January. Ukraine&#x2019;s chronic struggles with building effective fortified defensive lines ahead of Russian offensives, as well as its Soviet-style command culture, marked by frantic withdrawals from near-surrounded cities, have also led to higher losses than necessary. While Ukraine does need a greater inflow of physically fit men to refill its ranks, it must first improve how it utilizes the human resources it already has. There&#x2019;s little point in exacerbating domestic tensions with a new law to draft tens of thousands of younger Ukrainian men if they are sent into an environment of poor training and leadership, where their chances of survival are already slim. Recent decisions to cancel the formation of new brigades and shift the military into a corps-based system offer hope that Kyiv is beginning to address these issues. Having said this, yes, Kyiv does need to face the mobilization problem head on: Ultimately, when it comes to acknowledging the problems that plague the defense of the country, there is no getting around the basic need for more people. Part of that likely means lowering the mobilization age, if not to 18, then perhaps to 21. If the last mobilization law is anything to go by, this process could drag out for months, as Ukrainian lawmakers from all parties avoid association with the unpopular measure. Again, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. Just as with other urgent internal issues, the first step is to take responsibility &#x2014; to prioritize Ukraine&#x2019;s future over short-term approval ratings. 2025 could bring peace to Ukraine, but only if Russian forces are halted by a strong, consolidated Ukrainian defense. Even if a peace deal doesn&#x2019;t return occupied Ukrainian territory, it can&#x2019;t come about without first shattering Moscow&#x2019;s conviction that it can break Ukraine. This monumental task can only be achieved together: both Kyiv and Washington must do everything possible to pressure Russia, on the battlefield and the world stage. To do that, they must align their vision, communicate clearly, and most importantly, stop expecting the other to do more before acting themselves. Ukraine&#x2019;s manpower crisis is a great place to start.

Ukraine introduces 1-year military contract for young volunteers, facing mixed reactions	Ukraine&apos;s government approved a one-year contract for volunteers aged 18-24 on Feb. 11, aiming to boost recruitment with financial incentives and social benefits, but the decision has sparked mixed reactions within the military community. The contract includes basic general military training, vocational training, and an adaptation course in an army unit. Volunteers will receive a one-time monetary aid payment of Hr 1 million ($24,000) and a monthly allowance of up to Hr 120,000 ($3,000). The move comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. for Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. President Volodymyr Zelensky has resisted lowering the draft age, arguing it could harm Ukraine&apos;s long-term future. Instead, Ukraine aims to attract younger volunteer recruits through benefits, such as a 0% mortgage after completing service and social guarantees. Upon completion, volunteers will have the right to travel abroad and be exempt from mobilization for 12 months. The military faces a critical personnel shortfall, struggling to replenish infantry gaps amid battlefield losses. The current mobilization system requires indefinite service, discouraging enlistment, while the new contract is designed to appeal to young volunteers unwilling to commit long-term. The decision has drawn criticism from frontline soldiers, with some questioning why existing troops receive fewer benefits. Ukrainian soldier and paramedic Alina Mykhailova voiced her frustration, asking, &quot;Why are those who enlisted earlier in a worse position? Where are their guarantees, social protection, and fair service bonus?&quot; Former soldier and journalist Masi Nayem echoed the sentiment, saying he received messages from comrades expressing dissatisfaction: &quot;It seems that choosing between unpopular decisions, they decided to disregard the motivation of those already in service.&quot; The Defense Ministry has yet to respond to concerns raised by active-duty soldiers, but the debate underscores the broader challenge of balancing recruitment efforts with maintaining morale among Ukraine&apos;s existing forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-one-year-contracts-for-volunteers-aged-18-24-defense-ministry-says/	2025-02-12T06:14:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243729890.jpg
Ukrainian draft officer attacked at Kharkiv military enlistment office	A Ukrainian Armed Forces service member was injured in a violent attack at a military enlistment office in Kharkiv on Feb. 12, the office said, adding that the suspect had been detained. The incident follows a series of recent attacks against military enlistment officers. Last week, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) revealed that Russia recruited the perpetrator of an explosion at a draft office in Rivne on Feb. 1 that injured eight service members and killed the suspected bomber. In the Kharkiv attack, the assailant reportedly used tear gas and stabbed the service member, who has been hospitalized. His life is not in danger, the enlistment office said. &quot;An attack on a serviceman in the line of duty is a serious crime that must be investigated as soon as possible,&quot; the statement read. The incident occurred in Kharkiv&apos;s Saltivskyi district as the draft officer was carrying out checks of personal military data. The 35-year-old suspect attempted to flee the scene but was detained, the National Police said. The attack is being investigated as an attempted murder and obstruction of military activities, with the suspect potentially facing up to 15 years in prison or life imprisonment. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Another explosion near a military enlistment office in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv faces challenges in mobilizing troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-attacked-at-military-enlistment-office-in-kharkiv/	2025-02-12T06:04:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg
NATO reaction to Russian attack would be 'devastating,' Rutte warns	NATO&apos;s reaction to a potential Russian attack would be &quot;devastating,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said during a press conference ahead of the defense ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12. &quot;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin attacks NATO, the reaction will be devastating. He will lose,&quot; Rutte said. Allied and Ukrainian officials are gathering at the NATO headquarters for a ministerial meeting and the 26th summit of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) to coordinate strategy in fending off Russian aggression in Ukraine. The meetings come at an uncertain time as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a quick peace deal in Ukraine while being evasive on the question of military support for the besieged country. Trump&apos;s return to the White House also spells uncertainty for the alliance. His past comments have cast doubt on his readiness to assist European allies in case of Russian aggression. When asked whether he is worried about Trump&apos;s willingness to aid Europe in case of another conflict, Rutte said European countries are currently addressing weaknesses in their own defense capabilities. Defense spending will be at the top of the agenda of the ministerial meeting, Rutte said, adding that he expects the allies to raise the spending benchmarks from 2% of GDP to &quot;north of 3%.&quot; Trump has previously urged NATO partners to hike defense spending to as much as 5%, a level not achieved by a single member, including the U.S., in 2024. During the press conference, the secretary-general backed Trump&apos;s stance that Europe should ramp up its support for Ukraine to make it more &quot;equalized&quot; in regard to the U.S. &quot;The stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger they will be at the negotiating table,&quot; Rutte concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-reaction-to-russian-attack-will-be-devastating-rutte-warns/	2025-02-12T05:48:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
US to release Russian citizen in exchange for Fogel 'in coming days,' Kremlin claims	Washington agreed to release a Russian national held in a U.S. prison after Moscow freed American citizen Marc Fogel, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the pro-state Russian news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 12. &quot;A Russian citizen will return to Russia in the coming days,&quot; Peskov said without revealing his identity. Fogel, a schoolteacher detained at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana, was flown out of Russia on Feb. 11 by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for agreeing to the deal and called it a step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. The U.S. president did not reveal what Moscow would receive in return, saying only that the Russian side did not ask for &quot;much.&quot; When asked by a journalist whether the Russian citizen involved in the exchange is Alexander Vinnik, a suspected cybercriminal detained in Greece in 2017, Peskov declined to confirm and said the name would be announced once the individual was in Russia. The Kremlin&apos;s spokesperson did not provide further details about the talks between Washington and Moscow but noted that the contacts have intensified over the past few days. The U.S. and Russia have carried out a number of prisoner exchanges over the past few years, with the largest one taking place in August 2024. At the time, the Biden administration negotiated the release of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, ex-Marine Paul Whelan, and a number of Russian opposition figures in exchange for spies, assassins, and cyber-criminals held in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-release-russian-citizen-in-exchange-for-fogel/	2025-02-12T04:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198419238.jpg
Zelensky ready to meet Trump in US once details are arranged	President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to meet his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, in the U.S. once the date and other details are agreed upon, Zelensky said in an interview with The Guardian published in full on Feb. 12. &quot;As for President Trump, he said he was waiting for me in Washington. And we are very much looking forward to our teams agreeing on the dates and other details for a meeting in the U.S.,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. Zelensky&apos;s comments follow Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 7 that the two leaders may meet in Washington this week. The Ukrainian president indicated that no specific plans for a bilateral meeting have been set. &quot;As soon as this is agreed, I am ready for the meeting,&quot; Zelensky added. Later this week, Ukraine&apos;s head of state is expected to meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance during the Munich Security Conference. The Trump administration has intensified contact with both Kyiv and Moscow as the U.S. president aims to broker a swift peace deal and end the full-scale war nearing its third anniversary. While providing little details on how he plans to achieve a settlement, Trump suggested that Ukraine could secure U.S. support in exchange for its rare earth minerals. Zelensky said in the interview that he is ready to discuss various options for the resource extraction deal as long as they are &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to visit Ukraine this week to discuss the rare earth deal, while Trump&apos;s special peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, is set to arrive on Feb. 20. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also met U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for the first time on Feb. 12 on the sidelines of the Ramstein-format meeting in Brussels. Separately, Trump has claimed he held one or more phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and voiced intent to meet the Russian leader in person, a step welcomed by the Kremlin.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-ready-to-meet-trump-in-us/	2025-02-12T04:18:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361-1.jpg
Kremlin rejects territorial exchange in potential Ukraine peace talks	Russia has ruled out any discussion of exchanging territories in potential negotiations with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 12, according to the state news agency TASS. Peskov&apos;s statement follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks in an interview with The Guardian, where he suggested Ukraine could cede the territory it controls in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in exchange for Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. &quot;This is impossible. Russia has never discussed and will never discuss the topic of exchanging its territory,&quot; Peskov responded. Kyiv has previously signaled that its cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast, launched in August 2024, could be used in potential peace talks with Russia. Zelensky now confirmed that the offer could be on the table if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in opening negotiations. Peskov claimed that Russia would be able to expel Ukrainian forces from its territory. While Moscow has reclaimed some lost ground in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces continue holding positions in the region and recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles). Zelensky did not specify what regions could be exchanged for Kursk Oblast territories. Russia holds roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s land and illegally announced the annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian regions &#x2013; the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts &#x2013; in September 2022. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin named a complete Ukrainian withdrawal from these regions as a key condition for talks, which Kyiv rejected. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has gained momentum since Trump took office on Jan. 20. His administration has set a 100-day goal to broker a resolution, with special envoy Keith Kellogg expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. The Kremlin has already indicated readiness to hold talks with Trump regarding the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/territorial-exchange-impossible-in-any-peace-negotiations-kremlin-spox-says/	2025-02-12T04:02:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
Ukraine's SBU detains its counter-terrorist center chief accused of working for Russia	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the head of the agency&apos;s counter-terrorism department, who is suspected of working for Russian intelligence, SBU head Vasyl Maliuk announced on Feb. 12. While the agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s name, the Kyiv Independent&apos;s SBU sources identified him as Colonel Dmytro Koziura. The suspect&apos;s illicit activities were documented in 14 separate cases, according to Maliuk. The SBU chief emphasized that the operation to uncover and detain him required &quot;all possible overt and covert methods.&quot; The case sheds light on Russian efforts to infiltrate and undermine Ukraine&apos;s security services amid the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. &quot;In the process, we managed to document the collection and transmission of relevant information to Russia,&quot; Maliuk added. The suspect was said to be working with Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB). &quot;Using encrypted software bookmarks, we penetrated the traitor&apos;s gadgets &#x2014; mobile terminals and computers. We basically lived with him and conducted audio and video monitoring,&quot; the SBU chief added. The SBU head described the operation as part of an ongoing internal purge and warned that no Russian infiltration attempts would succeed. Further details of the case are expected to be released soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-captures-anti-terrorist-center-chief-suspected-of-working-for-russia/	2025-02-12T03:33:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/download.jpg
Europe faces 'total' Russian occupation without Ukraine's army, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that without Ukraine, Europe could face a full-scale Russian occupation due to Moscow&apos;s numerical advantage in forces, he said in a segment of an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 12. Zelensky highlighted the disparity in forces between Russia and Europe, saying that Ukraine&apos;s army consists of 110 brigades, while Russia fields 220 and plans to expand to 250 this year. In contrast, Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades. &quot;Without Ukraine, Europe will be totally occupied by Russia, if they want. And I believe they (Russia) have nothing else on their mind,&quot; the president said in the interview. &quot;Today, an army of 110 brigades is holding back those who have 220-230. But it&apos;s one to two,&quot; Zelensky added. The president said that while Russia&apos;s numeral advantage compared to Ukraine is two to one, in comparison to Europe, it&apos;s three to one, which is sufficient for an effective offensive. Zelensky added that Russia intends to increase its forces by 12-15 divisions &#x2014; around 150,000 troops &#x2014; through mobilization, training, and the addition of North Korean soldiers. According to the president, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence also suggests that new Russian recruits will be trained in Belarus. &quot;After that, they can launch a full-scale ivasion from there. But who said that it would be to Ukraine? Russia can invade Poland or Lithuania,&quot; Zelensky warned. The president said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Zelensky also disclosed in the interview that an assassination attempt on him at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 led to casualties inside the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-could-face-russian-occupation-without-ukraines-army-zelensky-warns/	2025-02-12T03:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247442902-1677276960d6gz6.jpg
Defense Minister Umerov meets Pentagon chief Hegseth for the first time	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for the first time on Feb. 12 on the sidelines of the Ramstein-format meeting in Brussels. The 26th summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) is the first one chaired by the U.K. rather than the U.S. as Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s accession to office. Umerov did not provide any details on his meeting with the U.S. defense secretary. The summit, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. This marks the first Ramstein summit during U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has prompted concerns not only about the future of the UDCG but also about the overall allied support for Ukraine. While pledging to broker a swift peace deal, the U.S. president has been evasive regarding the continued military backing for Kyiv.

Russian missile attack on Kyiv damages state-run TV channel's office	A Russian ballistic missile strike on Kyiv on Feb. 12 damaged the office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim, the news channels announced. The office sustained damage to windows and equipment, but the channels said they remain operational. The statements mentioned no casualties. According to a TSN journalist on the ground, everything within a 300-meter radius was damaged; parts of the facades were demolished, and doors were blown off. &quot;For terrorists who violate any conventions and disregard international law, the media is a desirable target,&quot; the Freedom TV channel said in a statement. Russia has previously targeted Ukraine&apos;s media infrastructure, including a strike on Kharkiv&apos;s TV broadcasting tower in April 2024 and Kyiv&apos;s TV tower in March 2022. The morning attack on Kyiv struck an industrial zone housing multiple office centers. Footage from the scene shows shattered glass, structural damage to buildings, and wrecked cars. At least one person was killed and four injured in the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv-damages-freedom-tv-channel-office/	2025-02-12T02:33:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/4-1.jpg
People were killed inside Presidential Office' — Zelensky comments on Russia's assassination attempts in 2022	An attempt to assassinate &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 resulted in people killed inside the Presidential Office, Zelensky said in an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. &quot;There were people who wanted to kill (me), there were gunshots, and more. Some people were killed here, inside the Presidential Office, others were defending us,&quot; Zelensky revealed. Zelensky did not specify whether the fatalities included Russians, Ukrainians, or both. The comments shed further light on previously reported attempts by Russia to eliminate the Ukrainian leadership in Kyiv in early 2022. At least three assassination attempts at Zelensky were reported by March 2022 as Russian forces were pushing toward Ukraine&apos;s capital before being defeated in the battle of Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/people-were-killed-inside-presidential-office-zelensky-reveals-details-of-russias-assassination-attempts-in-2022/	2025-02-12T01:53:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Russia's sanctioned ex-central bank official takes up in-person IMF duties in Washington	Former Russian Deputy Central Bank Governor Ksenia Yudaeva, who is under U.S. sanctions, is working in person at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, Russia&apos;s state news agency TASS reported on Feb. 11. Yudaeva has moved to Washington after the U.S. Treasury Department, still under the Biden administration at the time, granted her permission to transition from remote to in-person duties as Russia&apos;s IMF executive director, Bloomberg reported in January, citing sources. Yudaeva, sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, previously served as an advisor to Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. In November 2024, Yudaeva was appointed to represent Russia and Syria at the IMF but was initially working remotely. The IMF executive board is comprised of 25 directors who are elected by member countries or coalitions. While each director has voting power, influence is primarily determined by a nation&apos;s financial contributions to the organization. Though the decision to allow Yudaeva to work in Washington was reportedly made by the Biden administration, the sanctioned Russian official began working in the U.S. amid President Donald Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow to broker a peace deal in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctioned-russian-deputy-central-bank-governor-yudaeva-resumes-in-person-duties-at-imf/	2025-02-12T01:39:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-948228448.jpg
Coordinating allied support — Umerov lists Ukraine's priorities at Ramstein-format summit	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has begun his work at the 26th Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12, the first event of its kind not chaired by the U.S. The meeting, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. &quot;The main goal is strengthening military cooperation and real mechanisms to support Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. The agenda includes ensuring a stable and timely supply of military aid in 2025, accelerating the delivery of critical weapons like air defense systems, aviation, and ammunition, and fostering joint projects with European partners. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses.

Pentagon chief Hegseth arrives in Brussels ahead of Ramstein-format meeting	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Feb. 12 as the allies are gathering for a Ramstein-format meeting. The U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s accession to office. &quot;Our commitment is clear: NATO must be a stronger, more lethal force&#x2014;not a diplomatic club. Time for allies to meet the moment,&quot; Hegseth said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-chief-hegseth-arrives-in-brussels-for-ramstein-meeting/	2025-02-12T00:50:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GjkpbskWsAAsIip.jpg
Russia braces for economic crisis as it revives Covid-era committee	Russia has reactivated a special economic commission initially created during the Covid-19 pandemic to monitor struggling industries and implement relief measures, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 11, citing Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. The news comes as the Kremlin reportedly grows increasingly concerned by the state of Russia&apos;s economy amid Western sanctions and soaring inflation caused by record wartime spending. Novak said that the commission resumed work in December 2024, focusing on nine key sectors and over 2,000 enterprises. Among the primary risks is a &quot;decline in investment activity,&quot; according to Novak. Several industries, including coal, metallurgy, and timber, are experiencing sharp downturns due to sanctions and falling exports. Coal companies, facing an 80 billion ruble ($845 million) loss from plummeting exports, have begun closing mines, prompting fears of mass bankruptcies. The government is already formulating support measures. Russia&apos;s metallurgical plants, struggling with reduced access to foreign markets, are also expected to receive state assistance, followed by the timber industry, whose exports have dropped by a third. The agricultural sector is also distressed, suffering from drought and poor harvests. Russia&apos;s wheat production declined by 16% in 2024, while corn, barley, and sugar beet yields dropped by nearly 20%. On Feb. 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that inflation remains a significant challenge, directing the government to implement measures to stabilize prices in 2025. According to The Moscow Times, consumer prices rose 9.5% in 2024 and have since climbed to 9.9% year over year. The Russian Central Bank, which has maintained an interest rate of 21%, sees &quot;no signs of a sustainable slowdown in price growth&quot; due to sanctions, currency depreciation, and high defense spending. The Central Bank forecasts inflation to drop to 5.2% and 8.6% by the end of 2025. Its next policy meeting on Feb. 14 will determine further economic stabilization measures.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reactivates-special-economic-commission-to-monitor-struggling-industries/	2025-02-12T00:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2153661926.jpg
German Navy facing sabotage attempts, navy chief says; warns of Russian threat	Germany&apos;s Navy has recently encountered repeated sabotage attempts, German Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Jan Christian Kaack told N-TV on Feb. 11, presenting them as an effort to &quot;test&quot; NATO. Kaack said the incidents included infiltration attempts at naval bases from land and sea, as well as direct damage to vessels. While he did not specify the perpetrators, he warned that such actions were likely part of efforts to &quot;undermine public confidence&quot; and destabilize NATO. The reports come amid growing concerns over Russian hybrid warfare tactics across Europe. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage of undersea cables linking Latvia, Sweden, and Finland, have heightened security fears and led to ramped-up allied presence in the region. &quot;In our assessment, we are being tested. They are trying to undermine the confidence of our society &#x2014; both at the national level and within the (NATO) alliance. And they are setting the stage for subsequent active military action,&quot; Kaack said. One high-profile case involved the discovery of tens of kilograms of metal shavings inside the engine of the German Navy&apos;s new Emden corvette at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the S&#xFC;ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters WDR and NDR reported. The debris could have caused significant damage if undetected, delaying the ship&apos;s transfer to the Navy. Investigators have not confirmed sabotage, but authorities are still examining the incident. Germany has stepped up countermeasures, Kaack added, emphasizing that the Russian threat in early 2025 is more severe than two years ago. He warned that experts and intelligence services anticipate Russia could be in a position to launch a conflict with NATO as early as 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-navy-sees-sabotage-attempts-amid-war-in-ukraine-navy-chief-says/	2025-02-12T00:05:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1241200421.jpg
Trump praises Putin for US teacher's release, says it could help end Russia-Ukraine war	U.S. President Donald Trump met Marc Fogel at the White House on Feb. 11 after the U.S. schoolteacher was freed from a Russian prison in a deal negotiated between Moscow and Washington. Fogel, arrested at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana, was released in an agreement brokered by Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. &quot;There&apos;s good will in terms of the war,&quot; Trump said when asked if Fogel&apos;s release could be a step toward a peace deal in Ukraine. &quot;You (Fogel) could be a big part of it, actually, because it could be a big, important part of getting the war over with Ukraine.&quot; &quot;And we appreciate President (Vladimir) Putin for what he did,&quot; Trump added. When asked by a journalist whether Russia received anything in return for Fogel&apos;s release, Trump said, &quot;Not much, no. We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that&apos;s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.&quot; The U.S. president also claimed the deal was &quot;very fair, very reasonable&quot; and hinted that &quot;somebody else is being released tomorrow.&quot; Fogel&apos;s release follows Trump&apos;s claims of speaking with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, though the Kremlin has not confirmed these discussions. The U.S. president has pledged to broker a swift end to the Russia-Ukraine war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve that. Witkoff flew Fogel out of Russia on his private plane, marking the first known visit of a U.S. official to Moscow since 2021. The U.S. government classified Fogel as &quot;unjustly detained&quot; in December 2024, increasing diplomatic efforts to secure his release. Fogel&apos;s family had pushed for the designation after he was excluded from a high-profile prisoner swap in August 2024 that freed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive and ex-Marine Paul Whelan. Russia has detained several U.S. nationals since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with many serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. The U.S. has denounced many of these arrests as unjust and politically motivated. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who met U.S. Ambassador in Moscow Lynne Tracy just hours before Fogel&apos;s release, said in December 2024 that Moscow was open to further prisoner exchanges with the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-praises-putin-for-fogel-release-says-it-could-help-end-russias-war/	2025-02-11T23:24:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198417355.jpg

Russia offers to produce advanced stealth fighter jet for Indian Air Force, Reuters reports	Russia has offered to manufacture its fifth-generation Su-57 stealth fighter jet for the Indian Air Force amid deepening ties between Moscow and New Delhi, Reuters reported on Feb. 11, citing two officials. The fighter jet, which would be produced in India, comes as informal conversations continue between Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and Indian government officials for the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics, a Russian industry source told Reuters. A spokesperson for Rosoboronexport confirmed that production of the aircraft may begin as early as this year if India agrees to a deal. For years, Russia has been the largest arms supplier to India, although sanctions implemented on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have forced India to search out weapons supplies from Western countries. The Su-57, Russia&#x2019;s most modern fighter jet, has faced criticism as being plagued with mechanical challenges. The first non-prototype version crashed during a test flight in December 2019, and has been dubbed by some experts as the &quot;worst of the world&#x2019;s stealth fighters.&quot; In June 2024, a Russian versions of the aircraft were reportedly damaged after a Ukrainian strike on the Akhtubinsk airfield in the Astrakhan region in southern Russia, 589 kilometers from the front line. India previously withdrew from the project to co-develop and produce the aircraft with Russia. Despite this, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to boost defense spending and production as longstanding regional tensions with Pakistan and China persist. While India has maintained its call for a diplomatic resolution to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, it continues to deepen economic ties with Moscow. Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in July. The two countries identified nine areas for enhanced cooperation, ranging from nuclear energy to medicine. India and Russia also aim to boost bilateral trade by over 50%, targeting $100 billion annually by 2030. In December 2024, Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and Indian refining giant Reliance Industries have finalized a landmark agreement to supply 500,000 barrels of oil daily for the next 10 years, marking the largest energy partnership between the two nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-offers-to-produce-advanced-stealth-fighter-jet-for-indian-air-force-reuters-reports/	2025-02-11T21:01:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184333392.jpg
Fires reported in Kyiv following overnight missile attacks	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a missile attack against Kyiv on the morning of Feb. 12. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv City Military Administration reported that fires had broken out in the Solomianskyi and Svyatoshynskyi districts of the city. No further information was immediately available as to the extent of any damage or casualties. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that emergency crews are on their way to various parts of the city. Explosions were reported in Kyiv around 4:30 a.m. local time, according to several Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Preliminary reports indicate that four Iskander ballistic missiles were launched towards the capital. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned of the threat of Russian missile attacks targeting various regions of the country. Klitschko said that air defenses are at work in the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-following-missile-attack-on-kyiv/	2025-02-11T18:56:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/_DSF3368.jpg
Russia may find opportunity to launch large-scale war on Europe within 5 years, Danish intelligence warns	Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years, if Moscow &quot;perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,&quot; an unclassified intelligence assessment from the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS) warned. &quot;Russia perceives itself as being in conflict with the West and is preparing for a war against NATO. While no decision to initiate such a war has been made, Russia is building the capacity to make that choice if deemed necessary,&quot; the report, published on Feb. 9, warned. The latest intelligence assessment comes amid a series of increasingly dire warnings from Western leaders and defense officials about the threat emanating from Russia and Europe&apos;s current lack of preparedness. The DDIS in its report noted that fracturing among alliance members could present an opportunity for Moscow to capitalize, particularly if the United States is unwilling to protect its European allies. U.S. President Donald Trump sparked international outrage in February 2024 when he said he would urge Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, in a declaration indicating his disregard for the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle. Since being inaugurated, Trump has raised the ire of NATO allies by not ruling out using military force to gain control of Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark, as well as using economic coercion to force Canada to become a state. The DDIS report assessed that Russia may be able to wage war with a neighboring country within six month if it is able to reallocate military resources from Ukraine in the event of a frozen conflict or the end of the war. The report also concluded that Moscow poses a regional threat to Baltic states within two years, and a large-scale war with Europe in five years, presuming the U.S. does not intervene. The report acknowledges that the evolution of the Ukraine war will likely dictate Russia&apos;s future intention, adding that &quot;it is unlikely that Russia could sustain both the war in Ukraine and a simultaneous war with NATO.&quot; The report also does not account for an increase in NATO&apos;s military capabilities to match that of Moscow. On Dec. 12, the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump called for an even more radical increase, up to 5% of GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-find-opportunity-to-launch-large-scale-war-on-europe-within-5-years-danish-intelligence-warns/	2025-02-11T17:53:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1174515273.jpg
Ukraine will no longer create new brigades, official says	Ukraine will no longer form new military brigades, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa said in a television interview on Feb. 11. His comments come as Ukraine&apos;s army is set to reform its structure, introducing a corps system to replace its current brigade-level system. The government will now focus on strengthening existing brigades operating in combat zones by replenishing them, Palisa said. &quot;There is a detailed plan... In my opinion, the transition to a corps system is long overdue,&quot; Palisa said. &quot;This... is not just a matter of time, it will allow us to be more effective on the battlefield in terms of management and use resources more efficiently.&quot; Training will continue in existing brigades taking into account situations that arose in the past, Palisa added, possibly referring to recent military controversies. Ukrainian authorities have faced criticism for shortcomings in the military, including problems with the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov ordered an investigation on Dec. 16 into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers in the 211th Brigade by their commanders. The incidents involving the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade garnered widespread backlash. In one of the alleged cases of abuse, Senior Lieutenant Vladyslav Pastukh ordered subordinates to tie a victim to a wooden cross, where the soldier was immobilized for four hours. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed a military ombudsman to oversee conditions in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-no-longer-create-new-brigades-official-says/	2025-02-11T16:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247428702-1.jpg
Hungarian deputy FM arrives in Ukraine, demands explanation for 'slander campaign'	Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar criticized Ukrainian officials for a so-called &quot;slanderous campaign&quot; against Hungary in a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 11. Hungarian authorities have criticized Ukraine in the past, often repeating Kremlin propaganda. Budapest is regarded as Moscow&apos;s key ally in the European Union. Hungarian intelligence services have evidence of a &quot;slanderous campaign against Hungary&quot; backed by Ukraine, Magyar claimed in a Facebook post. &quot;The government will protect the country from all attempts at external influence, as there is nothing more important to us than the interests of Hungary,&quot; he said. Magyar did not cite evidence to support his allegations of a Ukrainian-backed slander campaign against Hungary. He said he was in Kyiv to ask Ukrainian authorities for &quot;explanations&quot; and to discuss Budapest&apos;s &quot;possible response.&quot; Magyar also accused Ukraine of restricting the rights of Hungarians living in Zakarpattia Oblast, a border region with Hungary. Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian government denies. Hungary feels it has been stabbed in the back after coordinating humanitarian support for Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Magyar said. The Hungarian government under Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked aid to Kyiv, delayed sanctions against Moscow, and downplayed Russian aggression against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s other key ally in Europe, Slovakia, has also recently accused Ukraine of backing a hostile campaign to disrupt the government. Both Hungary and Slovakia are heavily reliant on Russian gas, which Ukraine recently stopped transporting to Europea via its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-deputy-foreign-minister-arrives-in-ukraine-demands-explanation-for-slander/	2025-02-11T16:06:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-5_14_55-PM.png
US, UK, Australia sanction Russian cyber firm Zservers over ransomware attacks	The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia jointly imposed sanctions on the Russian cyber company Zservers for its role in ransomware attacks, the U.S. Treasury Department announced on Feb. 11. Zservers, a bulletproof hosting (BPH) services provider, supported the cybercrime group LockBit in perpetrating mass ransomware attacks, the department said. The sanctions against Zservers build upon penalties the three countries imposed last year against LockBit leaders. Lockbit, a prolific ransomware group, has carried out thousands of &#xA0;cyberattacks in the U.S. and Europe, resulting in losses of billions of euros. &quot;Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on U.S. and international critical infrastructure,&quot; said U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith. &quot;Today&apos;s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.&quot; The U.S. sanctions target Alexander Igorevich Mishin and Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov, both Russian nationals and adminstrators of Zservers. Their assets have been frozen and they are prohibited from financial transactions with institutions or individuals in the U.S. Financial institutions or other persons that do business with Zservers could also be exposed to sanctions. In addition to Mishin and Bolshakov, the U.K. named four other Zservers employees in its action against the company. &#xA0; &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin has built a corrupt mafia state&#x202F;driven by greed and ruthlessness,&quot; U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement. &quot;It is no surprise that the most unscrupulous extortionists and cyber-criminals run rampant from within his borders. This government will continue to work with partners to constrain the Kremlin and the impact of Russia&apos;s lawless cyber underworld.&quot; The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions against Russian hacker networks and cybercriminals. Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections. U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled willingness to step up sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Putin to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-uk-australia-sanction-russian-cyber-firm-zservers-over-ransomware-attacks/	2025-02-11T15:07:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197448662.jpg
Foreign Ministry denounces corruption allegations made by Tucker Carlson	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi denied corruption allegations by far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson in a social media post on Feb. 11. Carlson had earlier claimed that U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are resold on the black market, accusing the Ukrainian military of selling arms &quot;to drug cartels.&quot; Carlson provided no evidence to support his allegations. Tykhyi decried Carlson&apos;s claims in a post on X. &quot;This is a lie,&quot; the spokesperson said. Multiple U.S. inspections have never revealed the exploitation of military aid provided to Ukraine, Tykhyi added. &quot;Every piece of military equipment delivered to Ukraine is tracked. All supplied weapons are monitored by independent mechanisms.&quot; Tucker Carlson has previously repeated the Kremlin&apos;s talking points, and infamously interviewed both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Carlson for spreading Russian propaganda on Feb. 4. Carlson, a far-right media personality, is also a close ally of U.S. Presidend Donald Trump, whose return to the White House marks a shift in U.S. policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Other Trump allies have been scrutinized for their connections to Russia. Kash Patel, Trump&apos;s nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-denounces-tucker-carlsons-claims-of-corruption/	2025-02-11T14:18:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
Trump envoy who negotiated prisoner release secretly assigned to help end Ukraine war, NYT reports	Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, has been secretly tasked with helping negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 11, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes on the same day the White House announced that Witkoff successfully negotiated a deal with Russia to secure the release of imprisoned American teacher, Marc Fogel. Trump directed Witkoff weeks ago to expand his role beyond the Middle East and help play a part in the Ukraine peace process, multiple people told the NYT. While Trump has already appointed retired general Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, he believes Witkoff can successfully manage negotiations with the Russian side, sources said. Witkoff, a real estate billionaire, is a close personal friend of Trump. He flew to Russia himself to fly Fogel out of the country on his private jet &#x2014;&#xA0;the first time a senior U.S. official has been known to visit Moscow since 2021. According to the NYT&apos;s sources, Witkoff spoke directly with close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of his visit. Sources said Witkoff has also discussed Ukraine with contacts in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz called the deal to relase Fogel an &quot;exchange,&quot; but it is not clear what Russia is gaining in the agreement. Waltz also said the deal marked a sign of progress toward ending &quot;the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.&quot; Witkoff&apos;s authority regarding the Ukraine-Russia peace process is unclear, the NYT reported. Trump has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end the full-scale war, now nearing its third year. Kellogg, who is set to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, is reportedly preparing several options for a ceasefire deal to be presented to the White House. Trump claimed on Feb. 9 that he was in contact with Putin and had discussed ending the war in Ukraine with the Russian leader. U.S. and Russian officials have not confirmed or denied these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-envoy-who-negotiated-prisoner-release-secretly-assigned-to-help-end-ukraine-war-nyt-reports/	2025-02-11T13:54:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197640711.jpg
Russia releases imprisoned American teacher in 'exchange' deal	The Kremlin on Feb. 11 released Marc Fogel, a U.S. schoolteacher jailed in Russia on drug charges, in a deal negotiated with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport for possessing marijuana, which his family and supporters say was prescribed for medical use. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Russia released Fogel on Feb. 11 in an &quot;exchange,&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement. Witkoff flew Fogel out of the country on his own private plane, marking the first known visit of a U.S. official to Moscow since 2021. The details of the exchange deal with Russia have not been disclosed. The U.S. government officially classified Fogel as &quot;unjustly detained&quot; in December 2024, a classification that typically increases diplomatic efforts to secure a detainee&#x2019;s release. Fogel&apos;s family pushed for the designation after Fogel was excluded from a high-profile prisoner swap in August 2024 that secured the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan. In a statement following the release, Fogel&apos;s family thanked Trump for arranging the deal. &quot;We are beyond grateful, relieved and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,&quot; the statement read. While U.S. officials have not said what Russia is gaining in exchange for Fogel&apos;s release, Waltz said the deal was a sign that Trump was making progress in his attempts to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. &#xA0; &quot;President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the president&apos;s advisers negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,&quot; he said. The release of Fogel comes days after Trump claimed to have spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The Kremlin has not confirmed or denied the alleged conversations. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in December 2024, following Trump&apos;s election but before his inauguration, that Moscow would be open to participating in another prisoner exchange with the U.S. Russia has arrested many U.S. nationals since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine, with several Americans now serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. Under former President Joe Biden, the White House accused Moscow of orchestrating the arrests in hopes of future prisoner swaps for Russians held in the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-releases-imprisoned-american-teacher-in-exchange/	2025-02-11T12:53:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/prison.jpeg
Defense Ministry building testing ground for new AI-powered demining tech	The Defense Ministry is initiating the creation of a trial site to test new technologies used in demining, including those involving artificial intelligence, according to a statement published Feb. 11. Over 139,300 square kilometers of Ukrainian land are potentially contaminated with explosives from the full-scale war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion, according to the Economy Ministry. The project aims to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian demining, test innovations, and share experiences between Ukrainian and international partners, the Defense Ministry&apos;s statement read. &quot;The training ground, which is at the disposal of the Defense Ministry, can become a unique platform for joint research, testing, and training,&quot; Olha Drobot, representative of the Secretariat of the National Mine Action Authority, said. The latest technologies and their development can significantly accelerate the process of non-technical surveys of territories, improve the safety of deminers, and reduce risks to the civilian population, Drobot added. During the meeting, the participants also discussed new approaches to analyzing satellite and aerial imagery for mapping mined areas, using neural networks to automatically recognize minefields, and integrating modern artificial intelligence algorithms into safe demining. Ukraine remains the most mined country in the world. Over the past two years, Defense Ministry specialists have cleared 30,000 square kilometers of mines &#x2014; an area comparable to the size of Belgium or Moldova. Some 399 civilians have been killed, and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Multiple countries have been assisting Ukraine with demining efforts and providing training and equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-initiating-construction-of-testing-ground-for-new-demining-ai-powered-technologies/	2025-02-11T12:36:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: 'We'll swap one territory for another' — Zelensky on trade territory in potential peace talks with Russia	Key developments on Feb. 11: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to exchange territories if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, according to an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play &quot;an important part&quot; in future negotiations, Zelensky previously said. &quot;We will swap one territory for another,&quot; Zelensky told The Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. &quot;I don&apos;t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,&quot; he said. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&apos;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot; Ukrainian forces struck Russia&apos;s Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. Unverified videos posted to social media showed a large fire and search lights raking the sky reportedly in the vicinity of the refinery. &quot;The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),&quot; the General Staff said, adding that the facility supplies Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the Rosneft facility. The full extent of damage is being determined, it added. The attack was carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces, the military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, as well as other units, according to the statement. The confirmation of the attack on the Saratov oil refinery came after earlier reports of a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. The Russian Telegram news channel Shot also reported at least 11 explosions over Engels, a city lying across the Volga River from Saratov. The Russian strategic aviation airbase Engels-2, which has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian long-range strikes, lies in the vicinity. The U.S. plans to review the deployment of its troops around the world but is not going to send them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a press conference on Feb. 11. Hegseth&apos;s remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire is negotiated. &quot;We are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine,&quot; Hegseth told reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, during his visit to U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command headquarters. Hegseth added that Washington currently has no plans to reduce the U.S. contingent abroad but will review its deployment by President Donald Trump&apos;s strategic vision. The U.S. Defense Secretary also expressed hope for a swift peace agreement in Ukraine, which Trump has pledged to conclude. &quot;With hopefully a rapid peace deal in Ukraine, which the President (Donald Trump) is committed to delivering, we can then review force posture and encourage as you&apos;re going to see tomorrow (on Feb. 12) ... at the Ukraine contact group and the NATO ministerial, we&apos;re going to have straight talk with our friends,&quot; Hegseth said. Hegseth is expected to attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein summit, as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagon statement published Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to &quot;reiterate President Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,&quot; the statement read. However, this time, Hegseth is not likely to announce new military aid supplies, which was a regular occurrence during the Joe Biden administration, according to the Washington Post (WP). The Pentagon chief will not hold separate meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts but will rather be a &quot;listener&quot; at the Ramstein and at the meeting of NATO defense ministers on Feb. 13, an unnamed U.S. official told WP on condition of anonymity. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. In February, for the first time since the establishment of the Ramstein format, the meeting was convened by the U.K., not the U.S. North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea&apos;s Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia&apos;s war, confirming earlier warnings by the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-border incursion launched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia&apos;s technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support, Yonhap reported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region. Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for both Ukraine and Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade&apos;s statement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher. (The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade)Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically produced drones to front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes. It features a stationary installation with 12 radially arranged 213 mm caliber barrels and was adopted by the Soviet Navy in 1961.

As US vacates its leading role, Europe takes helm at Ramstein	The U.K. is set to gather the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Feb. 12, taking over the role the U.S. had assumed at the start of the all-out war. With U.S. President Donald Trump pulling his country out of established international agreements and formats, it&apos;s now up to European countries to fill in the gaps. &quot;Now, it will be mostly the Europeans who will determine the volume and range of weapons they are willing to provide to Ukraine,&quot; lawmaker Yehor Cherniev told the Kyiv Independent. Cherniev, who chairs Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said that European nations would likely focus on supplying their self-produced weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. &quot;The U.S. will continue to provide us with assistance, but the main burden will now be shifted to Europe,&quot; Cherniev said. &quot;The U.K.&apos;s presidency in the Ramstein format symbolizes the changes in support for Ukraine that will take place in 2025.&quot; The U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO said last week that Defense Secretary John Healey will chair the upcoming gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein meeting, in Brussels to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense priorities. Ukraine&apos;s pressing needs include bolstering the country&apos;s air defense, its deep-strike capabilities, and securing a steady ammunition supply, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to NATO Natalia Galibarenko said. &quot;We expect strong participation from our partners and look forward to hearing new pledges of military support,&quot; Galibarenko told the Kyiv Independent, saying that the three topics to be discussed at the Ramstein meeting are: &quot;the situation on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s security needs, and the pledges made by our partners and allies.&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will attend the meeting in Brussels but won&apos;t be announcing new military shipments to Ukraine. London&apos;s takeover of the meeting that gathers over 50 nations to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense needs holds &quot;a symbolic political meaning,&quot; according to lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliament&apos;s committee on foreign policy. He added that the meeting was to show that Europe would continue to support Kyiv no matter what happened in the U.S. Contrary to Cherniev&apos;s assessment, Merezhko believes that the U.S.&apos; will return to the driving seat after &quot;a transition period&quot; following Trump&apos;s return to power. &quot;I hope that they will return soon to their traditional leadership role,&quot; Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. The adjustment in the regular Ramstein meetings comes as Ukraine and Europe await Trump&apos;s next moves. Uncertainty looms over whether the Ramstein meeting would even exist under Trump. The U.S. president has claimed to have a plan to end the war in Ukraine and said he is in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 4, 2025. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Hegseth, who&apos;ll begin his European tour with the Ramstein meeting in Brussels, will stress &quot;Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible&quot; and Europe&apos;s boosting of security assistance to Kyiv, according to an official statement by the Pentagon. Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the American think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), agreed that it was already good news that Ramstein continues regardless of the change in the U.S. leadership and that Hegseth will still take part in it. Rather than waiting for Trump&apos;s presidency, Europe should have long taken over Washington&apos;s leadership role at Ramstein and suggested a rotation system of European chairs to lift the weight, Fix said. The Trump administration is demanding that European nations &quot;take over the security&quot; and assistance for Ukraine, but it should also be in Europe&apos;s interest to take the lead if it deems it as &quot;existential&quot; to its future, according to the expert. &quot;I think it was very comfortable for Europeans to rely on the U.S. leadership, and then there&apos;s also the question of who would lead Europe,&quot; Fix said, adding that &quot;it&apos;s always a competition between the U.K., France, Germany, and Poland.&quot; The downside, Fix explained, is that the U.S. is making less commitments because it won&apos;t be chairing the meeting, and the concern is how far London and Washington could push for more support for Ukraine &#x2014; and whether the latter would even try pressuring other countries. With Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, saying that the president would try to create leverage for both sides to kickstart potential peace negotiations, securing more weapons and resources has become ever more important for Kyiv. The past 25 rounds of Ramstein meetings, usually taking place at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, have helped Kyiv to receive over $145 billion in military aid from NATO countries, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. The first-ever meeting was held in April 2022 and chaired by then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was instrumental in gathering dozens of countries to discuss Ukraine&apos;s needs. The &quot;crucial platform for coordinating military aid&quot; has enabled Kyiv to receive basic resources from artillery shells, armored vehicles and tanks to modern air defense systems and U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in its January report. The February Ramstein meeting takes place at a crucial time when Ukrainian forces lose one settlement after another in the country&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast amid a critical manpower shortage. &quot;The only way a ceasefire can be achieved is through increasing leverage on Russia, and that includes continuous weapon deliveries and continuous provision of weapons to Ukraine by the Ramstein format,&quot; Fix said.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-main-burden-will-now-be-shifted-on-europe-uk-led-ramstein-meeting-to-kick-start-tomorrow-in-brussels/	2025-02-11T11:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193601148.jpg

A slipping CPI score signals Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts are stagnating	Another year has passed, and we are once again analyzing Ukraine&#x2019;s position in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). This year, Ukraine lost one point, now with 35 out of 100 possible points, ranking 105th out of 180 countries. While the loss of a single point falls within the margin of error, even this minimal change carries significance. This drop may signal stagnation in the fight against corruption, despite active legislative and governmental actions implemented last year. Ukraine&#x2019;s 2024 CPI score should serve as a wake-up call to the authorities, signaling that factors within the country are impeding progress in the fight against corruption. Overcoming these obstacles requires more than isolated declarative changes; systemic reforms in governance are essential. Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at the results of other EU-integration countries. The indicators of Georgia, Montenegro, and Turkey remained unchanged, while North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina lost two points each, and Serbia dropped by one point. Only two countries showed improvement: Moldova and Albania. The stagnation or decline observed in these countries is characteristic of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. Ukraine&#x2019;s result reflects a combination of both positive and negative developments in anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, it must be viewed through the lens of a country repelling a full-scale war imposed by a world superpower. Ukraine still outpaces Russia and Belarus, both of which lost four points each and are now ranked 154th (22 points) and 114th (33 points), respectively. This is particularly ironic, given Russia&#x2019;s previous narrative of Ukraine as a corrupt, failed state. In contrast, Ukraine has made steady progress over the past 11 years, gaining 10 points. Among Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors, only Moldova improved its score by one point, reaching 43. Romania&#x2019;s score remained the same at 46. Other countries in the region saw a decline: Poland (-1/53), Hungary (-1/41), and Slovakia (-5/49). Thus, not only Ukraine but also its neighbors showed lower results compared to last year. Despite Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war against Ukraine, Ukraine has managed to implement significant anti-corruption measures, contributing to previous improvements in the CPI. Some widely publicized events, such as notices of suspicion served to public officials or high-profile investigations, led to positive reforms. Effective collaboration between the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO), and the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) has resulted in numerous high-profile cases, including those involving former ministers, lawmakers, and the former Supreme Court chief. Over the past two years, 142 verdicts have been issued. The Verkhovna Rada expanded NABU&#x2019;s staff and strengthened SAPO&#x2019;s capacity, while launching the reform of the Accounting Chamber. Additionally, defense procurement legislation was updated, and the State Anti-Corruption Program was implemented. E-declarations and political party reporting were restored, and reforms to the Economic Security Bureau (ESBU) were initiated, along with steps to regulate plea bargaining. On the other hand, Ukraine has witnessed high-profile scandals that may have neutralized some of these achievements. Among these were the scandals involving the Ministry of Defense &#x2014; such as the eggs scandal and alleged bribery in clothing procurement for the military. Public outrage was also sparked by alleged corruption involving former Minister Vasyl Lozynskyi and interference in a tender for the reconstruction of the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital. Children walk past the offices of NABU, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Many of the scandals that caused public uproar toward the end of 2024 were not included in the CPI due to methodological reasons. However, these events reinforce negative trends in public perception of corruption and may continue to impact future results. These include scandals involving the Medical and Social Expert Commissions (MSEC), reports in Western media about Kyrylo Tymoshenko&#x2019;s role in reconstruction, and obstacles faced by a French entrepreneur in the recovery of Hostomel. The late 2024 conflict between the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Ministry of Defense (MoD) over the dismissal of the DPA head, along with the procurement of low-quality mines, further fueled public discontent. These cases may be considered in the CPI for 2025, alongside positive developments such as the launch of the Accounting Chamber reform, the announcement of an external audit for NABU, and the resumption of large-scale privatization (e.g., the sale of AEROC, formerly Russia-affiliated assets). As in previous years, the CPI scores are based on eight studies covering the period from February 2021 to September 2024. In three of these studies, Ukraine&#x2019;s score improved, while in five studies, it dropped by two to six points. Notably, in 2024, Transparency International reviewed its methodology, which means fluctuations of +/- 1 point are considered within the margin of error and reflect technical changes. However, even a slight drop in points should be treated as an early warning. Ukraine&#x2019;s 2024 CPI score suggests that progress in the fight against corruption has largely been driven by commitments made to international partners. European integration remains the key driver of reforms in Ukraine. Nevertheless, delays, a lack of political will, and attempts to preserve undue influence have hindered progress. It is crucial to remember that Ukraine is in the midst of one of the most brutal wars since World War II &#x2014; a war waged by Russia to spread autocracy, subjugate Ukrainians, and destroy our democracy. In this context, unity and support for European integration are vital. The authorities must implement necessary reforms efficiently and on time, without pushing through initiatives that may risk corruption or undermine anti-corruption efforts. Negative reactions from society should not serve as an excuse for slowing down legislative progress. Compliance with international best practices should be the default aspiration for Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine&#x2019;s position in this year&#x2019;s CPI serves as a call to action for the authorities. Delays, political maneuvering, and attempts to avoid essential changes have impacted the country&#x2019;s progress. We must not lose the gains made over the past decade. Even in the face of war and challenging circumstances, Ukraine must strive to improve, as this is the only path to preserving our statehood and securing our future.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 13	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 13 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 3&#x2013;Feb. 9, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to review High Administrative Court bill, but passage uncertain Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is set to review bill #12368-1, which proposes the establishment of the High Administrative Court, during the first plenary week of its new session. The bill, authored by Serhiy Vlasenko from the Batkivshchyna faction, faces an uphill battle, as it does not align with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) memorandum requirements and is unlikely to secure enough support for passage. Moreover, the Committee hasn&#x2019;t made a decision regarding this draft law yet. As previously reported, this version of the bill assigns jurisdiction over cases related to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) competitions and audits to the Kyiv City District Administrative Court (KMOAC). Additionally, it proposes creating a separate Kyiv City Administrative Court of Appeal for appeals &#x2014; an approach that diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the IMF&#x2019;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Meanwhile, another IMF structural benchmark, the repeal of the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; on pre-trial investigation deadlines, remains absent from the legislative agenda &#x2014; despite its original December 2024 deadline. The session&#x2019;s procedural uncertainty was further highlighted on Feb. 4, when lawmakers failed to secure enough votes to approve the 2025 parliamentary legislative plan and session agenda. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to debate ARMA reform bills This week, Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada will consider several bills aimed at reforming the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA). The agenda includes the government-backed draft law #12374, along with two alternative proposals &#x2014; draft law #12374-1, sponsored by MP Tkachenko, and draft law #12374-2, introduced by MP Oleksii Movchan. The legislative amendments is a key requirement under the Ukraine Facility plan, with a Q1 2025 deadline. The reform package seeks to enhance the appointment process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, ensuring an independent selection process, as well as introducing external audits and performance evaluations to improve accountability. Zelensky backs completion of Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant reactors Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly endorsed the completion of the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant expansion project, calling it a cornerstone of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy independence and regional stability. &#x201C;The completion of this project is key to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy independence and the region&#x2019;s energy security. It is important that Ukrainian lawmakers support this initiative,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a Feb. 4 video address. However, MPs and anti-corruption NGOs raise concerns over the financial feasibility of the project. Investigative outlet Nashi Groshi reported that Ukraine is expected to pay $1.1 billion to acquire old Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria, with additional construction and installation costs still undetermined. Six years ago, the project&#x2019;s estimated cost was Hr 80 billion ($2 billion at the time), but state nuclear operator Energoatom has now launched a tender for a revised cost assessment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-13/	2025-02-11T10:23:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-170977739.jpg
Ukrainian drones destroy Russian Smerch-2 rocket launcher in Donetsk Oblast	Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for both Ukraine and Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade&#x2019;s statement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher. (The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade)Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically produced drones to front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes. It features a stationary installation with 12 radially arranged 213 mm caliber barrels and was adopted by the Soviet Navy in 1961.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-destroy-russian-smerch-2-rocket-launcher-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-11T09:45:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-19_09_40.png
London-based digital bank Revolut officially launches in Ukraine	British fintech company Revolut officially launched its services in Ukraine after a beta testing phase, introducing a special Clear Sky debit card in Ukraine&apos;s national blue and yellow colors, the company announced on its website on Feb.11. Ukrainian residents can set up a European Revolut account and receive access to a range of services, such as instant, free transfers between app users, said the company. Revolut has been supporting Ukrainians since Russia&apos;s invasion began, offering refugees from Ukraine free access to its services, including money transfers and currency exchange, and temporarily waiving the usual requirement for proof of European residency. According to the company, over 700,000 Ukrainians residing in the U.K. and Europe already use Revolut services. Since 2022, people have sent more than 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) to Ukraine through Revolut, mainly from Germany, the U.K., Ireland, Poland, and the Netherlands. &#x201C;I am immensely proud of Revolut&#x2019;s continuous support for Ukraine. A record number of Ukrainians have joined our waiting list to be among the first to get their Revolut account,&#x201D; said Vlad Yatsenko, &#x441;o-founder and CTO of Revolut, adding that more Revolut products would be available in Ukraine soon. Ukrainian customers will be able to order virtual and physical debit cards, including the special Clear Sky VISA debit card free of charge. Users in the U.K. and Europe can get this card by donating at least five euros ($5.17) to get the card unlocked. All donations will go to the UN Refugee Agency which supports Ukrainian war refugees. Revolut announced that since Russia&apos;s invasion began, it has raised over 10 million pounds ($12.4 million) for the Red Cross Ukraine, including a 1.5 million pound ($1.9 million) company donation. Revolut was co-founded by Ukrainian Vlad Yatsenko and Russian Nikolai Storonsky, who renounced his citizenship due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company has also suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/london-based-digital-bank-revolut-officially-launches-in-ukraine/	2025-02-11T08:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-6_14_44-PM.png
US Treasury Secretary to visit Ukraine this week for talks on critical minerals deal, Bloomberg reports	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine this week to discuss a potential deal between Kyiv and Washington on critical minerals, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11, citing undisclosed sources. In recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Ukraine with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for continued support from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-treasury-secretary-to-visit-ukraine-this-week-for-talks-on-critical-minerals-deal-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-11T08:02:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197389153.jpg
Ukraine can help dismantle Russia’s influence in the Middle East	The fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has dealt a significant blow to Russia&#x2019;s ambitions in the Middle East. Yet Russia still retains influence across the region through trade, diplomacy, and military ties. Even now, Moscow maintains a presence in Syria, making it imperative for the West to capitalize on Russia&#x2019;s setback there and work to reduce its influence across the region. One way to achieve this is by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s efforts to build stronger ties in the Middle East. First, Ukraine can assist in rebuilding Syria, an effort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed willingness to undertake. While much attention is given to the future of Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria, its commercial ties to the country are equally important. The U.S. can support Ukrainian trade with Syria, starting with food. Until recently, Russia was the largest supplier of wheat to Syria &#x2014; grain largely stolen from Ukraine. However, with the fall of Assad&#x2019;s regime, these shipments have been suspended, creating an ideal opening for Kyiv. Wheat could serve as a starting point for expanded trade, alongside the development of diplomatic, cultural, and potentially military ties between the two nations. Ukrainians have already taken initial steps to build diplomatic relations with Syria, and a strengthened Ukrainian presence there could limit Russia&#x2019;s options beyond its military bases, should it manage to retain them. Second, Ukraine can assist the West in countering Russian narratives across the Middle East and Africa. Moscow&#x2019;s influence in these regions has been significant, helping explain why some Middle Eastern partners have not supported Western efforts to isolate Russia. Russian military vehicles enter the Khmeimim Air Base in Jabla, Syria, on Dec. 15, 2024. (Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images)Ukrainians themselves acknowledge their failure to invest in the region, allowing Russian propaganda to take root. In private conversations, Ukrainian officials have admitted to this misstep, but they are now taking steps to change it, including opening more embassies across the Middle East and Africa. The West can support Ukraine in these efforts, helping the region understand Ukraine&#x2019;s position. Building meaningful relationships in the Middle East has proven challenging for Ukraine, and here the West can play a crucial role. Kyiv lacks sufficient diplomats to staff its embassies, and the West can help build Ukraine&#x2019;s diplomatic capacity. Moreover, Ukrainians would benefit from Western guidance in navigating the region&#x2019;s complex cultural landscape to craft more effective messaging. Kyiv urgently needs personnel capable of engaging with the region. In addition to diplomatic and cultural training, Ukrainians could collaborate with Western governments to establish a more prominent media presence as a counterbalance to outlets like RT Arabic and Sputnik. Lastly, Ukraine can share its experience with Iran as part of its increased engagement with the Middle East, assisting Arab partners (and Israel) in countering Iranian influence. After Russia&#x2019;s use of Iranian drones in Ukraine and Iran&#x2019;s supply of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, Ukraine has gained valuable insights into dealing with Iran. These lessons could benefit audiences in the region, and the West can help shape this engagement, highlighting the similarities between Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia and Middle Eastern efforts to push back against Iran&#x2019;s malign activities. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the interconnectedness of the Middle East and European theaters. Western support for Ukraine can help Kyiv secure new revenues to fund its fight against Russia, as well as bolster its credibility in the Muslim world. A greater Ukrainian presence in the Middle East will offer multiple benefits for the West, contributing to a shift in the regional power balance in its favor and countering Russia&#x2019;s influence. Ukrainians understand that victory over Russia requires expanding their influence beyond Europe. The West has every reason to empower them in this effort in the Middle East.

Ukraine could trade territory in potential peace talks with Russia, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to exchange territories if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, according to an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play &quot;an important part&quot; in future negotiations, Zelensky previously said. &quot;We will swap one territory for another,&quot; Zelensky told The Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. &quot;I don&apos;t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-exchange-territories-in-case-trump-manages-to-get-ukraine-russia-to-negotiating-table/	2025-02-11T07:27:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Chinese refiners offered discounted Russian oil as US sanctions deter buyers, Bloomberg reports	Chinese refiners are being offered Russian ESPO crude at discounted prices as rising concerns over U.S. sanctions create logistical and administrative challenges, deterring buyers, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11. In one of his final moves in office, U.S. President Joe Biden imposed sanctions on Russia on Jan. 10, targeting Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegaz, over 180 oil tankers transporting crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, and insurance companies involved in oil logistics. Following the sanctions and rising oil prices, China temporarily halted purchases of Russian crude, despite being one of Russia&#x2019;s largest oil buyers in 2024. With the new U.S. sanctions in place, the cost of delivering Russian oil to China surged fivefold, from $1.5 million in early January to $7 million by the end of the month. This spike increased fuel and freight costs for Chinese buyers, prompting them to seek alternative suppliers in the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, Bloomberg reported. ESPO is a higher-quality Russian crude than Urals and is typically in high demand in Asian markets, where it usually trades at a premium, according to Bloomberg. Supplies of ESPO crude from the Far Eastern port of Kozmino, transported on non-sanctioned tankers and loaded in March, are selling at a $2&#x2013;$3 per barrel premium to Brent. In January, the premium for shipments under the same conditions exceeded $5. Oil delivered on sanctioned tankers is being offered at an even steeper discount. However, China&#x2019;s state-owned refiners have so far refused to sign ESPO supply contracts for February as they weigh the risks and potential consequences. Some buyers and sellers are considering using lesser-known oil terminals or unloading shipments outside Shandong province before transferring them to another tanker to keep ESPO trading. However, traders told Bloomberg this would reduce government oversight while driving up costs that most refineries cannot afford. China has strengthened economic ties with Russia since the start of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though Beijing has denied accusations of directly supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Russia&#x2019;s fossil fuel industry remains the primary economic driver of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Mounting economic pressure has nonetheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale back their dealings with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-refiners-offered-discounted-russian-oil-as-us-sanctions-deter-buyers-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-11T07:19:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Ukraine secures $58 million grant from Japan for reconstruction	The Ukrainian government approved a draft agreement with Japan to secure an 8.8 billion yen ($58 million) grant for reconstruction projects, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Feb. 11. The funds will be provided through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Shmyhal expressed gratitude for Japan&apos;s &quot;consistent, unwavering support&quot; and emphasized that Ukraine continues to work with partners to secure reconstruction resources. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Tokyo has also supported Ukraine&apos;s energy sector, which has suffered severe damage from Russian attacks, and has provided expertise on nuclear safety. In December 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Japan would allocate $3 billion to Ukraine as part of the G7 loan covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets. The World Bank estimated in February 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction may cost up to $486 billion over the next decade.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-58-million-grant-from-japan-for-rebuilding-projects-pm-shmyhal-says/	2025-02-11T06:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
US envoy in Moscow holds talks with Russian deputy FM	Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met with U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy in Moscow on Feb. 11, Russian state media outlet TASS reported without providing details on the content of the discussions. Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova later said the meeting focused on &quot;the activities of foreign institutions.&quot; According to Rybakov, diplomatic contacts between Russia and the U.S. have been kept to an absolute minimum in 2024. Relations between Moscow and Washington have sharply deteriorated since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both the Russian Embassy in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow continue to operate in limited capacities. U.S. consular services in Russia have been largely suspended since 2021 due to Moscow&apos;s restrictions on diplomatic staffing. The meeting comes as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 9 that the U.S. had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to provide details. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been in contact but did not specify whether their discussions occurred before or after his inauguration. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, American political analyst Alexandra Filippenko pointed out that Lynne and Rybakov&apos;s talks mark an unusually high-level meeting. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that the American side is making (an effort to restore ties), but the Russian side is showing an increased level of communication,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ryabkov-meets-us-envoy/	2025-02-11T06:23:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1251952759.jpg
Parliament approves controversial purchase of Russian nuclear reactors from Bulgaria	Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted in favor of buying two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on Feb. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the lawmakers last week to approve the project, calling it a &quot;key to energy independence.&quot; Bulgaria has offered to sell its unused 15-year-old VVER-1000 reactors and other equipment for units 3 and 4 of the western Ukrainian nuclear power plant as Ukraine faces regular Russian attacks against its energy grid. Some lawmakers have criticized the deal, arguing that the reactors are obsolete and expensive. The parliament has long struggled to pass the law, prompting Bulgaria to extend the deadline for concluding the deal until March. The price of the two reactors was set at $600 million, said lawmaker Andrii Zhupanyn. Nuclear power is key in sustaining Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, covering more than half of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. Russian missile and drone attacks have dealt devastating damage to Ukraine&apos;s thermal and hydroelectric generating capacity, necessitating regular emergency shutdowns. The Khmelnytskyi plant, one of the three remaining operational nuclear stations in Ukraine-held territories, is being expanded to offset the loss of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, currently under Russian occupation. The news comes as Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, who has advocated for purchasing Russian-made reactors, is under mounting political pressure. Opposition lawmakers accused the minister of &quot;systemic corruption in the energy sector,&quot; &quot;failure to protect parts of the energy infrastructure,&quot; and &quot;lies and manipulations&quot; and called for his dismissal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-approves-controversial-purchase-of-russian-nuclear-reactors-from-bulgaria/	2025-02-11T05:24:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1645854809.jpg
Ukraine’s army is reforming its structure. Will it help the fight against Russia?	As Ukraine nears the fourth year of full-scale war with Russia, it is launching a major army reform aimed at improving its efficiency and organization on the battlefield. &quot;We need the corps system,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 3, adding: &quot;Today we discussed approaches to the appointment of corps commanders: these should be the best-trained, most promising officers with combat experience and modern thinking.&quot; &quot;The army must be modern.&quot; The Ukrainian army currently operates largely under a brigade-level system. According to Zelensky, there are more than 100 brigades, each of which is subordinated to operational-tactical groups (OTU), which are subject to operational-strategic command (OSUV), and operational commands (OK). According to experts speaking to the Kyiv Independent, this has created an unwieldy management system that leads to poor coordination, as each OTU or OSUV may have dozens of brigades under its command. John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Kyiv Independent that OTUs and OSUVs are temporary bodies, so their commanders do not know their brigades as well as a permanent corps commander would. A related problem is that battalions from one brigade are often scattered across different parts of the front and attached to other brigades, undermining unit cohesion, he added. Hardie also said micromanagement is another drawback of this system, as there have been cases of interfering commanders without knowledge of a complete or up-to-date picture of the situation on the ground. Drawing on the experience of NATO partners, Ukraine plans to implement a corps system instead of a brigade one, seeking to improve cohesion. A corps is an army formation consists of several brigades rather than dozens, and includes various branches of the forces and support units. The upcoming reform will add the corps level to the army structure, which will be organizationally above the brigades. The Ukrainian military command plans to create 20 corps, Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net reported, citing undisclosed sources. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army Major-General said a corps usually has only three to seven brigades at its disposal, which allows commanders to better focus on their troops, and distributes the management load more efficiently. &quot;(The transition to the corps) will allow them just to get their arms around the brigades, have some brigades planning for operations, some brigades conducting operations, some brigades resting from operations,&quot; Ryan said.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;It will allow for more efficient employment of land combat forces and a more efficient link between the tactical and General Staff,&quot; he added. Ryan said the transition to the corps system is also part of the Ukrainian army&apos;s adaptation to NATO standards and separation from its Soviet heritage. Yet, the newly created corps could be different from those deployed by the U.K. and the U.S. during the Cold War, as there have been &quot;profound changes&quot; in technology since 1990s, he said. &quot;The West should look on with some interest because the reality is, besides the Americans, most Western military organizations are brigade-centric organizations,&quot; Ryan said. There are currently five corps in the Ukrainian Armed Forces &#x2014; the 9th, 10th, and 11th corps of the Ground Forces, the Rapid Reaction Corps in the Air Assault Forces, and the Marine Corps in the Navy. &quot;Ukraine currently has some army corps, but they&apos;re basically corps in name only. Their units are often scattered to different parts of the front line, and the corps lack many corps-echelon support units,&quot; Hardie said. &quot;Even in instances where multiple units from a corps have operated alongside one another, such as during the 2023 counteroffensive, the corps commanders didn&apos;t exercise command and control, and at any rate, the units lacked sufficient cohesion to function together as corps,&quot; Hardie added. Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent that the past performance of existing corps should be a cause for concern. Damaged cars and buildings in Kurakhove, near the front line in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;In 2023, the 9th and 10th corps failed in the offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In 2024, the 7th corps surrendered Vuhledar and then Kurakhove,&quot; he said. &quot;In 2025, we still believe that the corps (system) is a panacea for all diseases.&quot; According to Kevliuk, the change to a corps system won&apos;t address other fundamental issues with Ukraine&apos;s army, not least its critical manpower shortage, and struggles to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. He added that corps commands are likely to be formed by those who &quot;failed to manage the OTUs.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to change the command system. The main problem is to get commanders to change their management style,&quot; Kevliuk said, adding: &quot;Other problems are to make the headquarters interact horizontally and to provide the technical equipment to command.&quot; &quot;At best, the transition will have no impact. But we should expect a deterioration in the command (of the units),&quot; he concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-army-switching-to-corps-system-how-will-it-change-situation-on-battlefield/	2025-02-11T04:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190892824.jpg
With cuts looming, it's time to reform Ukraine’s humanitarian aid system	Since Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the international community has sent nearly $11 billion in humanitarian aid, with billions more from individuals, charities, and Ukrainians. The UN recently announced a new $3.3 billion appeal for 2025. Yet, despite this support, key players in humanitarian aid &#x2014; state donors, UN agencies, and International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs) &#x2014; have missed a crucial chance to reform a broken, top-heavy system. This failure is especially concerning as Ukraine faces potential cuts to international aid in the coming months and years. This is the conclusion of the latest &#x201C;Annual Localization Survey,&#x201D; conducted by Refugees International and the Ukrainian NGO East SoS. The survey, which involved 50 interviews with those who control or direct the bulk of international humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, found that UN agencies and INGOs still monopolize funding, leadership, and policy influence. Despite widespread research showing that locally led humanitarian responses are more cost-effective (between 15.5%-32%, depending on the program), efficient, and better positioned to serve people in need amid donor cuts, international organizations continue to dominate. According to FTS, less than 1% of the $11 billion in humanitarian aid sent between 2022 and 2024 went directly to Ukrainian NGOs. Unsurprisingly, cash and voucher programs, the largest type of international humanitarian intervention in Ukraine, are almost entirely managed by UN agencies and INGOs. Only 3.4% of more than $2.1 billion has been handled end-to-end by Ukrainian NGOs. Direct funding to local groups from donors is widely recognized as crucial for improving humanitarian responses. It avoids the more costly, circuitous use of international intermediaries and empowers those who know the terrain best. Additionally, it strengthens the resilience and durability of local organizations by providing them with more funding to cover overhead costs and improve long-term capacity, helping ensure they will endure after international aid declines. Even when Ukrainian organizations receive funding and in-kind goods through UN agencies and INGOs as subcontractors &#x2014; or &#x201C;implementing partners&#x201D; &#x2014; the survey found that international actors retain the majority of funding despite Ukrainian partners doing most of the actual service delivery. This is particularly true along the extensive front line. International agencies also control the design and implementation of many aid programs, even though Ukrainian responders have made clear that this impedes their empowerment and service delivery. Donors, including European states and the United States, claim they are working to empower Ukrainian organizations by funding them directly. However, progress has been hindered by two factors that no longer hold up. People receive humanitarian aid in Hostomel, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, on April 6, 2022, after it was liberated from Russian occupation amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)People receive humanitarian aid provided by volunteers in Kherson, Ukraine, on June 11, 2023, amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)First, some donors still assume that Ukrainian NGOs lack the capacity and systems to manage large grants that UN agencies and INGOs are accustomed to handling. This argument may have made sense in the early stages of the response, when many Ukrainian NGOs transitioned to humanitarian action from political and civil society programs. But as the response approaches its fourth year, data shows that a robust ecosystem of Ukrainian NGOs is handling large grants and complex requirements, well beyond the few that currently receive direct funding from major donors. Second, the perception of corruption risks among Ukrainian NGOs no longer stands up to scrutiny. Across 32 donors, INGOs, and UN agencies surveyed, which have completed hundreds of audits, no respondent pointed to any substantial, confirmed cases of corruption by Ukrainian partners. While some noted minor program irregularities, such as misunderstandings regarding budget lines, the finding is significant given the high perception of corruption in other sectors in Ukraine. Together with the cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability gains, donors should increase their support for Ukrainian responders by decisively shifting power and resources to them in 2025. This move is even more critical to mitigate the negative effects of any future cuts. The largest donors to the Ukraine response have an opportunity to embrace this improved approach, but their willingness to do so remains unclear. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has frozen most foreign aid for a 90-day review and is trying to dismantle the main U.S. aid agency. Some advocates are holding out hope, however, that Trump will eventually shift resources directly to local responders, citing the position of a leading pro-Trump think tank before the election. Regardless of what happens in the U.S., European Union states, which contribute the most humanitarian aid to Ukraine, can do much more to get funding flowing directly to Ukrainians. For instance, one leading EU state agency that cited national rules against direct funding to Ukrainian NGOs was surprised to learn from the authors that a separate agency within the same government was providing humanitarian funding directly to one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest NGOs. The EU&#x2019;s European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) arm has similarly maintained that it cannot provide funding to non-European NGOs due to an EU regulation. However, the regulation also states that an NGO&#x2019;s headquarters can be in the recipient country, which applies to Ukraine and many other countries. Ukrainian humanitarian NGOs are rapidly building coordination and oversight mechanisms, solidarity networks, and operational partnerships to take over as aid budgets shrink and international actors reduce their role. Donors, UN agencies, and INGOs are encouraging these efforts. But with drastic budget cuts looming, more than just encouragement and pilot projects are needed. Seizing this moment will have lasting implications, not only in Ukraine but for many other humanitarian emergencies around the world that are no less deserving or ready.

Russia records worst-ever ranking in key corruption index	Russia ranked 154th out of 180 countries in Transparency International&apos;s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index, marking its worst performance in the index&apos;s history, the organization reported on Feb. 11. &quot;In order for autocratic regimes to secure power, they dismantle critical checks and balances &#x2014; allowing corruption to run rampant,&quot; Transparency International said in the report. Russia was given a score of 22 points, with a lower number of points indicating higher corruption perceptions. In 2023, Transparency International placed Russia 141st with a score of 26 points. The organization highlighted that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has further entrenched authoritarianism, with the Kremlin suppressing dissent, redirecting resources to its military agenda, and eliminating independent voices. Ukraine ranked 105th with 35 points, moving up one spot from 2023 relative to other countries but losing one point. Kyiv saw a three-point increase between 2022 and 2023. &quot;Despite the Russian invasion, Ukraine is making strides in judicial independence and high-level corruption prosecutions,&quot; Transparency International said. After the EuroMaidan Revolution ousted pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, Ukraine launched an extensive anti-corruption campaign. Observers warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion presents an increasingly significant challenge to Ukraine&apos;s anti-graft reforms. Andrii Borovik, the executive director of Transparency International Ukraine, noted that while a one-point drop is not necessarily a sign of decline, it suggests stagnation and warns authorities that more reforms are needed. Tackling corruption is one of the main conditions for Ukraine&apos;s integration into Western political structures, namely the EU. Among the reforms recommended by Brussels in 2022 were changes to Ukraine&apos;s anti-corruption bodies, judiciary reforms, legislation against money laundering, and more. Among other countries in the region, Moldova improved its performance by reaching 43 points, ranking 76th, while Albania climbed five points to 80th place with 42 points. The European Union&apos;s average score dropped by two points this year to 62. Denmark topped the index for the seventh consecutive year with a score of 90, followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-records-worst-ever-ranking-in-corruption-perceptions-index-report-shows/	2025-02-11T04:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-835906084.jpg
North Korea has sent 200 long-range artillery guns to Russia, Seoul says	North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea&apos;s Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia&apos;s war, confirming earlier warnings by the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-border incursion launched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia&apos;s technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support, Yonhap reported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv&#x2019;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-sends-200-long-range-artillery-units-to-russia-seoul-says/	2025-02-11T03:58:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1911909732.jpg
US to consult allies on Ukraine peace plan, seeks Europe's arms purchases for Kyiv, media report	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has paused the development of a Ukraine peace plan to hold consultations with European allies, The Telegraph reported on Feb. 10, citing undisclosed sources. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, reportedly assured European diplomats that NATO allies would be consulted before finalizing any proposal. He also promised to engage with European heads of state on the issue, according to the outlet. The Trump administration is also exploring ways to continue arming Ukraine without significantly increasing U.S. spending, according to Reuters. One approach reportedly under discussion is encouraging European allies to purchase more American weapons for Kyiv. U.S. officials, including Kellogg, are expected to raise this issue during the Munich Security Conference this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where he is expected to meet with U.S. officials. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Kellogg will represent the Trump administration. While Bloomberg previously reported that Trump&apos;s team might unveil a peace plan in Munich, Kellogg denied this on Feb. 6. Ukraine is preparing to host Kellogg on Feb. 20 following the conference, according to sources cited by RBC-Ukraine. The Munich Security Conference comes at a critical moment for Kyiv, as Ukraine seeks to establish working relations with the new U.S. administration, which has taken a different approach to the war than its predecessor. Kellogg has described a &quot;near-term&quot; resolution as achievable within 100 days of the inauguration, calling it his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution within that timeframe.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-consult-allies-on-ukraine-peace-plan-seeks-european-weapons-purchases-media-reports/	2025-02-11T03:29:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
6 injured in Russian airstrike on Kharkiv Oblast village, including child	Russia launched an airstrike against the village of Zolochiv in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 11, injuring at least six people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A 12-year-old boy was among the injured. Three of the victims have been hospitalized, while the others were provided medical assistance on the spot, the governor said. Russian forces reportedly struck the town with guided aerial bombs at around 11:27 a.m. local time, hitting a house. The full extent of damage and casualties is being determined. Zolochiv, with a pre-war population of 7,700, lies around 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the Ukraine-Russia border and some 35 kilometers (20 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv. Kharkiv Oblast in Ukraine&apos;s northeast is a regular target of Russian missile, drone, and glide bomb attacks from across the border or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-injured-in-russian-airstrike-on-kharkiv-oblast-town/	2025-02-11T03:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1513217350.jpg
Russia concerned with weakening sway over its allies amid Western pressure, FT reports	Russian officials are concerned that the Western sanctions are undermining Russia&apos;s economic influence over countries in its close neighborhood and the Global South, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 10, citing a leaked government report. Moscow is reportedly attempting to restore its position and access to global trade by placing itself at the center of a Eurasian trade bloc that would rival the economic influence of the U.S., EU, and China. The news underscores the impact of Western sanctions on Russia and its mounting economic challenges connected to the nearly three years of the full-scale war against Ukraine. The planned initiative aims to connect Russia with the Global South through shared access to raw materials, financial and transportation links, and a unified economic policy, including a separate sanctions framework, according to the news outlet. Russia reportedly sees the project as a long-term strategy that will continue regardless of the outcome of negotiations on the war in Ukraine. The report acknowledges significant obstacles. Western pressure has hindered Moscow&apos;s efforts to integrate nations in its neighborhood, as Central Asian countries have sought to align with global markets that bypass Russia. The report also notes that Western governments have used a combination of threats and incentives to ensure compliance with sanctions. Russia&apos;s allies have exploited the situation by pushing Russian businesses out of their jurisdictions, taking control of trade flows, and demanding additional commissions to offset the risks of sanctions violations. Belarus is cited as a success story for Moscow, while Kazakhstan has distanced itself by refusing to recognize Russia&apos;s territorial claims in Ukraine and demonstrating compliance with Western sanctions. Kyrgyzstan, by contrast, has become a key route for sanctions evasion. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU has adopted 15 sanctions packages targeting Moscow&apos;s economy, while the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland have imposed similar measures to curb Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-reassert-global-trade-position-with-new-eurasian-bloc-ft-reports/	2025-02-11T02:32:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251592140.jpg
3 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 11. Overnight, Russia launched 124 Shahed-type combat and decoy drones, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones across 11 oblasts, while 64 others were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. Moscow&apos;s forces also launched up to 19 cruise, ballistic, and guided missiles from ground- and sea-based platforms, targeting gas production facilities, the report said. As a result of a missile strike on Poltava Oblast, Naftogaz facilities were damaged, and nine settlements in the Myrhorod district were left without a gas supply. Governor Filip Pronin reported no casualties. Two people were killed and six injured during Russian attacks in Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Six high-rise buildings and 12 houses were reportedly damaged. Russian forces launched heavy drone and artillery attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, injuring at least four people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Two women aged 18 and 44 were injured in the Russian shelling of Nikopol on the evening of Feb. 10, while a 67-year-old man and a 78-year-old woman were injured in Marhanets. Dozens of houses, high-rise buildings, and other buildings were damaged across the region. In Cherkasy Oblast, two men were injured by drone debris after Ukrainian air defenses shot down 17 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, Governor Ihor Taburets said. The victims have been hospitalized and are in a condition of moderate severity, according to the governor. Russian attacks injured three people in Donetsk Oblast over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said, reporting victims in Pokrovsk, Kostiantynivka, and Leontovychi. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was killed and two others were injured in Russian strikes against the Zaporizhzhia and Polohy districts, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone debris started a fire at a non-residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi city district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. A kindergarten, &#xA0;two school buildings, and other buildings were damaged elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast, but no casualties were reported, according to the regional military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-125/	2025-02-11T01:19:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-11_08-41-00.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russia's Saratov oil refinery, military confirms	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian forces struck Russia&apos;s Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. &quot;The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),&quot; the General Staff said, adding that the facility supplies Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. This comes as a confirmation of earlier reports of a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the facility. The full extent of damage is being determined.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russias-saratov-oil-refinery-military-confirms/	2025-02-11T00:56:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Saratov-Feb-11.jpeg
Trump signs 25% tariff on steel, aluminum imports; Ukraine's economy to feel the effect	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 10 imposing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions, according to the White House. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture. &quot;In recent years, we have made every effort to ensure that Ukrainian steel remains outside the 25% tariff limit in the U.S.,&quot; said First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Development Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, implying that these efforts have been unsuccessful. Svyrydenko added that the decision to impose tariffs will naturally affect Ukraine&apos;s steel industry. Trump defended the tariffs as a way to simplify duties on metals and hinted at retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on American goods. The European Commission previously vowed to &quot;react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers, and consumers from unjustified measures.&quot; The dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion of European exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting tariffs and replacing them with a quota system while the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s new tariffs threaten to reignite the trade conflict. The European Commission argued that such restrictions would disrupt the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S., raising costs and harming trade between both regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-signs-executive-order-imposing-25-tariffs-on-all-steel-aluminum-imports/	2025-02-11T00:49:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Russia strikes Ukraine's energy grid, forcing emergency shutdowns	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an aerial strike against Ukraine&apos;s power grid overnight on Feb. 11, forcing the country&apos;s energy operator to implement emergency power outages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The attack, which included strikes on gas infrastructure overnight and continued into the morning, has further strained Ukraine&apos;s energy grid. &quot;At night, Russia attacked gas infrastructure. As of this morning, the energy sector is still under attack,&quot; Halushchenko said. Russian forces reportedly launched cruise missiles from the Black Sea overnight, triggering air alerts in Kyiv and several oblasts. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since the start of its full-scale invasion, aiming to disrupt power supplies and weaken civilian morale.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-imposes-power-outages-after-russian-attack-on-energy-system-gas-infrastructure/	2025-02-10T23:12:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1247620452.jpeg
Drone strike reportedly targets Russia's key Saratov oil refinery	A drone strike targeted the Saratov oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast on Feb. 11, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. &quot;The Saratov Oil Refinery is one of the key facilities in Russia&apos;s fuel infrastructure. Its refining capacity reaches 7 million tons of oil annually,&quot; Kovalenko said, adding that the refinery is crucial in supplying fuel to the Russian military. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones struck an industrial facility in the region but did not specify whether it was the oil refinery. &quot;Operational services are working in the places where debris could have possibly fallen. According to preliminary data, there are no victims,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged aftermath of the drone attack on Saratov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 11, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko / Telegram)Russian Telegram channels reported explosions and a fire at the facility, while Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over Saratov Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Saratov, a city nearly 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, hosts multiple strategic military and industrial sites. The last known Ukrainian attack on Saratov Oblast occurred overnight on Jan. 8, igniting a large fire at an oil depot in the city of Engels, according to Russian Telegram channels.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-target-russias-key-saratov-oil-refinery/	2025-02-10T23:00:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Saratov-Feb-11.jpeg
‘Ukraine may be Russian someday,’ Trump suggests while announcing $500 billion rare earth 'agreement'	U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine may or may not lose its sovereignty to Russia, adding he wants compensation for the provided U.S. aid regardless of how the war ends, he said in an interview with Fox News published on Feb. 10. &quot;They (Ukraine) may make a deal. They may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday. But we&#x2019;re going to have all this money in (Ukraine) and I say, I want it back,&quot; Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Breit Baier. The U.S. president has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end the full-scale war nearing its third anniversary, claiming that the conflict would have never happened if he had been in office in 2022. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring the U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. &quot;I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that,&quot; the U.S. president said. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky. In the interview, Trump again claimed that the U.S. had provided more support to Ukraine than European partners, placing Washington&apos;s contribution to over $300 billion. The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed last month that less than half of that assistance arrived in Ukraine. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Despite pledges to broker a deal within 100 days, the Trump administration has provided few details on a possible peace plan. Trump&apos;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, who is set to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, is reportedly preparing several options for a ceasefire deal to be presented to the White House. Later this week, Zelensky is expected to meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference, as well as Trump in Washington, to discuss the ongoing conflict and a possible resolution. The U.S. president has also recently revealed he has been in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin after planning a face-to-face meeting, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-be-russian-someday-trump-suggests-while-announcing-500-billion-rare-earth-agreement/	2025-02-10T22:43:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197808420.jpg

Lithuania to allocate $32 million for education of Ukrainian refugees	Lithuania will allocate nearly 32 million euros ($32.9 million) in 2025 to support the education of Ukrainians who have relocated to the country due to the war, Lithuanian broadcaster LRT announced on Feb. 9. The funding will allocate 4.2 million euros ($4.3 million) to cover university tuition, grants, and scholarships. 28.7 million euros ($29.5 million) will cover education for Ukrainian children in pre-school, primary, municipal, and private schools. The funds will be designated for Ukrainians who enrolled in Lithuanian universities in 2022-2023. A decision on additional funding starting September 2025 will be made later, depending on the number of potential students. Lithuania has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine in many areas since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including through humanitarian initiatives, military aid, and diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-to-allocate-32-million-for-education-of-ukrainian-refugees/	2025-02-10T20:59:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-20_12-42-11.jpg
US Congressman proposes bill to restore lend-lease for Ukraine program	U.S. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson announced his plan to introduce the Freedom First Lend-Lease Act to Congress, on Feb. 10. Reauthorizing this program would grant U.S. President Donald Trump the authority to send Ukraine weapons through lend-lease. Wilson argued that this initiative would help deter &quot;War Criminal (Vladimir) Putin&quot; and he claimed that former U.S. President Joe Biden should have taken similar action earlier. &#x201C;Bring Russia to the table through American strength,&#x201D; Wilson wrote on X. Currently, details about the bill remain unclear, including whether it has support from other members of Congress. The $895 billion U.S. defense bill passed by Congress in Dec. 2024 did not include a provision to extend the lend-lease act for Ukraine. The U.S. passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act in May 2022, but it expired in September 2023 without ever being used. Ukrainian diplomats have been lobbying for its reintroduction as it allows the U.S. president to loan or lease arms to Ukraine while cutting through congressional red tape.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congressman-proposes-bill-to-restore-lend-lease-for-ukraine-program/	2025-02-10T19:30:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg
Russian court sentences soldier for killing 4 other servicemen, Mediazona reports	Russian Corporal Nikita Posmetukhov was sentenced to life in prison on Feb. 10 by Russian authorities for shooting four other Russian soldiers in November 2023, Mediazona reported. Russian troops have deserted or sabotaged operations as Russia presses on with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine for over three years with high casualties, using so-called &quot;meat wave&quot; tactics to gain ground. Posmetukhov was allegedly angry with a captain who imposed disciplinary measures and threatened to transfer him to an assault unit, according to a document provided Mediazona. The Southern District Military Court did not officially describe the incidents as the case proceeded behind closed doors. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the details of the incident as outlined by Mediazona. The soldier is accused of killing the patrolmen of a command bunker which Posmetukhov entered after having a drink. The accused allegedly killed Junior Sergeant Vladimir Glazyev in the bunker, according to findings by Mediazona. After the incident, Posmetukhov allegedly entered a dugout and shot Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Klyukin, Captain Mikhail Trubin, and Private Vladimir Petrichenko while they were sleeping. At the conclusion of the closed-door trial, Posmetukhov was found guilty of killing two or more people &quot;for official activities and out of hooligan motives,&quot; and charged with &quot;violent actions against military command in the context of an armed conflict&quot; under the Russian criminal code. As Russia presses on with its war against Ukraine, Russia has lost over 850,000 troops and high equipment losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-sentences-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-allegedly-shooting-4-other-soldiers/	2025-02-10T17:02:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
German authorities investigating assets of sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, Spiegel reports	Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is under investigation for undeclared assets in Germany, Spiegel reported on Feb. 8, citing the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office. Abramovich is widely known as the former owner of the Chelsea soccer club. The Russian billionaire allegedly owes up to $1.2 billion in unpaid taxes in the U.K., a media investigation has found. The EU has imposed sanctions on Abramovich, requiring the billionaire to declare his assets. If found guilty, Abramovich could face hefty fines or up to a year in prison for failing to report his assets. Luxury cars including two Bugatti Chirons, a Lamborghini Reventon, and a Mercedes CLK GTR have been frozen while authorities in Germany investigate, Spiegel reported. Several pieces of artwork have been confiscated from a villa in Bavaria that persecutors allege belong to Abramovich. The billionaire&apos;s lawyers maintain Abramovich is not the owner of the villa or the frozen luxury cars. When reached for comment by Spiegel, the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office confirmed it was investigating a &quot;58-year-old businessman from the Russian Federation&quot; under the country&apos;s Foreign Trade Act, although did not confirm directly that it was Abramovich. Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU and the U.K. following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The billionaire unsuccessfully appealed for the sanctions to be removed in 2023. Abramovich was forced to sell the Chelsea soccer club he once owned due to sanctions. U.K. lawmakers have called for assets from the sale to be spent on Ukraine aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-authorities-investigating-russian-billionaire-roman-abramovich-for-undeclared-assets/	2025-02-10T15:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-521573236.jpg
EU to review its foreign aid programs amid US decision to reform USAID	The European Union will review its multibillion-euro foreign aid program to align the distribution of funds &quot;more closely&quot; with its foreign policy interests, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 10. The EU&apos;s move coincided with the Trump administration&apos;s plans to liquidate the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Meanwhile, the European Commission is also grappling with the challenges of rising defense spending due to the war in Ukraine and views divergence with the new U.S. policies. The European Commission will update the provision of foreign aid and make it more &quot;targeted for partners,&quot; Bloomberg reported, citing the draft document. The EU seeks to restructure its foreign aid to meet its strategic interests, including strengthening alliances with like-minded countries, securing access to raw materials, and curbing the influx of migrants, according to the media. The EU&apos;s overall budget, which traditionally amounts to about 1% of the bloc&apos;s GDP, is overstretched given the wide range of demands, from the green transition to defense. In the coming weeks, the European Commission will outline ideas for improving its next seven-year budget from 2028 to 2034, Bloomberg said. Trump has targeted USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, from his first days in office. His administration has ordered a three-month freeze on nearly all international development funding and reportedly plans to lay off most of the agency&apos;s global workforce. The White House has repeatedly accused USAID of widespread waste and fraud, even though foreign aid comprises only 1% of the federal budget. The administration earlier this week placed the agency under the control of the State Department. Crews were seen on Feb. 7 removing the USAID signage from the front of the agency&apos;s headquarters in Washington. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency&apos;s programs help to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, repair critical energy infrastructure, and fund civil society initiatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-review-its-foreign-aid-programs-amid-us-decision-to-reform-usaid/	2025-02-10T14:16:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151789882.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia massing troops for new assaults in Chasiv Yar; Ukraine strikes oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai	Key developments on Feb. 10: Russian forces are gathering troops for fresh assaults in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, a spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Feb. 10. Chasiv Yar in Ukraine&apos;s east has been one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The town, located 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kramatorsk, has been under Russian attack since early 2024. &quot;Now there is a period of accumulation and concentration (of Russian forces)... on the approaches to Chasiv Yar and regrouping in the town itself for further assault operations,&quot; Zaporozhets said on national television. The spokesperson added that over the past week, Russian forces have avoided using armored vehicles, instead relying on quad bikes and buggies for logistical support. On Jan. 29, The Moscow Times reported that Chasiv Yar had fallen to Russian forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially confirmed the claim. Comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers indicate that intense fighting continues in the town. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces slowing Russia&apos;s advances through brutal street-to-street combat. Despite Russian pressure, Ukrainian defenders resist, preventing a rapid breakthrough. Drones attacked Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10, reportedly targeting the Afipskiy oil refinery, a key facility processing 6.25 million tons of oil annually, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. The refinery, located roughly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the front line, is a strategic logistics hub for diesel fuel and aviation kerosene used by Russian troops, Kovalenko said. While other Ukrainian officials have not commented on the report, the strike would align with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to disrupt Russian fuel supplies and reduce Moscow&apos;s war funding. It is not immediately clear whether the refinery suffered significant damage in the attack. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed the drone attack against the region, saying that a residential complex in Krasnodar was hit. According to the governor, downed drone debris fell on a technical superstructure of a high-rise building, causing no casualties. The Russian Telegram channel Shot, close to Russian security forces, reported that residents heard powerful explosions around 2:00 a.m. local time, with eyewitnesses noting &quot;air defense activity&quot; near the Afipskiy refinery. Kovalenko emphasized the refinery&apos;s importance, claiming it provides fuel for Russian military equipment, particularly in southern Ukraine. &quot;That is why the Afipskiy refinery is not only an industrial facility but also an important element of Russia&apos;s military infrastructure,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues, a critical source of funding for its war effort. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 9 that the United States had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to disclose details about his communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Putin had been in contact. Asked whether the conversations occurred before or after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump said: &quot;I&apos;ve had it. Let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve had it. &#xA0;And I expect to have many more conversations.&quot; The president also noted the U.S. was in contact with both Russia and Ukraine. &quot;If we are talking, I don&apos;t want to tell you about the conversations. I do believe we&apos;re making progress.&quot; Trump first revealed he had spoken to Putin during an interview with the New York Post on Feb. 8 without revealing specifics of their talk, adding only that the Russian leader &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has pushed for a swift resolution to the war, aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the administration&apos;s aim to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; Trump announced on Feb. 7 that he might meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington in the coming days and expressed interest in a meeting with Putin &quot;very quickly.&quot; Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has officially approved the domestically-produced Baton (&quot;a loaf of bread&quot; in Ukrainian) drone for use by the Armed Forces, the ministry announced on Feb. 10. The Baton drones are designed to meet military requirements for simplicity and reliability in difficult battlefield conditions. Built on frames of various sizes, they boast high-speed capabilities, allowing them to catch up with and strike targets, according to the ministry. The new drones can operate effectively in extreme weather, including freezing temperatures and intense heat, the ministry said. Ukraine has prioritized drone warfare since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, heavily investing in aerial, naval, and ground-based unmanned systems. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; an initiative to integrate drone technology further into front-line operations. Kyiv has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids, which feature turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a production target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. The Latvian Defense Ministry has ordered an unspecified number of Patria 6x6 armored personnel carriers for Ukraine, the country&apos;s ministry announced on Feb. 10. Latvia has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and pledged to annually allocates 0.25% of its GDP to provide military aid to Ukraine. The Patria 6x6 is a six-wheeled armored personnel carrier produced by the Finnish defense industry company Patria. It can carry up to 10 soldiers and be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transportation, mobile command posts and medical evacuation. Ukraine is expected to receive Patria 6x6 vehicles in late 2025. The delivery will not affect the volume and schedule of the previously placed order for the Latvian army, the statement read. &quot;We will not only support Ukraine in the fight against the occupier, but also test the use and durability of armored vehicles in real combat conditions, which will provide useful lessons for the national Armed Forces,&quot; said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. In early February, Ukrainian Ambassador to Riga Anatolii Kutsevo inspected the production of the first batch of the vehicles in the town of Valmiera. Latvia signed an agreement for the purchase of these vehicles in August 2021. The deal includes an order for more than 200 armored personnel carriers, as part of the Finnish-Latvian-Swedish-German cooperation program.

US foreign aid freeze threatens Russian war crimes investigations in Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign funding has begun to affect international efforts to hold Russia accountable for war crimes in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 10, citing eight unnamed sources and an obtained Ukrainian document. More than 140,000 Russian war crimes have been recorded by Kyiv since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. War crimes include acts such as deliberate attacks on civilians, attacks on cultural sites or medical institutions, torture, and deportations. Six U.S.-funded projects at Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, worth $89 million, are at stake, the document seen by Reuters showed. Funding for at least five of these projects has already been frozen, five sources told Reuters, citing payment disruptions. Those affected were working on issues ranging from preserving evidence from the battlefield to anti-corruption initiatives and reforming Ukraine&apos;s prosecution system. Previously, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said that several commissions involved in judicial selections have either halted work or faced operational issues due to the suspension of the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) operations. Two of the projects were funded by USAID, three by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, and one by the U.S. State Department, according to the document. A total $47 million of the funding was directly allocated to prosecute Russian war crimes, Reuters reported. Additionally, nearly 40 experts at Georgetown University&apos;s International Criminal Justice Initiative, the lead implementing organization of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine (ACA), stopped working, two sources told the news agency. ACA is an international initiative funded by the U.S., U.K. and EU that have provided expertise and oversight to Ukrainian authorities. It has sent more than 150 experienced experts to help Ukrainian prosecutors. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Trump&apos;s administration is reportedly planning to eliminate most positions at USAID, The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Billionaire Elon Musk, now head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump agreed to shut it down.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-foreign-aid-freeze-threatens-russian-war-crimes-investigatin-in-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-02-10T14:00:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1243622325.jpg
Russian soldiers wounded in war in Ukraine receive treatment, rehabilitation in North Korea, ambassador says	Russian soldiers wounded in the war in Ukraine undergo treatment and rehabilitation in North Korea, Alexander Matsegora, Russia&apos;s ambassador to North Korea, said in an interview with the Russian state-controlled media outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta published on Feb. 9. North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past three years, particularly in the context of geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. In the fall of 2024, Russia and North Korea ratified a strategic partnership agreement which includes the development of trade, scientific, technical, and defense cooperation. However, the agreement did not mention the treatment of wounded Russian soldiers. Treatment for the Russian military in North Korea is provided free of charge in &quot;the best hospitals and sanatoriums,&quot; Matsegora said. The ambassador added that &quot;hundreds&quot; of wounded had been sent to North Korea. &quot;When we offered to compensate our (North Korean) friends for at least part of their expenses, they were sincerely offended and asked us never to do it again,&quot; Matsegora said. According to Matsegora, the children of Russian service members killed in Ukraine are vacationing in North Korea, and the two countries are developing university student exchanges. The ambassador added that Russia also supplies North Korea with coal, food, and medicine. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014; including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014; to sending soldiers. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian troops in countering a Ukrainian incursion in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-wounded-in-war-in-ukraine-receive-treatment-rehabilitation-in-north-korea-ambassador-says/	2025-02-10T13:35:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241864963-16583266909s1o2.jpg
Ukraine considering offering high annual salary, free education, interest-free mortgage rates for young volunteer fighters, media reports	The Ukrainian military&apos;s &quot;special contracts&quot; for recruited volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, will reportedly include a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, as well free higher education, Ukrinform reported on Feb. 10. &quot;In the coming days, all details will be official,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky was reportedly overheard saying to Nadia Calvino, the president of the European Investment Bank, during her visit to Kyiv, according to Ukrinform. The reported remarks come after Zelensky revealed in an interview with Reuters on Feb. 8 that the military is planning to introduce the so-called &quot;special contracts.&quot; The move follows reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The details of the contracts, which Zelensky said will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; would be made public in the coming days. &quot;A person will be able to earn one million hryvnias in a year. In addition, young people who serve for a year in the war will be able to choose a higher education institution and study for free without any exams &#x2014; the state will cover all costs,&quot; Ukrinform quoted Zelensky as saying. &quot;I would also highlight the special mortgage conditions &#x2014; 0% interest, with the state covering all payments.&quot; The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considering-uah-1-million-salary-free-education-preferred-mortgage-rates-for-young-volunteer-fighters-media-reports/	2025-02-10T13:17:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-01-at-12.29.54b.jpg
Ukraine's stocks hit pre-war levels on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, Polish media reports	WIG Ukraine, Ukrainian companies&apos; stock price index on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), rose by almost 25% in a few days, reaching pre-war levels, Polish media outlet Puls Biznesu reported. Financial markets have reacted positively to the U.S. government&apos;s promises to present a plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war soon. Following Donald Trump&apos;s win in the elections, Ukraine&apos;s sovereign bonds rose in price as investors expect a quicker end to the war. Trump and his team say they have made progress in efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with Trump recently telling reporters he has been in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since taking office in January, his administration has pushed for a quick resolution, aiming for a deal within the first 100 days. Investors expect to see the recovery of Ukraine-controlled territories and negotiations on the country&apos;s accession to the EU to follow, creating opportunities for Ukrainian and Polish companies listed on the WSE, Jakub Szkopek, an analyst at investment company Erste Securities told Puls Biznesu. &#x201C;This is especially true for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials with experience in the Ukrainian market. Such (Polish) companies include Grupa Kety, whose liquidity makes it easier for foreign investors to buy shares. The situation is similar with Budimex,&#x201D; said Szkopek. The analyst added that the Ukrainian equity index&apos;s growth positively impacted the stock prices of the largest Polish companies. The WIG Ukraine index, which tracks the financial returns of WSE-listed Ukrainian companies, includes the largest agricultural holdings, such as Kernel, Astarta, Ovostar, and IMC.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-stocks-hit-pre-war-levels-on-the-warsaw-stock-exchange-polish-media-reports/	2025-02-10T11:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198207826.jpg
Trump's team to visit Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Representatives of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team are visiting Ukraine this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 10 during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukrinform reported. Zelensky announced on Feb. 4 that the Ukrainian government was &quot;finalizing details&quot; for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Trump&apos;s return to the White House. Yet the president did not specify who exactly would be part of the delegation. &quot;There will be some (high-profile) people from President Trump&apos;s team here in Ukraine this week, even before the Munich Security Conference. Then there will be the conference, and I will have several meetings there, including with the U.S. Vice President (J.D. Vance),&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that it is necessary to focus on joint work between the Ukrainian and U.S. teams. &quot;Of course, there may be different opinions, but (there must be) a common vision of the main things: how to stop (Vladimir) Putin and how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The Presidential Office also said previously that Ukraine is preparing to host Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&apos;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-to-visit-ukraine-this-week-zelensky-says/	2025-02-10T10:47:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
Kellogg 'preparing options' for ending war in Ukraine to present to Trump, media reports	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is still &quot;preparing options&quot; for ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine to present them to the president later, Semafor reported on Feb. 10, citing three Western officials familiar with the talks. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has been aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. Yet, Trump&apos;s team has not revealed how it plans to end the Russian invasion and announced that it will not present its plan at the Munich Security Conference on February 14-16. Kellogg said that the proposals are still in development during one meeting with U.S. allies, according to Semafor. The envoy also noted that he is eager to meet and coordinate with all officials of each NATO country. Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war, which would involve &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering incentives to both sides. Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing providing access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing. Trump&apos;s special envoy is also expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-preparing-options-for-ending-war-in-ukraine-to-present-to-trump-media-reports/	2025-02-10T10:39:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Negotiations are dictated on the battlefield' — Polish envoy on Russia-Ukraine war	Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. Poland holds a special position among Kyiv&apos;s partners &#x2014; with a shared history of Russian oppression and conquest, its leaders have left no room for doubt that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine represented an existential threat to the region and Europe as a whole. Poland has sent tanks, fighter jets, artillery, and more to boost Ukrainian defenders fighting Russian forces, while the country has opened its doors to nearly 2 million Ukrainian refugees since 2022. Yet Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia has also been marked by tensions, sparked both by historical grievances and modern political and economic factors. The ongoing dispute centered on the World War II-era Volyn massacres by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army of Poles living in what is today western Ukraine and subsequent reprisals. And economic disputes, such as protests by Polish farmers against Ukrainian grain, further complicate ties as Kyiv seeks entry to the EU and the single European market. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Poland&apos;s charge d&apos;affaires in Kyiv, Piotr Lukasiewicz, on Jan. 29 to discuss why Poland stands out among Ukraine&apos;s partners, how to approach the most painful chapters of the shared Polish-Ukrainian history, and why it may be too early to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Since the outbreak of the first invasion, Poland has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine. How has Poland been irreplaceable as an ally? Piotr Lukasiewicz: Four hundred tanks, several hundred APCs (armored personnel carriers), including the modern ones, artillery, spare parts, hundreds of tons of ammunition, thousands of tons of humanitarian and other equipment, military and civilian. The Kyiv Independent: How can we reconcile the fact that Ukraine and Poland have been close allies but also had many heated disputes, even emotional exchanges between Polish and Ukrainian leaders, during the war? Piotr Lukasiewicz: Since we are neighbors, we have our good times and bad times. And such close nations have these ebbs and flows of relations and attitudes. The strategic message from us is that we are here to support Ukraine rather than go back to political and historical discussions from the past. Of course, they are very important to the identity of Ukrainians and Poles. And they have to be somehow resolved, which is happening. The resolution of these disputes is happening as we speak, and I&apos;m happy to report progress on both sides, progress in terms of attitude. People are expecting some form of breakthrough, some form of symbolic act of reconciliation. But these very rarely happen between the nations of Europe. It is a period of reconciliation, rather than an act of reconciliation. It is progress that we call the European Union.

(Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Are you worried that these underlying issues, such as historical and economic disputes, could undermine Poland&apos;s military and security support for Ukraine or, as you call it, this strategic interest? Piotr Lukasiewicz: When historians and specialists gather in Lviv, Kyiv, Warsaw, and Krakow, when Polish leaders come to Ukraine, or Ukrainian leaders go to Poland, and even touch upon the question of history and the troubles from the past, almost in the same sentence they say that if we argue, if we have this heated discussion that prevents us from doing something more, the only one who benefits is Russia. Russia is using its hybrid, information, and malicious influence, both here in Ukraine and Poland, to use this debate to its own benefit. If we turn it into something political, only Russia would benefit. We can always argue about this place or another place, about this number of people killed here, the number of people killed there. This is a matter for serious discussion, and it&apos;s happening. The Kyiv Independent: Just to clarify, we&apos;re talking about Volyn massacres and the victims&apos; exhumations (in Ukraine). Piotr Lukasiewicz: We are talking about the victims, yes. The Kyiv Independent: You spoke against politicizing the Volyn massacres. How would you respond to voices in Ukraine who say that Poland itself is politicizing the issue by linking it to Ukraine&apos;s efforts to join the EU? Several politicians have said that Ukraine will not be able to join the EU unless the Volyn issue is settled. Piotr Lukasiewicz: So there are narratives on both sides. But there are facts on the ground that are moving this process towards a good resolution. What else can I say? Of course, I won&apos;t comment on this politician or another to say whether (what they have said) is true or not. The second thing is that EU accession talks are not conditioned on individual bilateral relations between countries with the candidate states. This applies not only to Ukraine but also to Moldova, the western Balkans, and others. It is merit-based. The European Union is a collection of national interests. So, we are conducting these negotiations with Ukraine with our national interests in mind. But it&apos;s very important to understand &#x2014; for Ukrainians especially &#x2014; that the process is not a Polish-Ukrainian one. It&apos;s a process (involving) all member states. President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda commemorate the victims of the Volyn Massacre in the Ukrainian city of Lutsk on July 9, 2023. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent: There are still many historical topics that are viewed very differently in Poland and Ukraine, such as Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or its commander, Roman Shukhevych. Do you expect that these topics will continue to strain Polish-Ukrainian relations and hinder Ukraine&apos;s effort to join the EU? Piotr Lukasiewicz: As is mentioned in many books, including (Timothy) Snyder&apos;s Bloodlands, Polish and Ukrainian history is full of blood, tragedy, and crimes committed against each other. You mentioned names that sound tragic in Polish history and our understanding of our identity. We are not going to pay respect to these names, but we can&apos;t really influence what Ukrainians think. We are not going to choose heroes for neighboring nations. But it&apos;s very important for me and the Polish people, Polish historians, and Polish politicians that what is happening now, in the last 12 years of the Ukrainian struggle against the Russian empire, is that these times are producing greater, better, more suitable heroes for Ukrainian identity. If you look at our embassy here in Kyiv, you will notice the pictures of Ukrainian soldiers with Polish roots. These are Poles living here in Ukraine who resisted the Russian invasion during the last 12 years. For me, these are true heroes. I can relate to, and understand them. I&apos;m Polish, they were Polish-Ukrainian. I&apos;m not advising Ukrainians to build their history only on them. But their examples, their beautiful faces, which are shown at our embassy&#x2026; there you can say: &quot;These are the heroes that we can build our friendly relations upon.&quot; These are the people who are fighting for modern Ukraine, not for Ukraine as it was 100 or 70 years ago. They are future-oriented heroes rather than heroes who wrote many, many ugly things in the past. If Ukrainian society is trying to understand or is searching for a national example in history, it should also look at what happened between Poles and Germans, between French and Germans, and between many nations and how they reconciled. This was based on European values of reconciliation &#x2014; European Union values. This should be future-oriented rather than expressing the sole identity of a particular nation. Russia is not threatening only Ukraine, or only Polish independence, or Latvian, Lithuanian, or Estonian independence. They are collectively threatening Europe as a whole rather than our own particular, individual identity. The Kyiv Independent: Poland took over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU this January with the promise to help Ukraine speed up the accession process. What steps can Poland take in this regard? Piotr Lukasiewicz: First, you should remember that the presidency of the EU Council is not what it used to be. It is a management rather than a leadership position. But what we can do is that we can speed up the discussion. For instance, the opening of so-called clusters or chapters of negotiations is a process of three or four steps &#x2014; accepting the screening report, issuing the benchmarks, and then starting negotiations. So there are three or four steps that we can speed up during these six months, to maintain the Ukrainian agenda at the highest possible level, conduct very professional, merit-based, but still fast negotiations. And we are seeing great will from the Ukrainian side to speed up this process. We are working to achieve the unanimity of the votes among the representatives of the member states in Brussels. And we are quite optimistic in delivering this first chapter, the so-called fundamentals, in the next two or three months. Second, Poland had its own history of accession. We are very similar to Ukraine in terms of size, demographics, and type of economy. During our presidency, we want to share the best experiences, practices, and lessons learned by Polish negotiators. The Kyiv Independent: What do you see as the main obstacles to Ukraine&apos;s EU accession efforts? Piotr Lukasiewicz: It&apos;s the particular interests of the member states that can be driven by individual interests rather than strategic interests in mind. The strategic interest of the EU as a whole is Ukraine as a free and democratic member in, hopefully, the best and fastest possible way. The Kyiv Independent: But looking from the perspective of Poland specifically, are you, for example, worried about accepting Ukraine into a single European market? We saw the mass protests and border blockades that came as a result of Ukrainian agricultural imports. Piotr Lukasiewicz: You are asking about Poland&apos;s particular interest, which I&apos;m trying to put into a different perspective. It&apos;s a collective negotiation of all member states rather than just Poland and Ukraine. When we were entering the European market, we had this period of delay in particular sectors of the economy. In the first period of our membership, the farmers were paid both by the EU and our government. I remember very well the Polish lessons, a kind of disillusionment when several member states in 2000, 2002, and 2003 were voicing the same thing you asked &#x2014; how the Polish accession to Europe would change the agricultural market further west in France or Spain? Every nation has its own agricultural or economic interests. This is the experience we should pass on to Ukrainians so they can understand how they have to adapt to the common market, and how they have to change their structure, transportation policy, and agricultural infrastructure. What we are trying to do for Ukraine is help them understand that it&apos;s not Poland that is particularly blocking something. It&apos;s a collection of the national interests of other member states as well. We also have to adapt to this changing market. But the Polish example is that since we joined the European market with all the obstacles I mentioned, our GDP has grown almost by 300%. After 20 years, we are three times richer than we were when we entered. This is an example that Ukrainians should consider. It is not a threat to them or to us. It&apos;s rather a question of adapting to new economic realities. The Kyiv Independent: With the start of the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, there are expectations that Europe should take greater responsibility for helping Ukraine resist Russian aggression and for ensuring the security of Europe as a whole. What role can Poland, as one of the most powerful militaries on the continent, play in this regard? Piotr Lukasiewicz: I&apos;m in a very privileged position among the ambassadors here in Kyiv to say that we are actually answering the calls to spend much more on defense. Everywhere you go, Poland is being given as an example of how to spend, what to spend, and how much to spend on defense. Of course, we cannot sit back and say: &quot;Okay, we achieved 5% (of GDP on defense spending), we are done.&quot; So we are calling on other nations that are lagging behind with this expenditure. Secondly, given the importance of the Polish geographical position vis-a-vis Ukraine, we notice a much greater interest from our Central European and Nordic allies to gather around the example of Poland and the necessity to work together. I&apos;m talking about these northern formats organized by the Polish government this year. The second format is the so-called Weimar Plus with France, Germany, and Poland being the core. And plus several other nations, the so-called big European five. The Kyiv Independent: One hotly debated subject recently was the possibility of deploying European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire deal in Ukraine. What is Poland&apos;s position toward this idea? Piotr Lukasiewicz: A very clear position. There is no description of such a mission. There is no definition of such a mission. If there is a ceasefire, hopefully with the best Ukrainian position, then we will talk about a future peacekeeping contingent or not. It very much depends on what will be achieved on the front lines. We are focusing right now not on discussing possible scenarios of the future, but rather on how to support Ukraine here and now.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe a successful and strong ceasefire deal? Piotr Lukasiewicz: A ceasefire can take many forms. Over the past 12 years, we have observed how the ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine looked, how it was immediately broken by Russia after the first phase of the war in 2014, and how Russia committed itself to gradually invading more and more. It is a rather baseless discussion right now about what (the ceasefire) would look like. What we have now is a heroic defense of Ukraine with the capabilities they have, which we are trying to strengthen. It is the basic knowledge that peace negotiations should be conducted from a position of strength. And we are helping Ukraine to achieve the best achievable position in these future talks. The second thing is that we cannot adopt the kind of mental position that Russia is enforcing something. We should be speaking from a position of strength &#x2014; we are 10 times bigger in the sense of military, economy, and many advantages Europe has over Russia. It is us who should be imposing our conditions on Russia and imposing our threats on the Russian economy. The Kyiv Independent: What should be non-negotiable in possible talks with Russia? For example, Russia recently declared that it will insist on barring Ukraine from entering NATO. Piotr Lukasiewicz: The negotiations are dictated by the battlefield. This is war, not a political process. And the war changes a lot on a monthly basis. So we should not talk about the politics of how we should communicate with Russia, but rather achieve a reality on the ground that would serve political and diplomatic messages, with Ukraine being a leader or an actor in it. Putin wants&#x2026; to have one partner, one of the big global powers, so he can be again seen as a global leader. And we are in the same basket with the Ukrainians, the Czechs, the Germans, and others being talked over our heads, about our agency, existence, and well-being. So, the basic condition for us, as for many Europeans, is strengthening Ukraine and then being part of the scenario or architecture in the future. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

As US cuts Ukraine funding, EU's lending arm steps in with nearly 1 billion euros in investments	The European Union&apos;s lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB), has signed agreements to mobilize close to 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) in investments into Ukraine&#x2019;s public and private sectors as the U.S. moves to cut funding to development projects in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s decision to freeze all foreign assistance has cast uncertainty on the future of projects in Ukraine in nearly every sector, from critical infrastructure to civil society development. Nadia Calvino, the EIB&apos;s president, said at a press briefing on Feb. 10 that she had discussed Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent funding needs with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to see where the bank could fill the gaps if international partners withdraw their support. &quot;We discussed the priority areas where the EIB could step up its support &#x2014; for example, in the areas of border management, transport, energy, and municipalities,&quot; Calvino said in Kyiv during her first visit to the country since taking up office as head of the EIB a year ago. &quot;We&#x2019;re working very closely with the government to finance the necessary investments to rebuild, repair, and make national infrastructure more resilient,&quot; she said. The investment announced on Feb. 10 includes 420 million euros ($433 million) in Ukraine&#x2019;s public sector to help restore critical infrastructure such as energy, heating, water supply, hospitals, schools, and social housing. On the private sector side, the bank has signed an agreement to mobilize close to 500 million euros ($515 million) in financing for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the whole country, including in front-line regions, Calvino said. The bank also announced the German Economy Ministry is providing a 16.5-million-euro ($17 million) loan through the EIB&#x2019;s climate initiative fund to finance renewable energy projects in Ukraine. &#xA0;The EIB is a key lender in funding Europe&#x2019;s green transition. Calvino said the EIB has been working with the Ukrainian government to speed up the implementation of projects on the ground over the last year. The bank signed a pledge with Ukraine&apos;s government last year to accelerate the deployment of 560 million euros ($596 million) it had ready to help rebuild Ukraine in 2024. &#xA0; &quot;Municipalities and small and medium-sized businesses can start already approaching their banks to see about this financing and we hope that it will be mobilized as soon as possible,&quot; she said at the press briefing. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the EIB has delivered over 2.2 billion euros ($2.26 billion) in financing mainly dedicated to repairing and modernizing Ukraine&#x2019;s municipal infrastructure. This latest round of investment announcements are part of the bank&#x2019;s 2-billion-euro ($2.06 billion) contribution to the EU&#x2019;s 50-billion-euro ($51 billion) Ukraine Facility loan and grant program. As Trump&#x2019;s team looks to negotiate an end to Russia&#x2019;s nearly-three year full-scale invasion of Ukraine, talks of reconstruction in Ukraine have returned to front and center. Russia&#x2019;s constant missile and drone attacks since 2022 have seriously damaged Ukraine&#x2019;s housing, water and energy systems. Costs to rebuild are approaching the $500 billion mark. Calvino said she is sure the EIB will play an important role in supporting the reconstruction of the country &quot;not only because of our direct investment but because of our ability to mobilize public and private investment to support the public and private sector in Ukraine, and beyond.&quot; Meanwhile, European member states recently called on the EIB to increase its lending to the bloc&#x2019;s defense industry and beef up its defenses against any possible Russian attack in the future. &#xA0; The president said she welcomes the support the bank has received from European membes states on stepping up the EIB&#x2019;s role in supporting Europe&#x2019;s defense and security sectors &quot;while safeguarding our financing capacity and AAA rating.&quot; The bank already invested 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) into the sector last year and plans to double it to 2 billion euros ($2.06 billion) in 2025, she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-us-cuts-ukraine-funding-eus-lending-arm-steps-in-with-nearly-1-billion-euros-in-investments/	2025-02-10T09:03:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196077958.jpg
Russian man admits to killing two war-wounded Ukrainian soldiers in Germany	A Russian national accused of killing two war-wounded Ukrainian soldiers aged 23 and 36, has admitted to the crime in a German court, Deutsche Welle reported on Feb. 10. In April 2024, the suspect and two Ukrainian soldiers who were undergoing rehabilitation in Murnau, Germany, were drinking together in a bar, according to investigators. As a result of an argument about the Russian war in Ukraine, the Russian allegedly stabbed the two men. &quot;Now, in a sober state, I deeply regret what happened,&quot; the 58-year-old suspect said at the start of his trial. Due to the argument, the Russian citizen felt &quot;violated in his national pride,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Central Office for Combating Extremism and Terrorism of the Munich Public Prosecutor. The suspect has been living in Germany since the early 1990s and is a &quot;supporter of an exaggerated Russian nationalism&quot; who &quot;unreservedly advocates the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; according to the indictment. On April 27, 2024, the two Ukrainians were found with stab wounds in a shopping center in Murnau. The 36-year-old man died from severe injuries at the scene, while the 23-year-old died in hospital the same evening. The suspect was also detained on April 27. The investigation did not rule out political motives for the crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-suspected-of-killing-two-war-wounded-ukrainian-soldiers-in-germany-pleads-guilty-in-court/	2025-02-10T08:49:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2150546515.jpg
The Baltic Sea’s energy infrastructure is under attack. NATO must act	The European Union and NATO must strengthen cooperation to protect critical energy infrastructure from attacks, which pose a growing threat to European stability. The Kremlin, with its history of weaponizing energy, remains a prime suspect. NATO must properly secure the Baltic Sea &#x2014; the so-called NATO lake. The Baltic states achieved independence from the post-Soviet energy system in February by connecting to the continental grid via Poland. However, this transition is being overshadowed by a series of incidents in the Baltic Sea, underscoring the urgent need to secure the energy bridge from Poland, known as the LitPol Link. Poland and the Baltic states are ramping up their preparations. Energy ministers from the Baltic states and Poland discussed preparations on Jan. 24 for the synchronization scheduled for Feb. 8-9. They announced plans for joint protection of the infrastructure required for this effort, following multiple incidents in the Baltic Sea. The synchronization will proceed without relying on the Estlink 2 cable, which was damaged in one of these incidents. The meeting in Riga focused on finalizing preparations for synchronization and strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure. &#x201C;The damage to the Estlink 2 power cable connecting Finland to Estonia has not impacted the ability of the Baltic states to safely disconnect from the Belarusian and Russian energy system and connect to the European grid,&#x201D; the ministers concluded. Analyses indicate that the Baltic states have sufficient cross-border capacity through Estlink 1, NordBalt, and LitPol Link to synchronize with Europe without relying on Estlink 2. Synchronization entails disconnecting the Baltic states from the post-Soviet BRELL system &#x2014; which will continue to include Belarus and Russia &#x2014; and adapting Baltic energy systems to operate on the continental frequency. The LitPol Link power connection, running through Poland, will facilitate this transition. Synchronizing with the continental grid will eliminate energy exchanges with the BRELL system. This move is particularly significant for Kaliningrad Oblast, which will become an energy island &#x2014; just as the Baltic states would have been if disconnected from BRELL without European synchronization. However, we cannot be sure that other parts of the critical infrastructure needed for a successful disconnection from the post-Soviet system are safe from malign activity. The Baltic states and Poland are enhancing the security of LitPol Link and other critical infrastructure elements to protect the synchronization process. &#x201C;The resilience and protection of infrastructure have never been more important. The Russian Federation is deliberately destroying Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid, and its hybrid activities in the Baltic Sea underscore the importance of a well-secured energy system for defense,&#x201D; said Krzysztof Bolesta, state secretary at Poland&#x2019;s Ministry of Climate and Environment.

(Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images)Poland is also taking lessons from another energy bridge to Lithuania, known as Harmony Link. Rising costs and security considerations led Polish and Lithuanian operators to plan Harmony Link as a subsoil cable instead of the originally proposed sea route. Land-based infrastructure is easier to secure and &#x2014; more importantly &#x2014; can be repaired faster. If sabotage damage can be repaired within a few weeks, the act of sabotage loses much of its impact. That is why the news that Finnish telecom company Elisa managed to repair two undersea cables in about two weeks was so encouraging. Another type of threat is emerging as well. Baltic operators have reported the spread of disinformation regarding the synchronization of their energy systems with Europe. &#x201C;We urge the public to critically evaluate information, resist emotional opinions, and refrain from spreading unverified reports,&#x201D; participants of the Riga meeting emphasized. Beyond spreading fear, the enemy may be attempting to promote a false economic narrative &#x2014; that disconnection from BRELL would significantly increase electricity costs. That narrative is false. According to a study conducted during the preparations, the average increase in energy prices for consumers with an average consumption of 140 kWh per month would be minimal: 50 cents per month in Lithuania, 60 cents in Estonia, and around one euro in Latvia. Relatively speaking, this is not a heavy impact. In return, the Baltic states gain energy independence from the Russian operator and market coupling with Europe, which promotes price decreases. Energy system operators in Poland and the Baltic states have been instructed by their governments to implement an urgent package of measures to enhance the security of critical energy infrastructure. Lithuania&#x2019;s Interior Ministry expedited the strengthening of the LitPol Link cable&#x2019;s protection, advancing the timeline from April to Jan. 15 in response to the severing of the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia on Dec. 26, 2024. Poland is also taking action. &#x201C;Polish Transmission System Operator (PSE) ensures the protection of transmission infrastructure within the Republic of Poland&#x2019;s territory. The company collaborates with relevant national services and institutions, as well as transmission system operators in neighboring countries,&#x201D; PSE stated in a comment for the Energy Drink podcast. &#x201C;Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, a state of heightened readiness has been in place, and the infrastructure is continuously monitored, with particular attention given to interconnections with Lithuania, Sweden, and Ukraine. New measures to enhance physical security are also being implemented.&#x201D; (L-R) Henna Virkkunen, Mette Frederiksen, Ulf Kristersson, Gitanas Naus&#x117;da, Alexander Stubb, Mark Rutte, Kristen Michal, Edgars Rink&#x113;vi&#x10D;s, Olaf Scholz, and Donald Tusk pose at the Baltic Sea NATO summit in Helsinki, Finland, on Jan. 14, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva/AFP via Getty Images)PSE reports ongoing collaboration with operators in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to strengthen regional infrastructure protection. &#x201C;Discussions are underway about launching joint projects in this area and securing EU funding for them,&#x201D; the statement adds. The increasing frequency of attacks on critical infrastructure &#x2014; such as the recent incident involving the undersea cable between Latvia and Gotland &#x2014; highlights the difficulty of attributing blame in a complex and interconnected world. Scandinavian media reports suggest it could have been an accident. However, there have been too many such &#x201C;accidents&#x201D; since Russia&#x2019;s unlawful aggression against Ukraine began. The West needs to take the initiative and stop retreating. The EU and NATO must develop new tools and strategies to address these challenges and protect collective security &#x2014; especially in the Baltic Sea, which must be properly secured as a NATO-controlled waterway.

NABU confirms 'pre-trial investigation' of Defense Minister Umerov over potential abuse of power	Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has confirmed it is investigating possible abuses of power by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, the agency&apos;s director Semen Kryvonos said at a press conference on Feb. 10. A &quot;pre-trial investigation&quot; was launched after Umerov dismissed Marina Bezrukova from her post as director of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and appointed Arsen Zhumadilov in her place, prompting the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) to file a complaint with NABU. &quot;The pre-trial investigation is ongoing, and all the circumstances are being determined &#x2014; whether there is a crime or not, whether there are perpetrators or not,&quot; Kryvonos said. &quot;I would not say that criminal proceedings have been initiated against anyone. It was initiated based on a complaint about possible abuses,&quot; he added. NABU launched the pre-trial investigation on Jan. 28. The dismissal of Bezrukova followed a week of escalating tensions between the ministry and the DPA. On Jan. 21, the DPA supervisory board voted unanimously to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. But due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Zhumadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are unlawful. ANTAC accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment. Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025. Umerov also dismissed two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the situation on Feb. 2, saying that the defense minister has the right to do everything to ensure that supplies do not slow down. According to Ukrainian law, if officials have abused their power or position in a manner leading to &quot;serious consequences,&quot; they are punishable by imprisonment for three to six years and disqualified from holding certain positions or engaging in certain activities for up to three years.	https://kyivindependent.com/pre-trial-investigation-ongoing-national-anti-corruption-bureau-looking-into-umerovs-potential-abuse-of-power-office-position/	2025-02-10T08:00:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648104571.jpg
Ukraine to receive Patria 6x6 armored vehicles from Latvia this year	The Latvian Defense Ministry has ordered an unspecified number of Patria 6x6 armored personnel carriers for Ukraine, the country&apos;s ministry announced on Feb. 10. Latvia has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and pledged to annually allocates 0.25% of its GDP to provide military aid to Ukraine. The Patria 6x6 is a six-wheeled armored personnel carrier produced by the Finnish defense industry company Patria. It can carry up to 10 soldiers and be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transportation, mobile command posts and medical evacuation. Ukraine is expected to receive Patria 6x6 vehicles in late 2025. The delivery will not affect the volume and schedule of the previously placed order for the Latvian army, the statement read. &quot;We will not only support Ukraine in the fight against the occupier, but also test the use and durability of armored vehicles in real combat conditions, which will provide useful lessons for the national Armed Forces,&quot; said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. In early February, Ukrainian Ambassador to Riga Anatolii Kutsevo inspected the production of the first batch of the vehicles in the town of Valmiera. Latvia signed an agreement for the purchase of these vehicles in August 2021. The deal includes an order for more than 200 armored personnel carriers, as part of the Finnish-Latvian-Swedish-German cooperation program.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-patria-6x6-armored-vehicles-from-latvia-by-2025-ministry-says/	2025-02-10T06:42:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GjbD8SLX0AA3_Qz.jpg
Ukraine approves high-speed Baton drones for battlefield deployment	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has officially approved the domestically-produced Baton (&quot;a loaf of bread&quot; in Ukrainian) drone for use by the Armed Forces, the ministry announced on Feb. 10. The Baton drones are designed to meet military requirements for simplicity and reliability in difficult battlefield conditions. Built on frames of various sizes, they boast high-speed capabilities, allowing them to catch up with and strike targets. The new drones can operate effectively in extreme weather, including freezing temperatures and intense heat, the ministry said. Ukraine has prioritized drone warfare since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, heavily investing in aerial, naval, and ground-based unmanned systems. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; an initiative to integrate drone technology further into front-line operations. Kyiv has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids, which feature turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a production target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-high-speed-baton-drones-for-battlefield-deployment/	2025-02-10T05:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/small_whatsapp-image-2025-02-10-at-14-03-21-8d5a19a207-2.webp
Czech authorities investigating allegations of unauthorized drone shipments to Ukraine	Prague is investigating allegations of unauthorized drone shipments from Czechia to Ukraine, Ceske Noviny reported on Feb. 9, citing Defense Minister Jana Cernochova. The investigation is focused on the Nemesis project, organized by the Skupina D association, which has been raising funds to procure drones for Ukraine. According to media outlet Aktualne.cz, members of Skupina D are suspected of supplying drones to Ukraine, possibly with the involvement of Czech military personnel, without authorization from the parliament. Czech military police spokesperson Katerina Mlynkova confirmed that authorities are examining &quot;possible unauthorized handling of Defense Ministry property and possible use of military personnel outside the tasks of the armed forces.&quot; According to Aktualne.cz, members of the Czech Army&apos;s 601st Special Forces Group allegedly transported military equipment to Ukraine without the necessary parliamentary approval. The Czech constitution requires lawmakers&apos; consent before deploying national armed forces abroad. An unnamed source cited by the outlet claimed that &quot;someone decided to send soldiers&quot; to Ukraine with military equipment without following proper legal procedures. At least one such trip reportedly took place in 2024. &quot;We can&apos;t just close up and say everything is fine when we know it&apos;s not, based on the inspection,&quot; Cernochova said. Last year, Cernochova voiced concerns over the Czech Army&apos;s General Staff&apos;s participation in the Nemesis initiative. The Defense Ministry subsequently launched an inspection over the use of military facilities for drone testing. Chief of Staff of the Czech Army, General Karel Rehka, is the honorary chairman of Skupina D. According to the Czech media, Rehka&apos;s relationship with Minister Cernochova has long been mired by disputes over defense procurement. Despite the controversy, the Nemesis drone initiative has gained significant public support, raising over 203 million Czech crowns ($8.5 million) to supply drones to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/czech-authorities-investigating-drone-shipments-to-ukraine/	2025-02-10T05:45:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/dsc00143.jpg
Romanian President Iohannis announces resignation to avert political crisis	Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Feb. 10 to avert a possible crisis caused by an upcoming parliamentary vote on his impeachment. Far-right opposition parties submitted, for the third time, an initiative to the Romanian parliament to impeach the president, as Iohannis remained in office longer than the prescribed term after the results of the country&apos;s first round of presidential election had been annulled. Speaking to reporters, Iohannis said he is resigning to avoid the internal and external crisis in Romania. &quot;We will become a laughingstock for the whole world,&quot; he said. Iohannis&apos;s resignation will enter into force on Feb. 12. According to the Romanian constitution, Senate chairman Ilie Bolojan from the National Liberal Party should serve as the interim head of state. Iohannis has served as Romania&apos;s president since 2014. His second presidential term ended on Dec. 21, but he remained in office until his successor was sworn in. The results of the first round were annulled by the constitutional court over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok meant to prop up far-right Romanian politician Calin Georgescu. Pro-Russian Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner after the Nov. 24 vote, securing 23% of the ballots. Pro-EU candidate Elena Lasconi came in second with 19%. The far-right politician, who has opposed military support for Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania, remains the leading candidate for the rescheduled vote in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-president-announces-resignation/	2025-02-10T05:33:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184592124.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Inside Ukraine's historic first all-drone assault on Russian positions	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Feb. 8, 2025, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine &#x2014; In the early hours of December 2024, as the sun began to rise, the sound of drones filled the air. But this wasn&#x2019;t just any drone operation. This was the first successful all-drone assault on Russian positions &#x2014; a groundbreaking event in the history of modern warfare. The attack took place near Lyptsi, in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine. Initially expected to fail, the mission tested whether multiple drone units could coordinate an assault with dozens of FPV, recon, turret-mounted, and kamikaze drones working in unison on the ground and in the air. The Counteroffensive is the first news outlet to publish a detailed account of this milestone in drone warfare, based on interviews with some of the unit&#x2019;s military officers. &quot;Happy,&quot; the call sign of a soldier from Mykolaiv Oblast, is known for his ever-present smile and a mustache groomed to resemble that of a Zaporizhzhian Cossack. He chose the distinctive look to stand out. For security reasons, he asked to be identified only by his call sign. At just 22 years old, he commands a platoon known as the Ground Unmanned Robotics Unit, nicknamed &#x201C;Deus Ex Machina,&#x201D; which translates from Latin as &#x201C;a God from a machine.&#x201D; &#x201C;We will be here until the end. We will defend our land, and we will move forward to victory with confidence,&#x201D; Happy told The Counteroffensive. Happy graduated from a military university in Kyiv and later joined the Khartiia Brigade. His background is in military engineering, with a focus on demining and placing mines. He spoke while alternating between curling his Ukrainian-styled mustache and taking drags from his cigarette. Happy began commanding the platoon this past summer. In just a few months, he and his unit became quick experts in using, innovating with, and repairing Ukrainian ground drones &#x2014; while also developing effective tactics for using them alongside other weaponry. &#x201C;When we felt discomfort, we developed. We did not have expertise in drones, so it was uncomfortable for us,&#x201D; Happy explained. &#x201C;It forced us to work more intensively on ourselves and with drones.&#x201D; The unit has a less-strict culture than the rest of the Ukrainian military, reflecting its role as a laboratory for cutting-edge military innovations. &quot;It doesn&apos;t really matter what your rank is. It depends on people. If you have people who can do things efficiently, we don&#x2019;t care about your rank. It can be some random soldier who does better work than a high-profile officer. We don&#x2019;t care about this,&quot; said &#x201C;Mathematician,&#x201D; an officer who advises units on using drone technology for maximum tactical impact. The units involved in this assault were tasked by the Khartiia Brigade commander with a mission: could they organize an all-drone assault within a week &#x2014; and pull it off?

(Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;I was skeptical&#x2026; and didn&#x2019;t expect any level of success,&#x201D; Mathematician said, adding that the higher-ups half-expected they would soon receive word that the drone force had been wiped out early in the mission. To make this work, they needed to invent a new playbook. It was a completely novel approach to an assault. As part of the planning, they established checkpoints, routes, and designated communication channels. The assault was rehearsed three times, with one of the main concerns being that the Russians might spot the incoming wave of Ukrainian drones and destroy them before they could be deployed effectively. Given the significant ordnance being carried by the ground drones, an early Russian counterattack could have caused the kamikaze drones to explode, destroying the entire assault force. Forty-eight hours before the mission, drones were moved to their starting points. Success was defined as all drones arriving at their targets and hitting their designated assignments. The mission involved complex logistics and communication. No swarm technology was used, meaning each drone was piloted by an individual operator. Less than 100 soldiers participated in the operation, including pilots, logisticians, planners, and support staff &#x2014; launching around 30 drones, according to Mathematician. The operation used several kamikaze and machine-gun-mounted ground drones, FPVs &#x2014; including one with a mounted assault rifle &#x2014; and large copter drones that dropped munitions. Dozens of surveillance and recon drones provided battlefield awareness. Multiple units were involved, though the Ukrainian military declined to specify which units or how many. They also declined to share how the troops communicated. What is known is that the ground and aerial drones worked together, with pilots stationed in different locations, coordinating the mission while monitoring the battlefield from a shared video feed. What took days to plan took just one or two hours to execute. The assault took place along a heavily fortified Russian position near a large forest. The simultaneous waves of ground and aerial drones caught the Russians off guard, causing panic. While aerial drone attacks are common on the front lines, the coordinated use of ground drones was unexpected. Ukrainian forces intercepted Russian communications revealing chaos and fear among Russian troops, who were fighting machines with no human soldiers in sight. This was the intended effect: to create pressure on the Russian lines and suppress the enemy. Thanks to careful planning, they didn&#x2019;t lose any drones to Russian electronic warfare, which often disrupts communication between pilots and drones. Several Russian FPV drones attempted to strike the attacking Ukrainian drones but were unsuccessful. Terrain posed a major challenge. Ukrainian mud, known for its thick, sticky texture, made movement difficult for cars, tanks, and ground drones alike. The trade-off between air and ground drones comes down to payload. Air drones can fly over obstacles but carry much less weight, while ground drones carry more but must contend with thick mud and foliage. During the mission, one Ukrainian ground drone got stuck in the mud. However, a planner from the unit noted it was never destroyed and was eventually recovered. The mission exceeded expectations: right after the ground drones completed their task, infantry moved in and secured the position, Mathematician told The Counteroffensive. Ukrainian troops still hold the position today. The goal of the mission was to save Ukrainian lives. The more drones are used in operations, the fewer human lives are at risk. &quot;The advantage is obvious: robots do it, not people. And if robots are destroyed, they don&#x2019;t feel pain. It&#x2019;s just a tin can. It is much better to lose a drone than the life of a human,&#x201D; Happy said. This success will likely lead to more iterations, experimentation, and larger-scale attacks. &quot;This is just the beginning. We will work to do more &#x2014; and even better &#x2014; missions,&quot; Happy said. When not working with drones, Happy is a fan of Stephen King novels. He&#x2019;s no stranger to the horror of unintended consequences. He is particularly concerned about how artificial intelligence might merge with drone technology. While drones can&#x2019;t make most decisions without human input &#x2014; yet &#x2014; he worries about the potential for a major mistake. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a matter of time before a person makes a big mistake,&#x201D; he said. Despite these concerns, Happy remains optimistic about the immediate future. He is also disinterested in taking credit for this significant achievement in military technology. For now, he&#x2019;s unsure how to contextualize the achievement. Perhaps he will only understand its significance years from now, with the benefit of time. Right now, it&apos;s too close to what happened. And there&apos;s still much work to do.

Russia massing troops for new assaults in Chasiv Yar, military warns	Russian forces are concentrating troops for fresh assaults in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, a spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Feb. 10. Chasiv Yar in Ukraine&apos;s east has been one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The town, located 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kramatorsk, has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July 2024. &quot;Now there is a period of accumulation and concentration (of Russian forces)... on the approaches to Chasiv Yar and regrouping in the town itself for further assault operations,&quot; Zaporozhets said on national television. The spokesperson added that over the past week, Russian forces have avoided using armored vehicles, instead relying on quad bikes and buggies for logistical support. 0:00/1&#xD7;A view of the streets of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, amid intense fighting as Russia continues its offensive in Ukraine&apos;s east. (Interior Ministry / Facebook).On Jan. 29, The Moscow Times reported that Chasiv Yar had fallen to Russian forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially confirmed the claim. Comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers indicate that intense fighting continues in the town. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces slowing Russia&apos;s advances through brutal street-to-street combat. Despite Russian pressure, Ukrainian defenders resist, preventing a rapid breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-massing-troops-for-assault-on-chasiv-yar-ukrainian-military-says/	2025-02-10T05:05:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159885054.jpg
Illegal border crossing attempts in Ukraine have nearly halved since last summer, Border Guard says	The State Border Guard has recorded a decrease in attempts to illegally cross Ukraine&apos;s border since July 2024, spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on Feb. 10. &quot;If we compare January with July last year, we see a 45% decrease,&quot; Demchenko said. Speaking on national TV, the spokesperson said that despite this trend, attempts to illegally cross the border occur every day. Men of the conscription age are prohibited from leaving the country during martial law, save for several exceptions. Many attempt to reach neighboring countries in spite of that, hoping to avoid mobilization. Most such cases occurred outside the checkpoints on the border with Romania and Moldova, and fewer cases are recorded on the border with Slovakia and Hungary. The lowest number of attempts to illegally cross the border outside of checkpoints was recorded on the border with Poland, according to the spokesperson. There have been multiple reports of men attempting to illegally flee Ukraine by swimming the Tysa River, which flows along the border with Hungary, Romania, and Moldova. &quot;Attempts to illegally cross the border through checkpoints continue. Most of these cases occur on the border with Poland, because it has the highest passenger traffic,&quot; Demchenko added. People turn to criminal groups to plan a route for escape, offering them money, the spokesperson said. More than 760 such groups have been uncovered since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, including around 40 in January 2025, Demchenko said. Some countries, like Lithuania or Poland, voiced support for helping Ukraine bring back its military-aged men living abroad but rejected the possibility of forcibly deporting them.	https://kyivindependent.com/illegal-border-crossing-attempts-have-nearly-halved-since-last-summer-ukraines-border-guard-says/	2025-02-10T04:31:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152827912.jpg
EU vows retaliatory measures as Trump set to announce 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum	The European Commission on Feb. 10 threatened retaliatory measures if U.S. President Donald Trump goes forward with his plan to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. Trump said on Feb. 9 that Washington would announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. later this week. The EU&apos;s executive arm commented that it had &quot;not received any official notification regarding the imposition of additional tariffs on EU goods&quot; but said it would &quot;react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.&quot; The European Commission criticized the decision as &quot;unlawful and economically counterproductive,&quot; arguing that the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S. would suffer under such restrictions. The dispute over tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on American goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting the tariffs and replacing them with a quota system. In exchange, the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s latest move threatens to reignite the trade dispute. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that tariffs on EU goods could backfire on the U.S. economy by driving inflation. In an interview with CNN, Macron urged Washington to focus on confronting China, managing the Middle East crisis, and supporting Ukraine rather than engaging in a &quot;trade war&quot; with its European allies. The announcement comes amid a flurry of executive orders from Trump&apos;s administration in his first weeks back in office, which have caused domestic and international disruptions. These include freezing foreign aid, tightening immigration policies, and conducting a widespread purge of federal agencies. The freeze on foreign aid has already affected key organizations in Ukraine, including independent media and efforts to repair the country&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-vows-retaliatory-measures-as-trump-announces-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum/	2025-02-10T04:06:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Europe mulls large-scale seizures of Russia's 'shadow fleet' ships, Politico reports	European countries are privately discussing large-scale seizures of Russian oil tankers in the Baltic Sea after a number of incidents, Politico reported on Feb. 10, citing two unnamed EU diplomats and two government officials. The media outlet referred to a late December incident in which an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia was damaged, likely by a tanker believed to be part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. The Eagle S vessel, carrying Russian oil, was detained in Finnish territorial waters in connection to the incident. Helsinki launched an investigation to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that &quot;NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea&quot; following the incident in the Gulf of Finland. According to Politico, European countries are also drafting new legislation that would enable potential seizures of Russian oil tankers on legal grounds. Among the proposals under consideration is the use of international law to seize vessels on environmental or piracy grounds. Individual countries could also make independent decisions, jointly introducing new national laws to arrest ships in more distant maritime zones, the news outlet wrote. Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that nearly 50% of the sanctioned trade in Russian marine oil goes via the Gulf of Finland. The Nordic countries have been on high alert due to mounting security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes in the Nordic countries. The European Union, the U.K., and the U.S. have slapped sanctions on oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet. In early February, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; captains, targeting Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other methods to bypass price caps.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-large-scale-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-politico-reports/	2025-02-10T03:19:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Zelensky-Putin talks and Kursk strike | Ukraine This Week	This Sunday, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur gives updates on Ukraine-Russia peace talks, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s ongoing aid freeze, and the debate surrounding a deadly strike on civilian infrastructure in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-putin-talks-and-kursk-strike-ukraine-this-week/	2025-02-10T03:16:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_8798.jpg
Transnistria rejects EU aid offer under Moscow's pressure, Moldova's PM says	The Moldovan government said that Transnistrian authorities refused to accept the European Union&apos;s offer of 60 million euros ($62 million) in energy aid under pressure from Moscow, the Moldovan media outlet Newsmaker reported on Feb. 10. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that Tiraspol rejected the EU&apos;s financial assistance due to the conditions attached to the aid, attributing the decision to Russian influence. The Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria has faced critical energy shortages since Russia&apos;s Gazprom halted its gas supplies in January, a move coinciding with Ukraine ending a deal on Russian gas transit. The Russian energy giant claimed the decision was taken due to an alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues. &quot;Tiraspol has refused (the EU&apos;s offer of aid). Russia does not allow them to accept European aid for fear of losing control over the region,&quot; Recean said. The European Commission has offered 60 million euros ($62 million) to Transnistria as part of its two-year strategy on energy support for Moldova. The aid package was contingent on commitments from local authorities to improve &quot;fundamental freedoms and human rights&quot; and to ensure that the funds would not be used for &quot;energy-intensive activities.&quot; According to Recean, the primary condition that led Transnistrian authorities to reject the aid was a requirement for a gradual increase in consumer tariffs. &quot;As a result, they cannot receive European aid. This means that the residents of Transnistria will continue to live in a state of unpredictability,&quot; he added. Despite the rejection, Chisinau said it would continue supplying gas to the region. Moldova&apos;s government reached an agreement with Hungary&apos;s MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG, which will secure funding from Dubai&apos;s JNX General Trading to provide gas. &quot;Both companies have been audited and will supply gas to the Moldovan border under a contract with Moldovagaz... This is not an agreement between the Moldovan government and Russia; it is a decision to keep people (in Transnistria) from freezing,&quot; Recean said. Currently leading talks on EU accession, Moldova has pivoted toward European supplies but remains dependent on electricity from Transnistria&apos;s Kuciurgan power plant, which runs on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-rejects-eu-aid-offer-under-moscow-pressure-moldovan-pm-says/	2025-02-10T02:50:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Scholz, Merz agree on continued support for Ukraine ahead of German elections	German Chancellor Olaf Schlolz and his chief challenger in the upcoming elections, Friedrich Merz, agreed during a television debate on Feb. 9 that Berlin must continue supporting Ukraine and that Russia&apos;s war must end as soon as possible. Polls show Merz&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance as a clear favorite for the Feb. 23 snap elections. The vote was called after Social Democrat (SPD) Scholz&apos;s ruling coalition lost the parliamentary majority with the exit of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). During the debate, Merz said that the war &quot;could have ended sooner if Ukraine had been supported more decisively and with less hesitation,&quot; reiterating his earlier position that Germany should provide Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz, whose government has become the second-largest military donor to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war, has long refused to supply the long-range cruise missiles, fearing it could draw Germany into the conflict. Merz called for a united strategy between Europe and the U.S. allies on the Russia-Ukraine war and warned against excluding Ukraine from the conversation. According to the German conservative leader, it is also important to see what Washington&apos;s next steps will be. The German chancellor, in turn, stressed the need to help Ukraine build up a powerful army, reminding the assistance his government had already provided. &quot;We must help Ukraine have a strong army. Because its economy will not be able to finance an army of the size it needs for defense,&quot; Scholz said. Berlin has supplied Kyiv with $11 billion in military assistance since 2022, ranking below only the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The provided hardware included Leopard 1 and 2 tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, Patriot, IRIS-T, and Gepard air defenses, and more. As Ukraine&apos;s leading European backer, Germany is expected to play a key role in the pro-Kyiv coalition amid the uncertain future of U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-merz-agree-on-germanys-continued-support-for-ukraine/	2025-02-10T02:22:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198031078.jpg
European Investment Bank head Calvino arrives in Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The European Investment Bank (EIB) head, Nadia Calvino, arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 10, the EU Ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, announced. The news comes as 19 EU member states have proposed expanding financing for arms production through the EIB on Jan 31. The step aims to ensure that the European defense industry responds appropriately to both short- and long-term challenges, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv signed a financing agreement with the European Investment Bank under the Recovery III project at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin last year. Great to arrive in Kyiv with @NadiaCalvino, welcomed warmly by @Pertsovskyi_O.

Trump claims 'progress' on ending Russia-Ukraine war, confirms contact with Putin	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 9 that the United States had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to disclose details about his communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Putin had been in contact. Asked whether the conversations occurred before or after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump said: &quot;I&apos;ve had it. Let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve had it. &#xA0;And I expect to have many more conversations.&quot; The president also noted the U.S. was in contact with both Russia and Ukraine. &quot;If we are talking, I don&apos;t want to tell you about the conversations. I do believe we&apos;re making progress.&quot; Trump first revealed he had spoken to Putin during an interview with the New York Post on Feb. 8 without revealing specifics of their talk, adding only that the Russian leader &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has pushed for a swift resolution to the war, aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the administration&apos;s aim to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; Trump announced on Feb. 7 that he might meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington in the coming days and expressed interest in a meeting with Putin &quot;very quickly.&quot; Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-confirms-talks-with-putin-says-making-progress-on-ending-russias-war/	2025-02-10T01:16:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
China's Xi to visit Moscow for Victory Day celebrations, Russian envoy says	Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to visit Moscow on May 9 to attend Russia&apos;s Victory Day celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, pro-Kremlin media Interfax reported on Feb. 10, citing Russian Ambassador to Beijing Igor Morgulov. Morgulov also claimed that Xi invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to China to commemorate Japan&apos;s surrender and the conclusion of World War II. Beijing has not yet officially commented on these reports. China has strengthened ties with Russia since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, becoming Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of dual-use goods that bolster Russia&apos;s defense industry. The Kremlin uses Victory Day celebrations for propaganda purposes, showcasing its military might and drawing on the Soviet victory in World War II to justify its aggression against Ukraine. Putin has falsely accused Ukraine of fascist and Nazi tendencies, framing the invasion as an effort to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; the country &#x2014; rhetoric rooted in Russia&apos;s broader disinformation campaign. While China has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war, it has simultaneously criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying weapons to Ukraine. NATO has labeled China a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s aggression. North Korean soldiers will reportedly participate in Russia&apos;s Victory Day parade in Moscow for the first time, Japanese broadcaster NHK World reported in January. Slovakia&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico also said he had accepted Putin&apos;s invitation to attend the May 9 celebrations. Ukraine has distanced itself from Soviet-era commemorations. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 2023 law moving Ukraine&apos;s World War II remembrance day to May 8, aligning with most of Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-xi-to-visit-moscow-for-victory-day-celebrations-russian-envoy-says/	2025-02-10T00:28:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2179663881.jpg
2 killed, 16 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least two civilians and injured 16 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 10. Overnight, Russia launched 83 Shahed-type combat drones and decoy drones, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 61 drones over 11 oblasts, while 22 others were lost without causing damage. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed one resident of Kramatorsk, and 12 others were wounded in Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, one person was injured, and another was killed in Russian drone attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Sumy Oblast, a civilian was injured, and windows in four apartment buildings and 15 cars were damaged in Russian strikes, according to the region&apos;s military administration. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 32-year-old man was injured in a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack on the village of Liutivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, an 83-year-old woman suffered injuries to her arm during Russian shelling of the front-line town of Huliaipole, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine has endured daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities consistently reporting casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-16-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day-2/	2025-02-09T23:58:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-09_23-12-38.jpg
Drones reportedly target key Russian oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai	Drones attacked Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10, reportedly targeting the Afipskiy oil refinery, a key facility processing 6.25 million tons of oil annually, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. The refinery, located roughly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the front line, is a strategic logistics hub for diesel fuel and aviation kerosene used by Russian troops, Kovalenko said. While other Ukrainian officials have not commented on the report, the strike would align with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to disrupt Russian fuel supplies and reduce Moscow&apos;s war funding. It is not immediately clear whether the refinery suffered significant damage in the attack. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed the drone attack against the region, saying that a residential complex in Krasnodar was hit. According to the governor, downed drone debris fell on a technical superstructure of a high-rise building, causing no casualties. The Russian Telegram channel Shot, close to Russian security forces, reported that residents heard powerful explosions around 2:00 a.m. local time, with eyewitnesses noting &quot;air defense activity&quot; near the Afipskiy refinery. Kovalenko emphasized the refinery&apos;s importance, claiming it provides fuel for Russian military equipment, particularly in southern Ukraine. &quot;That is why the Afipskiy refinery is not only an industrial facility but also an important element of Russia&apos;s military infrastructure,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues, a critical source of funding for its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-russian-oil-refinery-in-krasnodar-krai-key-fuel-hub-for-military/	2025-02-09T23:08:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-7_50_17-AM.jpeg
Zelensky, Vance to meet at Munich Security Conference, CBS News reports	Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance are expected to meet during the Munich Security Conference later this week, CBS News reported on Feb. 9, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a quick resolution of Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine that nears its three-year mark. The U.S. delegation to the top European security conference, taking place between Feb. 14 and 16, will also include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg. Though the details of the expected Vance-Zelensky meeting have not been disclosed, Kellogg previously said that U.S. officials would talk in Munich about Trump&apos;s &quot;goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine.&quot; The retired general later denied media reports that he was planning to unveil Trump&apos;s strategy for ending the war during the event. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&#x2019;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-vance-to-meet-at-munich-security-conference-cbs-news-reports/	2025-02-09T22:39:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176025411.jpg

According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,001 tanks, 20,813 armored fighting vehicles, 36,638 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,879 artillery systems, 1,273 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,059 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,623 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-850-490-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-09T22:15:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Thousands of North Koreans taking construction jobs in Russia, media reports	Thousands of North Koreans entered Russia in 2024 to take jobs in construction, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 9. The report comes a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Moscow&apos;s key ally, pledged his country&apos;s unwavering support for Russia as it pursues its &quot;just cause&quot; in Ukraine. North Korea sent thousands of workers to take jobs at construction sites across Russia in 2024, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS). The move represents an apparent violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions passed in the wake of North Korea&apos;s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests. Russia is party to U.N. Resolution 2397, a 2017 decision that prohibits North Korea from sending its citizens to work overseas. Moscow and Pyongyang may be skirting the prohibition in the guise of student visas, Yonhap reported. According to data from Russia&apos;s federal statistics service, 13,221 North Koreans entered Russia in 2024 &#x2014;&#xA0;up 12 times from the previous year. Nearly 8,000 of those arrivals reportedly claimed to be entering the country for educational purposes. Russia has faced severe labor shortages as a consequence of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both military mobilization and the decreasing number of migrants entering the country have exacerbated the crisis, and Russia is heading into a drastic population decline over the next two decades. The 13,000 North Korean workers will not reverse Russia&apos;s economic downturn, but the recent arrivals may mark &quot;the beginning of larger influxes ... that could more significantly help Russia&apos;s labor shortage issues,&quot; analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote on Feb. 9. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014;&#xA0;including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014;&#xA0;to sending soldiers. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian troops in countering a Ukrainian incursion in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-of-north-koreans-taking-construction-jobs-in-russia-media-reports/	2025-02-09T21:14:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184920006.jpg
We need to recoup those costs' — Mike Waltz on future of US aid to Ukraine	United States National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Feb. 9 that U.S. officials will discuss the future of Washington&apos;s financial support for Ukraine during meetings in Europe this week. Waltz&apos;s comments come ahead of the Munich Security Conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. President Volodymyr Zelensky will head Ukraine&apos;s delegation, while the U.S. will be represented by Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, will also attend the conference. Waltz told NBC News that &quot;the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine&quot; was among President Donald Trump&apos;s priorities for the coming talks. &quot;We need to recoup those costs,&quot; Waltz said. &quot;And that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians, in terms of their rare earths, their natural resources, and their oil and gas, and also buying ours. Those conversations are going to happen this week.&quot; The future of U.S. aid to Kyiv has been murky since Trump won re-election in November with promises to swiftly end the war and get America &quot;out&quot; of the conflict. Previously approved weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have allocated any new military aid to Ukraine. In recent days, Trump has suggested that new aid shipments might depend on trade deals that the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. Trump said on Feb. 3 that he wanted to offer Ukraine weapons and aid in return for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Zelensky has said he&apos;s open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s reserves of rare earth minerals in exchange for Washington&apos;s continued support. Waltz also said that Europe would need to take on a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,&quot; he said. &quot;President Trump is going to end it, and then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.&quot; According to Waltz, Trump is prepared to impose sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;Russia&apos;s economy is not doing well. (Trump) is prepared to tax, to tarrif, to sanction. We need to get all sides to the table to end this war,&quot; he said. Trump has been engaging other world leaders in his efforts to bring about a ceasefire, Waltz said. He claimed that Trump has recently discussed the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and &quot;leaders across the Middle East.&quot; Waltz declined to comment on Trump&apos;s recent claim, reported in the New York Post, that he has personally discussed ending the war in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Waltz did not confirm or deny that such a conversation had taken place.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-to-recoup-those-costs-mike-waltz-on-future-of-us-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-09T19:02:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
EU should consider 'full trade embargo' on Russia, Estonian president says	The European Union should stop importing Russian energy products and &quot;seriously consider&quot; a complete trade embargo against Russia, Estonian President Alar Karis said on Feb. 9. Karis&apos; statement comes a day after the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected their energy systems from Russia&apos;s power grid, marking a historica shift away from Russian energy dependence and toward European integration. &quot;European Union should boost independence even further and end all Russian energy imports to the EU,&quot; Karis said in a post on X Feb. 9. &quot;We should even seriously consider a full trade embargo on Russia.&quot; In the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European countries took measures to significantly reduce their dependence on Russian energy products. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gasimports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027. Energy exports help fuel Moscow&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine, leading to calls among Kyiv&apos;s allies to phase out the purchases completely. Estonia has ranked among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion, offering humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Estonia has also pushed for harsher sanctions against Russia, including complete economic isolation. Ukraine imposed a full trade embargo on Russia in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-should-consider-full-trade-embargo-on-russia-estonian-president-says/	2025-02-09T17:13:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/P1390565_synced_00_09_35_21_Still002-1.jpg
Musk to reveal fraud, slash 'billions' at Pentagon, Trump says	Elon Musk will likely uncover billions of dollars in wasteful and fraudulent spending at the U.S. Defense Department, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 9. Musk, currently the world&apos;s richest man, heads the Trump-established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an organization tasked with eliminating waste from the federal budget. Trump praised Musk&apos;s work &#x2014;&#xA0;which has thus far included mass government layoffs and unprecedented cuts to humanitarian aid &#x2014;&#xA0;as &#xA0;&quot;terrific.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him very soon&#x2026; to go check the Department of Education. He&apos;s going to find the same thing. Then I&apos;m going to go into the military. Let&apos;s check the military,&quot; he told Fox News on Feb. 9. &quot;We&apos;re going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse, and the people elected me on that.&quot; The remarks come amid Trump and Musk&apos;s joint efforts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), America&apos;s chief foreign aid distributor. Musk has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization.&quot; USAID funds critical reconstruction efforts in Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. It also supports a range of humanitarian initiatives worldwide, such as clean water access, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. The Trump administration has frozen all foreign aid for 90 days and plans to lay off most of USAID&apos;s global workforce. While Trump and Musk have repeatedly denounced widespread fraud at the agency, they have not provided any evidence to support these claims. The White House has also taken steps in the last two weeks to dismiss government officials and replace them with Trump loyalists. Reuters reported in November 2024 that the Trump team wasalso &#xA0;preparing lists of names for mass dismissals at the Pentagon. Musk&apos;s attempts to slash funding at the Pentagon may further threaten the already tenuous future of U.S. military support for Ukraine. Previously allocated weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have approved new arms shipments to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-to-reveal-fraud-slash-billions-at-pentagon-trump-says/	2025-02-09T16:28:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418262-1.jpg
Kursk incursion stopped Russian invasion of Zaporizhzhia, Zelensky claims	Ukraine&apos;s offensive into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast prevented Russian forces from carrying out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with ITV News on Feb. 7. Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. Speaking during an interview with the British outlet ITV News on the six-month anniversary of the incursion, Zelensky called the Kursk operation &quot;one of our most successful operations.&quot; The aim of the incursion was to create &quot;a buffer zone&quot; that would protect Ukraine&apos;s major northeastern cities, Kharkiv and Sumy, from another Russian offensive, Zelensky said. Russia launched a new assault against Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, advancing as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles) before Ukrainian troops halted the advance at the first line of defense. &quot;(T)he idea was to preventatively carry out an attack and create a buffer zone not on Ukrainian territory, but on Russia&apos;s territory in those regions,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s what happened.&quot; The Kursk incursion prevented Russia from fulfilling its operational goals in Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, while also providing Ukraine with nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers to replenish Kyiv&apos;s prisoner exchange fund, Zelensky said. It also prevented Russia from a southern offensive, he claimed. &quot;(T)hey withdrew their operational forces from the south of our country, because they were planning to attack Zaporizhzhia, this was their next operation after Kharkiv and Sumy, they were going to Zaporizhzhia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;So they were forced to give up their military units from the Zaporizhzhia direction and parts from the East.&quot; Russia redirected troops in these regions to Kursk Oblast, Zelensky alleged. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. Zelensky said on Nov. 25 that Ukraine was tracking Russian troop movement in the southern region, and had observed &quot;existing threats.&quot; While the military reported that Russian forces have deployed assault groups in the region, Moscow has not yet staged a large-scale offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, instead concentrating its attacks in eastern Ukraine. Parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast have been occupied by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion of 2022. The region remains a regular target of Russian aerial attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-incursion-stopped-russian-invasion-of-zaporizhzhia-zelensky-claims/	2025-02-09T15:31:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/ze.png
Ukraine to launch 'Drone Line' project to enhance battlefield operations	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 9 the launch of the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; a new military initiative aimed at integrating unmanned aerial systems into frontline operations. The project seeks to enhance combat effectiveness by expanding the use of drones within elite units of the Ground Forces and the State Border Guard Service. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov described the initiative as a transformative step in modern warfare, emphasizing that unmanned systems will play a central role in combat. &quot;This is the new standard of war, where unmanned systems become a key element of combat, helping our defenders carry out the most complex missions,&quot; Umerov said. The first phase of the project will focus on five elite regiments and brigades: the 20th Separate Regiment &quot;K-2,&quot; the 429th Regiment &quot;Achilles,&quot; the 427th Regiment &quot;RAROH,&quot; the 414th Brigade &quot;Magyar&apos;s Birds,&quot; and the &quot;Phoenix&quot; Regiment, which is part of the &quot;Pomsta&quot; Brigade. These units have already demonstrated effectiveness in drone warfare and will now see their capabilities significantly scaled up, according to the minister. By integrating infantry and UAVs into a unified strike system, the Drone Line aims to create a 10-15 kilometer deep kill zone, ensuring that enemy forces cannot move without sustaining heavy losses. &quot;This will fundamentally change battlefield tactics, giving our warriors a decisive advantage,&quot; Umerov said in his post on Facebook. The initiative will also provide constant aerial support for infantry and enhance target detection and destruction before adversaries reach Ukrainian positions. The Defense Ministry credited President Volodymyr Zelensky for spearheading the initiative and highlighted the ongoing work of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry in advancing drone technology.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-launch-drone-line-project-to-enhance-battlefield-operations/	2025-02-09T12:35:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186291789.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv says Russian Su-25 warplane downed in Donetsk Oblast, 70 Russian drones shot down overnight	Key developments on Feb. 8-9: Ukraine&apos;s military said on Feb. 8 that it had downed a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft near the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;One more Russian attack aircraft has been lost in the Toretsk direction thanks to our air defense troops,&quot; the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Telegram. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the brigade&apos;s report. The report comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold the front amid a grinding Russian offensive, facing severe manpower and resource shortages. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is fighting to retain its last strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, now nearly in its fourth year. The Soviet-designed Su-25, nicknamed &quot;Frogfoot&quot; by NATO, is a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft. It has seen extensive use by both sides in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi highlighted key military achievements during his first year in office, including long-range strikes, technological advancements, and NATO-standard training, in a Facebook post on Feb. 8. According to the statement, over the past year, Ukraine&apos;s defense forces successfully targeted 377 military sites in Russia, with attacks reaching as far as 1,700 km. &quot;DeepStrike&apos;s range deep into Russian territory has already reached 1,700 kilometers. We are preparing new long-range weapons, which will indeed be used,&quot; Syrskyi said. The Ukrainian Air Force and defense units also destroyed 9,200 air targets, more than doubling the previous year&#x2019;s total. Additionally, Ukraine has worked to modernize its military structure, introducing extended training programs of 1.5 months, and shifting foreign weapons training to Ukraine to optimize costs and efficiency. Syrskyi highlighted the transition to NATO standards in training, command, and troop management, reinforcing Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic alignment with Western military principles. &#x201C;The preservation of Ukrainian soldiers&apos; lives remains our top priority. To achieve this, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive program focused on modernizing the army, improving soldier training, and enhancing medical care at all stages,&#x201D; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Syrskyi to his position on Feb. 8, 2024, in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Prior to his appointment, Syrskyi served as the head of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces and commanded the Khortytsia Operational and Strategic Group fighting in eastern Ukraine. Following the full-scale invasion, he played a key role in the Battle of Kyiv, Ukraine&apos;s successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast in fall 2022, and the Battle of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military is planning to introduce &quot;special contracts&quot; to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. &quot;Combat brigades, experienced ones, together with the Defense Ministry have been working on a contract option for young people aged 18 to 24,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is for those who want to join up, it is not a mobilization.&quot; Such contracts will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; according to the president. He said the details of such contracts would be made public in the coming days. The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said in January that Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract young people exempt from mobilization. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. Ukrainian air defense shot down 70 Russian drones across the country overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Feb. 9. Drones were shot down over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 74 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Decoy drones are less deadly, but are much cheaper to manufacture and being combined with other drones in an attempt to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence service said last year. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall. These deadly attacks have forced civilians to live under constant threat and often target critical infrastructure in an attempt to knock out water, heating, or electricity services.

The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 10-Feb. 16. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. This week&#x2019;s key event is the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC), taking place on Feb. 14-16. European defense, Europe-US relations, and Ukraine support/ ceasefire talks will take center stage (all major themes at a somewhat nervous Feb. 3 &#x201C;informal retreat&#x201D; of EU 27 + UK + NATO leaders; Ukraine was not invited). Special US Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg is expected to visit Kyiv, either before heading to Munich or &#x201C;later in February&#x201D; (note: while it would make sense for Kellogg to visit Kyiv before Munich, heartening Ukrainians and signaling a peace deal will not be made &#x201C;over their heads&#x201D;, we see some uncertainty) Kellogg stated that US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is developing a reliable plan to end the war within 100 days. Kellogg is expected to attend MSC (but not to present the plan, which is Trump&#x2019;s prerogative), together with Vice-President JD Vance (he will travel there from the AI Action Summit on Feb. 10-11 in Paris) and possibly the US president himself. (note: This year&#x2019;s MSC comes just a week before snap elections in Germany, which could influence ongoing German support for Ukraine.) Earlier, the European Parliament will hold a plenary session in Strasbourg on Feb. 11 on maintaining the EU&#x2019;s unwavering support for Ukraine, which is awaiting a vote. The session will review ongoing and future commitments across military, economic, and humanitarian assistance and Ukraine&#x2019;s EU accession process Key topics expected are additional weapons deliveries, long-term security assistance, joint procurement of ammunition and air defense systems, and legal and political challenges to using Russian assets held within the EU to finance Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction. MEPs will also discuss renewing the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology between the EU and Ukraine. The agreement facilitates joint research projects, knowledge exchange and funding opportunities between Ukrainian and EU institutions. Renewal would ensure continued access to collaborative scientific initiatives. The &#x201C;Ramstein summit&#x201D; of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) is expected to take place on Feb. 12 in London under the chairmanship of the UK (rather than the US, likely a signal of US disengagement from Europe). UDCG includes over 50 countries (incl. all 32 NATO members). It previously met at the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany If you have an upcoming event that you would like featured in our newsletter, please get in touch via insights@kyivindependent.com.

Explosion on oil tanker at Russian port prompts investigation	An explosion occurred on an oil tanker at the Ust-Luga port in northwest Russia in the morning of Feb. 9, prompting an evacuation of the crew, according to the country&apos;s Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport (Rosmorrechflot). Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident. Rosmorrechflot reported on Telegram that the blast took place in the engine room of the Koala, a vessel docked at the port west of St. Petersburg. While the explosion forced crew members to leave the ship, officials said that no oil spill or cargo leak had occurred. The ship was not at risk of sinking, they added. The incident follows a series of tanker-related accidents in recent months. In December, two oil tankers were wrecked in the Black Sea, causing a large fuel spill that continues to wash up along the shoreline. The tanker, built in 2023 and sailing under the Antigua and Barbuda flag, had arrived at Ust-Luga on Feb. 6, according to ship-tracking data from Vesselfinder. Russia&#x2019;s Baza Telegram channel reported that the vessel was carrying 130,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. Authorities have not yet disclosed the cause of the explosion, and the ship&apos;s condition is set to be inspected. The U.S. government in January designated over 180 Russian vessels as part of a &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to export crude oil despite Western sanctions. However, the Koala is not included in this list. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s security services claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a fuel terminal at Ust-Luga, describing the port as a hub for Russia&#x2019;s sanctioned oil and gas exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-on-oil-tanker-at-russian-port-prompts-investigation/	2025-02-09T10:05:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
Musk calls for shutting down US-funded outlets Radio Free Europe, Voice of America	Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Feb. 9 called for shutting down U.S.-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Responding to comments by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions Richard Grenell, Musk wrote on X: &quot;Yes, shut them down. Europe is free now (not counting stifling bureaucracy). Nobody listens to them anymore. It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.&quot; &quot;Radio Free Europe and Voice of America are media outlets paid for by the American taxpayers. It is state-owned media. These outlets are filled with far left activists,&quot; Grenell reportedly said on Feb. 9. &quot;I&#x2019;ve worked with these reporters for decades. It&#x2019;s a relic of the past. We don&#x2019;t need government paid media outlets.&quot; Both Elon Musk and Richard Grenell have voiced strong opposition to government funding of media organizations, arguing that taxpayer money should not be used to support these outlets. Musk, as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has criticized federal payments to media organizations like Politico, the Associated Press, and The New York Times, deeming them inefficient uses of taxpayer funds and moving to eliminate them. Similarly, Grenell, as Trump&#x2019;s special mission envoy, has publicly condemned government spending on media subscriptions, echoing Musk&apos;s stance that such funding should be terminated immediately. These calls come amid broader scrutiny and controversy surrounding government-funded media, with the Trump administration taking steps to halt subscriptions to outlets like Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-calls-for-shutting-down-us-funded-outlets-radio-free-europe-voice-of-america/	2025-02-09T09:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196638354.jpg
German military investigates unidentified drones flying over German military bases where Ukrainians train, media reports	Germany&apos;s Bundeswehr is investigating potental espionage after unidentified drones were spotted six times in January flying over a sensitive German military base where Ukrainians have been training, Der Spiegel reported on Feb. 9. Germany failed to force the drones to land or to locate their pilots despite the use of special jamming devices, the Der Spiegel report said. The &#xA0;Schwesing base is located in the North Sea and has been used to train both Germans and Ukrainians on the Patriot air defense system. These advanced weapons systems have played a crucial role in defending Ukraine&apos;s skies from missile and drone attacks, which have drastically increased over the past several months. The Bundeswehr believes Russia is the top suspect behind the drone flights, said Der Spiegel, referencing an internal report on the matter. Incidents of drones believed to be spying on German bases where Ukrainians train have been reported for over a year. In December, Germany charged three German-Russian citizens with espionage on behalf of Moscow, after the suspects were said to have photographed and explored potential targets in Germany for sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-military-investigates-unidentified-drones-flying-over-german-military-bases-where-ukrainians-train-media-reports/	2025-02-09T07:45:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-158520585-1.jpg
Ukraine gas imports remain high after infrastructure attacks, Reuters reports	Ukraine is maintaining high levels of gas imports from the EU after a series of Russian missile attacks on its gas facilities, according to a Reuters report on Feb. 9. Ukraine imported 16.3 million cubic meters on Sunday, Reuters said, citing data provided by the operator of the state-run gas transmission system. The gas appeared to come from Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in western Ukraine. Earlier in the week, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. He declined to provide figures on the severity of the impact. At the beginning of this year, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers using Ukraine&apos;s pipelines. The deal had expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-gas-imports-remain-high-on-sunday/	2025-02-09T07:37:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/344739975_907645373861326_5870873476025670998_n.jpg
Ukraine's ambassador to Poland gives more details on Volyn exhumation plans	Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Bodnar, said on Feb. 8 that the preparations for the exhumation of remains of Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy are underway. Speaking in an interview with Polish TV channel TVN24, Bodnar said that exhumation will begin in the spring, but that the exact time will depend on the weather. Work is already underway to determine all the locations in Poland and Ukraine where exhumations will need to be carried out, he said, according to Ukrainian media. The Volyn tragedy, also known as the Volyn massacres, took place in 1943 in Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) killed tens of thousands of poles. Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed by Polish military in retaliation. The topic of the massacres and the long-unresolved dispute over exhumation of the remains have strained relations between the two allies. Poland repeatedly raised the issue as a potential roadblock to Ukraine&apos;s desire to join the EU, before Speaker of the Polish Parliament Szymon Holownia walked back these statements in September. A breakthrough on the issue was announced in January, when the two countries agreed to begin first exhumations of the victims. Later in the month, Polish media said that the exhumations would begin in April. According to Bodnar, Ukrainian legislation requires a licensed Ukrainian company to carry out the exhumations. A Polish partner for the project has been identified, he said. While Poland is providing the majority of the funding, Ukraine is also financing part of the project, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-ambassador-to-poland-gives-more-details-on-volyn-exhumation-plans/	2025-02-09T06:50:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-24-at-2.52.23-PM.png
Russian drone strike injures 2 in Nikopol, governor says	A Russian kamikaze drone injured two men in Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Feb. 9, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on Telegram. The victims, ages 41 and 39, suffered varying degrees of injuries, according to Lysak. &quot;One of them sustained an explosive mine injury and a shrapnel wound to the face. He will be treated as an outpatient. The other is hospitalized in serious condition,&quot; he wrote. A gas station and a car were also damaged in the attack, Lysak said. Nikopol, located on the banks of the destroyed Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-injures-2-in-nikopol-governor-says/	2025-02-09T05:27:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-09-15_02_02.jpeg
70 Russian drones shot down overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian air defense shot down 70 Russian drones across the country overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Feb. 9. Drones were shot down over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 74 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Decoy drones are less deadly, but are much cheaper to manufacture and being combined with other drones in an attempt to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence service said last year. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall. These deadly attacks have forced civilians to live under constant threat and often target critical infrastructure in an attempt to knock out water, heating, or electricity services.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-shooting-down-70-russian-drones-overnight/	2025-02-09T03:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump wants Ukraine's 'rare earths'	The following is the Feb. 4, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. President Donald Trump came out on Feb. 3 saying he wanted to make a deal with Ukraine by giving the war-torn country weapons and aid in return for its &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he said. It&#x2019;s not quite clear what exactly Trump meant by &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; Ukraine is home to all sorts of highly sought-after raw materials from critical minerals to rare earth elements. What&#x2019;s more clear is why Trump wants them. China controls 70% of global rare earth mining capacity and 90% of processing capacity. Having easy access to these materials could boost the U.S.&#x2019;s competitiveness &#x2014; something at the top of the new president&#x2019;s &#x201C;America First&#x201D; agenda. For Kyiv&#x2019;s part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has positioned Ukraine&#x2019;s natural materials as part of a peace plan. Reports late last year said Zelensky&#x2019;s team had even delayed a deal on critical materials with former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s team so it could offer it to Trump in case he won the elections. So what critical resources does Ukraine actually have and how viable are they, really? Ukraine has 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals like titanium used in the aerospace and defense industries and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. Ukraine also possesses rare earth elements &#x2014; under which titanium and lithium do not fall &#x2014; such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Demand for these materials has jumped in recent years as the world shifts to renewable forms of energy. Rare earth elements are crucial for making the powerful magnets used in wind turbine generators. The issue, however, is geography. Raw materials are unevenly distributed across Ukraine and around $12 trillion has ended up in Russian-occupied territory, according to SecDev, a global digital risk and resilience firm. And there&#x2019;s the fact that a lot of these mineral deposits are underdeveloped, with the total value unknown, according to an analysis from the Kyiv School of Economics. Existing estimates put the value of Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals anywhere between $3-$26 trillion. Read reporter Dominic Culverwell&#x2019;s full article here. Ukrainian then-President Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 17, 2010. (Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images)Making millions off stolen Ukrainian resourcesSpeaking of critical resources. Oleksandr Yanukovych, the son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, has made billions selling coal from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories to Turkey, independent Russian investigative outlet Important Stories reported on Feb. 4. Viktor Yanukovych was Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin president from 2010 to 2014 before fleeing to Russia with his family in the wake of the EuroMaidan Revolution. In October 2024, reports emerged that Oleksandr Yanukovych had been granted Russian citizenship. The company behind the coal exports, Energoresurs, is registered in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, and has exported nearly half a million tons of coal abroad between 2023 and 2024. Journalists linked Energoresurs to Oleksandr Yanukovych through his coal holdings and mining enterprises. According to the investigation, the firm sources coal from suppliers in occupied Donbas and transports it to Turkey by rail and sea. The coal is reportedly sold to an offshore company, Energy Union, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Energoresurs sells the coal at a significantly low price &#x2014; an average of $60 per ton in 2024 &#x2014; allowing the company to minimize export duties before reselling it at a higher price on international markets. A Huless tethered drone system. (Brave1/LinkedIn)Ukrainian drone maker attracts $1 millionHuless, a Ukrainian company developing tethered drone systems, secured over $1 million in private financing, loans, and a grant from Ukrainian Defense Tech cluster Brave1, the company said in a press release on Jan. 30. Huless makes the Highline-T, a drone that can operate for up to four hours at heights up to 100 meters, even without GPS signals, the company says. Unlike kamikaze or bomber drones that blow up Russian positions or vehicles, the Highline-T&#x2019;s main function is to carry radio equipment that boosts the operational range of other drones and remote-controlled ground vehicles. The tethered drone stays connected to the ground via a cable that provides constant power and data connection independent of interference from electronic warfare. Huless plans to use the funding to expand its market presence and develop its tethered drone technology for military communications, the company said.

(Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)Front-line lifelineOne of the oddities of Russia&#x2019;s war has been the parallel realities that coexist, almost seamlessly: on the one side are daily air raid sirens, Russian attacks, and casualties, on the other, people grabbing coffee, children going to school, businesses growing. Nowhere are these two starkly divergent realities more clear than near the front lines. Reporter Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko took a trip to the front-line town of Druzhkivka, located just 15 kilometers from the embattled city of Chasiv Yar to talk to the local entrepreneurs and businesses that remain despite the dangers. In one scene in Sekretarenko&#x2019;s article, taxi driver Serhiy Pohrebnyakov sits calmly behind the wheel of his car waiting for customers as explosions go off and people around begin running in different directions for cover. Beyond the services or goods they provide &#x2014; taxi rides, baked bread, and shampoo and razors for soldiers at roadside kiosks &#x2014; these small businesses contribute to a semblance of normalcy in their community amid all the devastation wrought by Russia.

Poor harvests and higher wages amid labor shortages are currently driving the rising inflation, according to the bank. Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% year-on-year in December 2024, surpassing the bank&#x2019;s earlier projections. After peaking in the middle of the year and cooling to 8.4% by year&#x2019;s end, the bank expects inflation to reach a target 5% in 2025. Ukraine&apos;s largest private delivery company Nova Poshta invested Hr 1.8 billion ($43 million) to expand its Ukrainian network in 2024, a 35% increase from 2023, the company said on social media. The company opened 1,747 new branches across Ukraine and installed 8,410 self-service delivery package lockers in 2024, bringing the total number of its service points across the country to 37,210. Within the last six months, 93 companies in Ukraine have removed signs of Russian ownership and continue to do business in the country, despite a moratorium on altering the registration of companies with Russian owners, the monitoring service Opendatabot reported. The monitoring service also found that some of these companies have participated in the Ukrainian public procurement tenders. Ukraine&#x2019;s State Property Fund announced an auction to privatize the state-owned Radiorele plant in Kharkiv &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s largest switching equipment manufacturer, the fund said on Feb. 3. Radiorele produces low-current, miniature, electromagnetic switches, and relays, which are used to control voltage, current, and temperature in electrical systems. The plant has been put up for auction in the past but has so far been unable to attract a buyer. The auction, which is for a 100% stake in the plant, will be held on Feb. 4. Its starting price is Hr 234.4 million ($5.6 million), which includes debts for the last six months. Ukrainian cafe chain Lviv Croissants opened its first restaurant in Cannes, France, making it the fifth country outside of Ukraine where it now operates, the company said in a press release on Feb. 3.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 12	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 12 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 27&#x2013;Feb. 2, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukrainian Government approves Ukrposhta&#x2019;s plan to establish a bank The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has approved the transfer of shares in First Investment Bank, formerly owned by Russian stakeholders, to the Community Development Ministry, with plans for subsequent ownership by state postal operator Ukrposhta. The decision, made on Jan. 28, paves the way for Ukrposhta to launch its own bank by 2025. According to Ukrposta, the planned postal bank will not engage in large-scale corporate lending or high-risk foreign exchange transactions. Instead, it will focus on providing basic financial services to rural and front-line communities, addressing financial inclusion gaps in underserved regions. After extensive discussions with international partners, such conditions for establishing a bank based on Ukrposhta were included in the text of Ukraine&#x2019;s memorandum with the IMF. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to resume legislative work on Feb. 11 Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada will hold a session on Feb. 4 to formally open its new legislative term, though no decisions are expected, as the meeting is a constitutional requirement. The first plenary week, during which lawmakers will debate and vote on key legislation, is scheduled to begin on Feb. 11. However, it remains uncertain whether lawmakers will consider two key bills &#x2014; the repeal of the &#x201C;Lozovyi amendments&#x201D; and the creation of the High Administrative Court. Both are structural benchmarks under Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF memorandum. Ukraine meets another milestone under the Ukraine Facility program President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed into law Bill #12131, which introduces a system for monitoring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation fulfills one of the key requirements under Ukraine&#x2019;s financial assistance plan within the Ukraine Facility program. Kyiv was expected to meet this condition by the end of the second quarter of 2025 as part of its broader commitments to European integration and environmental governance. Zelensky backs Defense Minister amid defense procurement dispute President Zelensky voiced support for Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in an ongoing dispute with the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). &#x201C;The defense minister has the right to do everything necessary to prevent any delays in supplies,&quot; Zelensky stated In his recent interview for Associated Press. The president&#x2019;s comments follow concerns raised by Ukraine&#x2019;s international partners. Earlier on Feb. 3, G7 ambassadors urged Kyiv to resolve the situation at the DPA, emphasizing the importance of adhering to good governance principles and NATO recommendations to maintain public and international trust. The dispute escalated after the DPA&#x2019;s Supervisory Board decided to extend the contract of its head, Maryna Bezrukova, for another year. However, the Defense Ministry refused to approve the decision, leading to her removal. Arsen Zhumadilov was appointed as interim director. Over the past week, the leadership of the DPA has changed six times in the official registry, highlighting the ongoing turmoil in the agency&#x2019;s management.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-12/	2025-02-09T03:02:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-843323892.jpg
Trump says he spoke with Putin about ending war in Ukraine, New York Post reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine but declined to say how many times they had spoken, the New York Post reported on Feb. 8. Trump also claimed that Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if he had been president in 2022. He told the New York Post, which interviewed him aboard Air Force One, that he &quot;always had a good relationship&quot; with Putin. Trump said he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&#x2019;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot; He also said he believes Putin &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he could not confirm or deny whether Trump had spoken with Putin. Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have emphasized their desire for a swift resolution to the war. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they hoped to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; The administration had previously set a goal of reaching a resolution within the first 100 days of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Also on Feb. 7, Trump said he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky next week in Washington. Zelensky has said Ukraine&#x2019;s security is his priority in any negotiations and that it is crucial for him to meet with Trump before any talks with Putin. &quot;It is very important. Otherwise, it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters in an interview published Feb. 7. &quot;It is still important for partners to discuss their issues first and then have a conversation with the enemy.&quot; Trump has also stated that Washington wants access to Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-spoke-with-putin-about-ending-war-in-ukraine-new-york-post-reports/	2025-02-09T01:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg

Team Ukraine to compete in 2025 Invictus Games with largest-ever delegation	Team Ukraine is set to compete in the 2025 Invictus Games, which officially began on Feb. 8 in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada. The team, consisting of 35 injured Ukrainian soldiers&#x2014;the largest Ukrainian delegation yet &#x2014; arrived in Canada on Jan. 31 after six months of training. Ukraine will face Colombia in the Group C Preliminary Round of wheelchair basketball, the first sport of the competition. This year&#x2019;s games will feature 550 athletes with disabilities, injuries, and illnesses from 25 different countries, competing across 11 sports, from Alpine skiing to swimming. &#x201C;The Ukrainian community in British Columbia and across Canada are deeply honored to welcome Ukraine&#x2019;s Heroes... to the Invictus Games,&#x201D; Ukrainian Canadian Congress West Vice President Natalka Jatskevich said on Feb. 8.

Russia says it sees no progress on disarmament talks with US, media reports	Russia has yet to see any positive developments from the new U.S. administration regarding disarmament, Russia&#x2019;s permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, said on Feb. 9. He noted that while Moscow remains open to cooperation, there has been no progress within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, an international forum that has previously negotiated key arms control agreements. Gatilov reiterated Russia&#x2019;s willingness to maintain stable relations with the U.S. administration but emphasized that Washington has yet to take concrete steps toward resuming arms control discussions. &quot;We expect that the Americans will move from words to action, especially since they have made numerous statements on the matter since January 20,&quot; he told Russian state media. The remarks come as Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed hope that Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House could usher in a new phase in U.S.-Russia relations. Both leaders have indicated interest in an in-person meeting, with Trump emphasizing his intention to end the war in Ukraine. Despite these signals, nuclear arms control discussions between Moscow and Washington remain stalled. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems for both countries, is set to expire on Feb. 5, 2026. With no active negotiations to extend or replace it, the treaty remains the last major nuclear arms control agreement between the world&#x2019;s two largest nuclear powers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sees-no-progress-on-disarmament-talks-with-us-media-reports/	2025-02-08T19:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1826910292--1-.jpg
Russia says its undersea telecom cable in Baltic Sea damaged by 'external impact'	Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled telecom giant Rostelecom announced on Feb. 8 that one of its underwater cables in the Baltic Sea had been damaged due to an &quot;external impact.&quot; The company did not specify the cause of the damage but confirmed that repair work was underway. Rostelecom said that the incident did not affect consumers, according to AFP. The damage comes amid a series of recent disruptions to undersea telecom and power cables in the Baltic Sea. Western experts and officials have accused Russia of engaging in hybrid warfare against countries supporting Ukraine. On Jan. 30, Norwegian authorities detained the Silver Dania vessel with a Russian crew on suspicion of damaging an undersea fiber-optic cable linking Latvia and Sweden. NATO has responded by increasing patrols to safeguard critical underwater infrastructure. On the same day, Finland&apos;s coast guard reported that a Russian vessel was conducting repairs on a damaged underwater cable in the Gulf of Finland. Finnish authorities confirmed that the incident took place within Finland&#x2019;s exclusive economic zone but did not provide details on how or when the damage occurred. In response to growing concerns over subsea security, NATO launched a patrol mission in January to protect vital infrastructure in the region. The operation, called &quot;Baltic Sentry,&quot; involves aircraft, frigates, submarines, and drones monitoring the area for potential threats. Similar incidents have been reported in the past when Finnish authorities discovered damage to another Rostelecom cable in the Baltic Sea. That incident coincided with disruptions to underwater infrastructure in both Sweden and Finland, further raising suspicions of deliberate sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-says-its-undersea-telecom-cable-in-baltic-sea-damaged-by-external-impact/	2025-02-08T18:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
NATO military chair visits Ukraine, discusses continued support with Zelensky	NATO Military Committee Chair Giuseppe Cavo Dragone met with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 8 during his visit to Ukraine. The two toured a long-range weapons plant and held a meeting to discuss ongoing military assistance. Ukraine has relied on NATO in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine consistently voices its intentions to join the military alliance and regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders. Zelensky and Dragone met to discuss preparations for the next Ramstein format meeting and Ukraine&apos;s defense needs. &quot;We are grateful to NATO for its support of Ukraine from the very beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. Thank you very much for your first mission and decision to be in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky and Dragone discussed strengthened coordination of military assistance within the Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) framework, a command plan designed to allocate and coordinate military assistance to Ukraine. &quot;The message I would like to convey not only to you but to everyone is that NATO is on your side. We are determined to fulfill all our commitments and to defend all the values and principles that we share,&quot; Dragone said on Feb. 8. Dragone and Zelensky further discussed direct investment in Ukrainian arms production following the &quot;Danish model&quot; of financing in a visit to a long-range missiles plant. The Danish model of financing aims to more effectively utilize military spending by funding domestic weapons production amid restrictions on foreign long-range weapons.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-nato-chair-meet-discuss-long-range-weapons-future-summit/	2025-02-08T17:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/ZelenskyDragone.jpeg

UK announces $31 million social recovery aid package for Ukraine	The UK is allocating 25 million pounds ($31 million) to launch a social recovery initiative in Ukraine called the SPIRIT program, the British government announced on Feb. 8. Announced during Foreign Secretary David Lammy&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, the program is a collaboration between the UK, Ukraine&#x2019;s government, UNICEF, and the World Bank. Through the funding, the support will &#x201C;help Ukraine to meet the varied needs of the population, and accelerate Ukraine&#x2019;s Euro-Atlantic pathway,&#x201D; the statement read. The SPIRIT initiative will concentrate on three key priorities: expanding access to quality social services, with at least 10,000 families in ten regions benefiting; establishing an Office of Social Recovery under Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Social Policy to coordinate reforms and international partnerships; and launching cross-sectoral initiatives in health, economy, and social services to support vulnerable groups. The program will also provide small grants and training for 100 civil society and local community representatives to expand service delivery and create a sustainable social support system. With a focus on women, families with children, people with disabilities, the elderly, and veterans, SPIRIT aims to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s institutional capacity to manage the social and economic challenges caused by the war. &#x201C;Investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s social systems is an investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s people - and we know that Ukraine&#x2019;s people are its greatest resource,&#x201D; Martin Harris, UK Ambassador to Ukraine, said of the program.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-31-million-social-recovery-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-02-08T13:47:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162001991.jpg
Syrskyi marks first year in office by highlighting key achievements, including strikes on 377 military targets in Russia	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi highlighted key military achievements during his first year in office, including long-range strikes, technological advancements, and NATO-standard training, in a Facebook post on Feb. 8. According to the statement, over the past year, Ukraine&apos;s defense forces successfully targeted 377 military sites in Russia, with attacks reaching as far as 1,700 km. &quot;DeepStrike&apos;s range deep into Russian territory has already reached 1,700 kilometers. We are preparing new long-range weapons, which will indeed be used,&quot; Syrskyi said. The Ukrainian Air Force and defense units also destroyed 9,200 air targets, more than doubling the previous year&#x2019;s total. Additionally, Ukraine has worked to modernize its military structure, introducing extended training programs of 1.5 months, and shifting foreign weapons training to Ukraine to optimize costs and efficiency. Syrskyi highlighted the transition to NATO standards in training, command, and troop management, reinforcing Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic alignment with Western military principles. &#x201C;The preservation of Ukrainian soldiers&apos; lives remains our top priority. To achieve this, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive program focused on modernizing the army, improving soldier training, and enhancing medical care at all stages,&#x201D; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Syrskyi to his position on Feb. 8, 2024, in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Prior to his appointment, Syrskyi served as the head of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces and commanded the Khortytsia Operational and Strategic Group fighting in eastern Ukraine. Following the full-scale invasion, he played a key role in the Battle of Kyiv, Ukraine&apos;s successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast in fall 2022, and the Battle of Bakhmut.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-marks-first-year-in-office-by-highlighting-key-achievements-including-strikes-on-377-military-targets-in-russia/	2025-02-08T11:36:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
North Korea to start drone production in collaboration with Russia, media reports	North Korea is expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported on Feb. 8, citing undisclosed sources. The agreement will allow North Korea to develop and mass-produce several types of drones in coordination with Russia. According to the sources, the drone production initiative is likely a reciprocated gesture to North Korea after the country has sent soldiers to support Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. This cooperation follows last year&#x2019;s strategic partnership treaty between the two countries. Artyom Lukin of Russia&apos;s Far Eastern Federal University, previously told Reuters that the agreement is &quot;for all intents and purposes... a pact of military alliance,&quot; Moscow&apos;s &quot;first defense alliance outside the post-Soviet space.&quot; The agreement also covers trade, investment, political and security cooperation. As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers were fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, according to Budanov. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-to-start-drone-production-in-collaboration-with-russia-media-reports/	2025-02-08T09:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157616618.jpg
Military to introduce 'special contracts' to motivate younger volunteer fighters, Zelensky says	The Ukrainian military is planning to introduce &quot;special contracts&quot; to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. &quot;Combat brigades, experienced ones, together with the Defense Ministry have been working on a contract option for young people aged 18 to 24,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is for those who want to join up, it is not a mobilization.&quot; Such contracts will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; according to the president. He said the details of such contracts would be made public in the coming days. The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said in January that Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract young people exempt from mobilization. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-special-contract-for-mobilization-exempt-18-24-year-olds-to-be-presented-soon/	2025-02-08T08:59:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
ICC prosecutor who oversaw arrest order for Putin over Ukrainian children deportation included in Trump's nonpublic sanction list, Reuters reports	International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, who oversaw the court&apos;s arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over Moscow&apos;s deportation of Ukrainian children, was named in the U.S.&apos; as-of-now nonpublic economic and travel sanctions list, Reuters reported on Feb. 7. British national Khan is the first to be targeted under the sanctions authorized by newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump that &quot;target the war crimes tribunal over investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies,&quot; Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. In its report, it said, citing sources including a senior ICC official, that Khan was named in the executive order that Trump signed on Feb. 6. &#xA0; Russia included Khan on a wanted list in 2023 after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and another Russian official, Maria Lvova-Belova, for &quot;unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Khan&apos;s sanctions would mean prohibiting him and his family from entering the U.S., as well as the freezing of their U.S. assets. Khan&apos;s regular trips to the U.S. to brief the United Nations Security Council are part of the U.N.-Washington agreement, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/icc-prosecutor-who-oversaw-arrest-order-for-putin-over-ukrainian-children-deportation-included-in-trumps-unpublic-sanction-list-reuters-reports/	2025-02-08T08:34:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197645700.jpg
Scholz says talk of German peacekeepers in Ukraine 'premature and inappropriate'	Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a Feb. 8 interview that discussions over Germany potentially deploying its peacekeeping troops to Ukraine are &quot;premature and inappropriate.&quot; He told the German newspaper RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) that &quot;first there needs to be an end to the conflict and real negotiations,&quot; and only then it would be possible to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;I find such debates inappropriate and premature,&quot; Scholz told RND. &quot;Because it is assumed that Ukraine will not get parts of its territory back from Russia.&quot; The Telegraph reported in November that, under one of the peace plans being considered by U.S. President Donald Trump, he might call on British and other European troops to enforce a buffer zone that the president would attempt to establish in place of the current front line in Ukraine. The comments come as Ukraine struggles to hold the front line amid relentless Russian offensives in the east. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is increasingly on the back foot, especially in Donetsk Oblast, as it scrambles to gather manpower and resources to defend its last strongholds there. The future of Western military aid remains as uncertain as ever with the return of Trump, a Ukraine skeptic who says he is determined to push both sides into negotiations to end the war. &quot;In any case, Ukraine will have an army that it will not be able to pay for with its financial means alone, and that is where we and all of Ukraine&apos;s friends will be called upon,&quot; Scholz told RND. In January, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the German opposition party Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said that Berlin should not rule out deploying its troops to Ukraine after the war ends, German newspaper Schw&#xE4;bische Zeitung reported. His remarks came as the U.K. and France considered sending their own troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-calls-discussion-over-germany-potentially-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-post-war-ukraine-premature-and-inappropriate/	2025-02-08T07:42:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147904710.jpeg
Ukraine says it downed Russian Su-25 warplane in Donetsk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s military said on Feb. 8 that it had downed a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft near the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;One more Russian attack aircraft has been lost in the Toretsk direction thanks to our air defense troops,&quot; the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Telegram. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the brigade&apos;s report. The report comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold the front amid a grinding Russian offensive, facing severe manpower and resource shortages. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is fighting to retain its last strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, now nearly in its fourth year. The Soviet-designed Su-25, nicknamed &quot;Frogfoot&quot; by NATO, is a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft. It has seen extensive use by both sides in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-downed-russian-su-25-warplane-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-08T07:00:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1234099297.jpeg
Security guarantees for Ukraine 'main issue' in talks with Trump, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Feb. 7 interview that security guarantees for Ukraine are the &quot;main issue&quot; he seeks to discuss with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said on Feb. 7 that he may meet Zelensky next week in Washington. In an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7, Zelensky stressed that it was important for him to meet Trump first before he holds talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;It is very important, otherwise it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters. &quot;It is still important for partners to discuss their issues first, and then have a conversation with the enemy.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come as Ukrainian troops gradually withdraw across the front, struggling with critical manpower shortages and resource constraints. The future of Western military aid remains as uncertain as ever with the rise of Ukraine skeptic Trump to power as Kyiv&apos;s most powerful ally. The Ukrainian leader has long taken a firm &apos;no&apos; stance on any negotiations with Russia. Kyiv emphasizes that Moscow easily breaks promises and that talks have failed over more than 10 years of war. &quot;We have absolutely everything for this - we need peace,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters. Zelensky also commented on Kyiv&apos;s earlier offer to to buy and store liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S. in Ukraine. &quot;It is very interesting for us, I know it&apos;s very interesting for the Trump administration,&quot; he said. &quot;We are ready and willing to have contracts for LNG supplies to Ukraine. And of course, we will be a hub for the whole of Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-security-guarantees-main-issue-to-discuss-with-trump/	2025-02-08T06:08:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Baltic countries disconnected from Russia's power grid	Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected their energy systems from Russia&apos;s electric power grid on Feb. 8 in &quot;another historic day for European integration,&quot; the Estonian Foreign Ministry said. &quot;This legacy of occupation meant that Moscow - which uses energy as a weapon - had control of the frequency,&quot; the ministry said in a statement on X. &quot;That&#x2019;s a critical element in maintaining reliable power supply. That dependency ends today!&quot; The Lithuanian Energy Ministry said in July 2024 that the Baltic countries would fully synchronize with the continental European electricity grid in February 2025. &#xA0; Earlier in February, Latvian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said in an interview that his country is ready for technical difficulties and possible sabotages during the synchronization process. Ukraine also disconnected itself from the Russian energy grid in February 2022, when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. &quot;We stopped buying electricity &amp; gas from Russia right after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,&quot; the Estonian Foreign Ministry said in its Feb. 8 statement. &quot;By making our whole energy system independent of Russia, the Kremlin loses another lever of power to use against Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-countries-exit-russias-energy-grid/	2025-02-08T04:29:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197714501.jpg
Air Force reports shooting down 67 Russian drones overnight	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on Feb. 8 that air defense had shot down 67 Russian Shahed and other drones across the country overnight. The drone attack targeted Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 71 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Russia has launched daily drone attacks against Ukraine, forcing civilians &#x2014; even in cities far from the front line &#x2014; to live under constant threat. The drones have often targeted critical infrastructure, sometimes leaving people without water, heating, or electricity. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-shooting-down-67-russian-drones-overnight/	2025-02-08T02:54:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/shahed-2.jpg
Russia claims 36 Ukrainian drones downed, oil refinery attacked	An oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast was among the targets of a Ukrainian overnight drone strike on Feb. 8, Russian local authorities claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 36 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by air defense. These include 18 drones over Rostov Oblast, 11 over Volgograd Oblast, five over Belgorod Oblast, and two over Krasnodar Krai. Volgograd Oblast Governor Andrei Bocharov said on Telegram on Feb. 8 that the air defense had intercepted a Ukrainian drone strike on an oil refinery in the Kumylzhenskaya District, over 200 kilometers northwest of Volgograd. Bocharov said no fire had erupted from the falling debris, and no casualties or damage were reported. Despite being on the back foot on the front line, Ukrainian troops have begun to actively strike deep into Russia using their homemade drones, often targeting military sites, oil refineries, and air fields.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-down-36-ukrainian-drones-local-authorities-say-oil-refinery-targeted/	2025-02-08T01:33:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1489472156.jpeg

End war 'as quickly as possible' — US defense secretary outlines Ramstein aims	The United States has a key message for the upcoming Ramstein-format summit in Brussels: end the war in Ukraine &quot;as quickly as possible,&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 7. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will convene on Feb. 12, with the U.K. replacing the U.S. as host for the first time. It is also the group&apos;s first meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. Hegseth will attend the UDCG summit as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagon statement published Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to &quot;reiterate President Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,&quot; the statement read. &quot;He will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.&quot; The UDCG includes more than 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members. Formed in April 2022, the coalition coordinates international military aid to Ukraine, typically meeting at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. At the previous Ramstein summit, discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses and bolstering domestic defense production. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense, and some of Ramstein&apos;s former functions have already been transferred to NATO control. Trump has also signaled ambivalence regarding ongoing U.S. military aid to Kyiv and has repeatedly promised to secure a swift &quot;deal&quot; to end the war. Previously allocated weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have approved new arms shipments to Ukraine. While Kyiv&apos;s best hopes for continued U.S. military assistance may lie in a possible rare earth elements deal, European allies have pledged to ramp up their support for Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Feb. 7 that the upcoming Ramstein summit will yield important decisions on air defense systems and investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, was confirmed as defense secretary on Jan. 24, after U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tie-breaking vote to secure his appointment. Hegseth was among Trump&apos;s most controversial nominees, both due to inexperience and multiple allegations of professional misconduct and sexual assault.	https://kyivindependent.com/end-war-as-quickly-as-possible-us-defense-secretary-outlines-ramstein-aims/	2025-02-07T21:21:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196790881.jpg
Trump's pick for FBI chief took money from Russian propagandist, WP reports	Kash Patel, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 7. A number of Trump&apos;s nominees and allies have faced scrutiny for their apparent support of Russia amid the full-scale war against Ukraine. Patel received the $25,000 payment from Global Tree Pictures, Lopatonok&apos;s Los Angeles-based company, according to financial disclosures submitted as part of his nomination process and seen by the WP. The payment came after Patel participated in a documentary about Trump that aired on TCN, the online network of right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson. Lopatonok holds U.S-Russian dual citizenship and has produced numerous projects advancing pro-Kremlin narratives. Though born in Ukraine, Lopatonok has made films criticizing the EuroMaidan Revolution and appeared on a red carpet alongside pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk, a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was detained by Ukrainian authorities on charges of treason in 2022 and later exchanged in a prisoner swap with Russia. Lopatonok has also claimed Russian state media directors and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko as his supporters, the WP reports. In 2023, Lopatonok helmed a project titled &quot;To Russia With Love&quot; that aimed to circulate pro-Russian videos online. The influence campaign reportedly receive $31,000 in funds from a foundation established by Putin. Patel partnered with Lopatonok on a documentary series called &quot;All the President&apos;s Men,&quot; which portrayed Patel and other figures from Trump&apos;s first term as victims of a conspiracy aimed at undermining the president. The series was broadcast on the online network &#xA0;of Tucker Carlson, who has also frequently spouts Kremlin propaganda narratives and infamously interviewed Putin in Moscow last year. &#xA0; In the documentary, Patel says that Russia is not among the &quot;true enemies&quot; of the U.S. He also promises to &quot;shut down the FBI headquarters building and open it up as a museum to the deep state.&quot; Patel is a Trump loyalist who, if confirmed as FBI director, would hold one of the top positions in the administration. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent in November 2024, U.S. national security expert Evelyn Farkas described Patel as one of Trump&apos;s &quot;yes men.&quot; &quot;Kash Patel, for example, is a guy who also seems to have no principles, only wants power and has a sense of grievance like Trump, so he&apos;s willing to do whatever it takes to make Trump happy,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pick-for-fbi-chief-took-money-from-russian-propagandist-wp-reports/	2025-02-07T19:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196773597.jpg
US federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's efforts to suspend USAID staff	A United States federal judge on Feb. 7 imposed a temporary restraining order on U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s plans to place thousands of employees at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on administrative leave. Before the temporary block, over 2,000 USAID staffers had been set to go on administrative leave at midnight. The &quot;very limited&quot; restraining order covers the the pending employee suspensions as well as &quot;the accelerated removal of people from their countries,&quot; Judge Carl Nichols said following a hearing in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Earlier on Feb. 7, Trump called for the immediate closure of the agency, writing &quot;CLOSE IT DOWN!&quot; on the platform Truth Social. A notice posted on USAID&apos;s website informed staff that all the agency&apos;s direct hires worldwide would be placed on administrative leave as of Feb. 7, 11:59 p.m. The announcement said the agency would pay for their return to the U.S. within 30 days, with limited case-by-case extensions available. Unions representing USAID workers filed for a temporary restraining order to block the surprise suspension, arguing that Trump&apos;s efforts to dismantle the agency are &quot;unconstitutional and illegal.&quot; During the hearing, Judge Nichols, a Trump appointee, asked Acting Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate to explain why the layoffs were so urgent. Shumate said that Trump had determined there was fraud and corruption at USAID, without providing any evidence. Trump has targeted USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, from his first days in office. His administration has ordered a three-month freeze on nearly all international development funding and reportedly plans to lay off most of the agency&apos;s global workforce. The White House has repeatedly accused USAID of widespread waste and fraud, even though foreign aid comprises only 1% of the federal budget. The administration earlier this week placed the agency under the control of the State Department. Crews were seen on Feb. 7 removing the USAID signage from the front of the agency&apos;s headquarters in Washington. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency&apos;s progromas help to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, repair critical energy infrastructure, and fund civil society initiatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-efforts-to-suspend-usaid-staff/	2025-02-07T17:44:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Putin acknowledges inflation as key challenge for Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Feb. 7 that inflation remains a major challenge for the country&#x2019;s economy and directed the government to develop measures to lower it in 2025. Speaking at a televised meeting with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Putin noted that consumer prices in Russia rose by 9.5% in 2024 and have climbed further to 9.9% year-on-year this month, according to the Moscow Times. Putin reportedly emphasized the need for &quot;balanced growth&quot; and reiterated his expectation for the government to present a plan to address inflation and advance structural economic changes. &quot;The task for this year is to reach a balanced growth trajectory, to reduce inflation,&quot; he said, according to a Kremlin transcript. Mishustin reported that the Russian economy grew by 4.1% in 2024, revising an earlier estimate of 3.6% for 2023 to match the latest figure. However, he agreed with Putin that inflation was the biggest concern. The Russian Central Bank recently said that it sees &quot;no signs of a sustainable slowdown in price growth&quot; despite maintaining a high key interest rate of 21%. The regulator pointed to Western sanctions, the ruble&#x2019;s depreciation, and a weak harvest as key inflationary pressures. Additionally, increased defense spending is driving demand beyond the economy&#x2019;s capacity to supply goods and services. The Central Bank forecasts inflation to ease to a range of 5.2% to 8.6% by the end of 2025. Its next rate meeting is scheduled for Feb. 14, where policymakers will assess further measures to stabilize the economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-inflation-as-key-challenge-for-russia/	2025-02-07T16:54:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
US sanctions strain Russia’s oil exports as shipping costs surge, Bloomberg reports	Russia is facing a significant oil transportation crisis due to recent U.S. sanctions, according to Bloomberg oil strategist Julian Lee. On Jan. 10, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 161 oil tankers involved in transporting Russian crude, adding to a series of measures imposed by the Biden administration. These restrictions, which President Donald Trump has yet to relax, have already caused a sharp increase in shipping costs for Russian oil exports. The impact of these sanctions is evident in the rising cost of securing tankers to transport Russia&#x2019;s Urals crude to Asia. Data from Argus Media shows a nearly 50% surge in freight rates since the measures took effect. The difference between the price of Russian oil at export and its delivered price in Asia&#x2014;an indicator of shipping costs&#x2014;has also spiked. The number of sanctioned vessels has now reached 265, with U.S. blacklisting proving to be the most disruptive. Of the 435 ships that transported Russian crude in 2024, 112&#x2014;or 26%&#x2014;are now under Washington&#x2019;s sanctions, according to Bloomberg. When vessels sanctioned by the EU and U.K. are included, the figure rises to 37%. However, given that 80% of these tankers carried multiple shipments, the affected vessels were responsible for 57% of Russia&#x2019;s total seaborne crude exports last year. This presents a significant logistical hurdle for the Kremlin as it struggles to secure alternative shipping options. The growing restrictions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet mean the country must find new ways to sustain its oil export volumes. Some sanctioned ships have already encountered delays, either idling near Russian ports or waiting outside Chinese terminals instead of completing deliveries. Others have been used to transfer cargo to larger storage vessels near Russia&#x2019;s coastline. Freight costs have already surged, with the expense of shipping a barrel of Russian crude from the Black Sea to India now at $10, while transport from the Baltic costs as much as $13 per barrel. While these rates are not yet at the peak levels seen after the initial G7 price cap, they have jumped by 48% since Jan. 10. With Russian oil shipments becoming increasingly difficult, the country&#x2019;s ability to maintain its export levels may come under serious strain. If the recent shipping bottlenecks continue to expand, the sanctions could deal a severe blow to Russia&#x2019;s energy trade, exacerbating its economic challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-strain-russias-oil-exports-as-shipping-costs-surge-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-07T15:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229695308.jpg
Trump demands USAID shutdown as mass suspensions, layoffs begin	President Donald Trump called on Feb. 7 for the immediate closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), just hours before most of its staff faced suspension or layoffs. Writing on Truth Social, Trump accused the agency of widespread corruption and fraud, declaring, &quot;CLOSE IT DOWN!&quot; He had previously described USAID as being &quot;run by radical lunatics.&quot; The call to shut down USAID coincided with an expected wave of administrative leave notices and contract terminations. Most direct hires at the agency were set to be placed on indefinite leave, while contractors faced layoffs. A notice posted on USAID&#x2019;s website informed foreign service officers that the agency would pay for their return to the United States within 30 days, with limited case-by-case extensions available. Overnight, the agency modified its guidance, allowing foreign service officers to remain overseas at their own expense. A newly added FAQ on the USAID website clarified that those who chose to stay abroad would have to cover their own travel costs. However, it remained unclear whether they would continue receiving cost-of-living subsidies while on administrative leave. The abrupt changes left many foreign service officers scrambling to determine their next steps. The initial directive sparked widespread concern, as aid workers questioned how they could relocate their families on such short notice. The revised policy, while permitting them to stay, offered little reassurance to those facing potential job losses. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-demands-usaid-shutdown-as-mass-suspensions-layoffs-begin/	2025-02-07T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Let's do a deal' — Zelensky tells Reuters he's open to Trump's mineral partnership	President Volodymyr Zelensky is pushing for a deal with the United States that would grant American companies access to Ukraine&#x2019;s vast reserves of rare earth minerals in exchange for continued financial and military support. During an interview with Reuters on Feb. 7, Zelensky examined a once-classified map detailing the country&#x2019;s mineral wealth, highlighting its strategic importance. He emphasized that any agreement must include security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. The proposal aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s interest in securing Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earths and other critical minerals as part of ongoing support for Kyiv. Zelensky stressed that Ukraine was not offering to &quot;give away&quot; its resources but seeking a mutually beneficial partnership. &quot;The Americans helped the most, and therefore the Americans should earn the most,&quot; he said, adding that he hoped to discuss the issue directly with Trump. He also noted that Moscow had extensive knowledge of Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral wealth from Soviet-era geological surveys. According to Zelensky, less than 20% of Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources are under Russian occupation, including about half of its rare earth deposits. He warned that Russian allies such as North Korea and Iran could exploit these resources, reinforcing the urgency of securing Western investment. Ukraine holds Europe&#x2019;s largest reserves of titanium&#x2014;crucial for the aeronautics and space industries&#x2014;as well as significant uranium deposits. Zelensky also raised the prospect of using Ukraine&#x2019;s underground gas storage facilities to store U.S. liquefied natural gas, positioning the country as a key energy hub for Europe. Zelensky is set to attend the Munich Security Conference from Feb. 14-16, where he hopes to meet Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. He insisted that any U.S.-Russia discussions must include direct Ukrainian participation. &quot;Otherwise, it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; he said. The Ukrainian leader said his priority would be securing firm commitments on security guarantees before any negotiations with Moscow move forward. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have launched a new offensive in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, advancing 2.5 km (1.5 miles). Zelensky also confirmed that thousands of North Korean troops fighting for Russia had returned to active combat after a brief pause.	https://kyivindependent.com/lets-do-a-deal-zelensky-tells-reuters-hes-open-to-trumps-mineral-partnership/	2025-02-07T13:31:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013695.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean soldiers 'brought in again' to fight in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Key developments on Feb. 7: North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; by Russia to the embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Feb. 7. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi briefed Zelensky about new Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region. &quot;A significant number of occupiers have been eliminated, we are talking hundreds of Russian and North Korean servicemen,&quot; the president said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Ukraine&apos;s spy chief Kyrylo Budanov denied these reports. He said that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;A total of 60,000 Russian troops in Kursk Oblast are 60,000 that have not replenished the already significant occupier&apos;s forces in Pokrovsk and other sectors in our Donetsk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian guided aerial bomb near the front-line southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Feb. 7, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told Interfax-Ukraine. Guided aerial bombs (KABs), while having a shorter range than missiles, are cheaper to produce and are launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. They are nearly impossible to shoot down because they have heavy iron structures, and come in extremely fast from high altitudes, unlike cruise missiles or drones, according to experts. According to Ihnat, it was not the first time Ukraine downed a guided bomb. &quot;To counter this threat, we need a comprehensive approach &#x2014; both the use of ground-based air defense and aviation components to drive the carriers of these KABs as far as possible,&quot; the spokesperson said, without specifying how the target was shot down. His remarks came after Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian soldiers had down the guided aerial bomb on the morning of Feb. 7, allegedly using experimental weaponry. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security on Feb. 7 refuted media reports of Russia&apos;s alleged failed launch of its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, at Ukraine. The statement came after Forbes, citing Ukrainian soldier and blogger Kyrylo Sazonov, wrote that Russia launched another Oreshnik missile on Feb. 6 &quot;apparently targeting Kyiv.&quot; Sazonov claimed that the missile &quot;didn&apos;t fly far&quot; and exploded in Russia. &quot;The article in the U.S. media is based only on Sazonov&apos;s assumptions, not on actual data,&quot; the statement, published by the center that operates under Ukraine&apos;s Culture and Information Ministry, read. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially reported the launch of Oreshnik. U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to double down on the sanctions against Russia to pressure the Kremlin into ending its war against Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told The New York Post in an interview published on Feb. 6. According to Kellogg, current U.S. sanctions on Russia, particularly those targeting its energy sector, amount to a &quot;3 on a 10-point scale&quot; regarding economic pressure. He argued there is significant room to strengthen them further. &quot;You could really increase the sanctions &#x2014; especially the latest sanctions (targeting oil production and exports),&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;It&apos;s opened the aperture way high to do something.&quot; He added that Trump has already gathered his national security team, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to discuss a coordinated strategy to end the war. Kellogg criticized former President Joe Biden&apos;s approach of supporting Ukraine &quot;as long as it takes,&quot; calling it &quot;a bumper sticker, not a strategy.&quot; Kellogg emphasized that Trump&apos;s administration is focused on a &quot;holistic approach&quot; to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Trump&apos;s special envoy is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7.

Zelensky, Trump may meet in Washington next week	President Volodymyr Zelensky may meet with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump next week in Washington, Trump said on Feb. 7. &quot;I will probably be meeting with President Zelensky next week, and I will probably be talking to President (Vladimir) Putin. I&apos;d like to see the war end,&quot; said the American leader during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. He also said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments but added that no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. Trump and Zelensky are discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; according to the U.S. president. Previously, Trump said that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. Kyiv is open to mining with its partners, Zelensky said. It&#x2019;s unclear exactly what Trump meant by &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Ukraine is home to 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals, like titanium, used in the aerospace and defense industries, and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. &quot;We want security. Because as you know, Europe is putting up much less than us (the U.S.),&quot; Trump said. The meeting between Zelensky and Trump can take place as the U.S. prepares to present a long-awaited plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that the plan will be introduced by Trump, but did not specify a timeline.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-may-meet-in-washington-next-week/	2025-02-07T11:36:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361.jpg

As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers were fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, according to Budanov. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-brought-in-again-in-kursk-oblast-battles-zelensky-said/	2025-02-07T11:29:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599341.jpg
Russia designates Register of Damage against Ukraine as undesirable organization	Russia&#x2019;s Justice Ministry declared the Register of Damage Caused by Russian Aggression against Ukraine an &quot;undesirable organization&quot; on Feb. 7. This was announced on the Russian Justice Ministry&#x2019;s website. The register, established under the Council of Europe and based on a UN General Assembly resolution, aims to document war-related damage as a step toward compensating victims. This designation applies to foreign and international NGOs that Russian authorities view as a threat to national security or constitutional order. The Russian government designated a record 65 organizations as &quot;undesirable&quot; in 2024. There are now 187 organizations categorized as &quot;undesirable&quot; by the Russian government.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-designates-register-of-damage-against-ukraine-as-undesirable-organization/	2025-02-07T11:05:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-06-10.08.15.jpeg
Trump's ICC sanctions won't hinder Russian war crimes investigation, Kyiv says	The International Criminal Court (ICC) will continue to carry out its functions in holding Russia accountable for crimes committed during the full-scale war against Ukraine, regardless of U.S. sanctions, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Feb. 7 briefing. Tykhyi&apos;s statement came after President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on the ICC over probes targeting the U.S. and Israel. He ordered an asset freeze and a travel ban on the court&apos;s officials, staff and their families, as well as anyone who is believed to have assisted the ICC in its investigation. &quot;I think that the U.S. decisions are not related to the Ukrainian context, and we hope that they will not affect the court&apos;s ability to achieve justice and justice for the victims of Russian aggression,&quot; Tykhyi said. According to the spokesperson, Kyiv continues to work with the ICC to ensure that the investigation of Russian war crimes advances. Ukraine became the 125th state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Jan. 1. In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced deportations of at least tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-occupied territories. The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council who formerly served as defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for war crimes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/mks-prodovzhit-rozsliduvati-rosiiski-zlochini-v-ukrayini-pislia-sanktsii-trampa-kiyiv-kazhie/	2025-02-07T10:09:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
2 Ukrainian military officers appointed as deputy defense ministers	Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers appointed two new deputy ministers of defense on Feb. 7, Taras Melnychuk, the Cabinet&apos;s representative in parliament, announced. The deputy ministers are Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk and Captain Valerii Churkin. &quot;These decisions are part of a comprehensive approach to strengthening our Armed Forces, modernizing management, and advancing military technology,&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. The appointment came a week after Umerov faced backlash following his decision to fire Maryna Bezrukova, head of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). The minister replaced her with Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director, despite the agency&apos;s supervisory board voting to extend her contract days earlier. Umerov also dismissed Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov and two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr. In late January, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power, as well as office position by Umerov. Described as &quot;one of the most experienced officers&quot; in the Ukrainian army, Moysiuk served as the Air Assault Forces commander and was deputy to former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Moysiuk as special commissioner on implementation of the international security agreements. He will be in charge of the development of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, including mobilization and military training, Umerov said. Churkin, who joined the Armed Forces at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, is the head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. As deputy defense minister, he will focus on defense innovations and technological development of the Ukrainian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-officers-appointed-as-umerovs-deputies/	2025-02-07T09:06:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648104571.jpg
Ukraine expecting important decisions at Ramstein meeting, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is actively preparing and expects important decisions to be made at the upcoming Ramstein meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a press conference on Feb. 7. London will host the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) summit in Brussels on Feb. 12, rather than the U.S., the U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO confirmed on Feb. 6. &#x201C;We welcome that the British have now taken on this role of convening the Ramstein,&#x201D; Tykhyi said. He stated that decisions will likely be made about both air defense and investments in Ukrainian weapons production during the meeting. &#x201C;We consider the Ramstein to be an effective mechanism, an effective format that has proven its effectiveness over the years 2022-2024. Therefore, it is good that it continues to function,&#x201D; Tykhyi added. The UDCG, which includes more than 50 countries&#x2014;including all 32 NATO members&#x2014;typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Its last gathering on Jan. 9 marked the 25th meeting since the group was established in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expecting-important-decisions-at-ramstein-meeting-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-02-07T08:51:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1252040987.jpg
Police investigate death of 32-year-old man at military enlistment office	Chernivtsi Oblast&apos;s police said on Feb. 7 that they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a 32-year-old man at a regional military enlistment office. He was wanted for evading mobilization and agreed to visit the enlistment office to clarify his military registration details, according to the police. According to preliminary information, the man felt unwell and fainted during his medical examination. Police said they immediately provided first aid and called paramedics, but despite resuscitation efforts, doctors pronounced him dead at the scene. His body was sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of death. The incident follows reports on the deaths of conscripts allegedly caused by beatings at military enlistment offices. In June 2024 the Zhytomyr Oblast military enlistment office launched an investigation after Serhii Kovalchuk, 32, died following his stay at the Zviahel military enlistment office. Kovalchuk&apos;s relatives accused the military enlistment office of causing his death by beating him. Dozens of local residents protested against the enlistment office following the incident. Prosecutors opened a murder investigation into the incident. Military enlistment officials have denied the accusations, claiming that no violence was used against Kovalchuk. The incidents also come amid heightened security concerns following a series of attacks on military enlistment offices. On Feb. 1, a bombing at a draft office in Rivne killed the suspected perpetrator and injured eight service members. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later said Russia had recruited the attacker. Other recent attacks include explosions at recruitment centers in Rivne and Pavlohrad, which wounded several officers, and the Jan. 31 killing of a draft officer in Poltava Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have pledged to investigate the incidents and bring those responsible to justice.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-investigate-death-of-32-year-old-man-at-chernivtsi-recruitment-center/	2025-02-07T08:36:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/360088567_230475339937093_4720614111518600125_n.jpg
Kyiv denies reports of an alleged failed Russian Oreshnik missile launch at Ukraine	Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security on Feb. 7 refuted media reports of Russia&apos;s alleged failed launch of its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, at Ukraine. The statement came after Forbes, citing Ukrainian soldier and blogger Kyrylo Sazonov, wrote that the Russia has launched another Oreshnik missile on Feb. 6 &quot;apparently targeting Kyiv.&quot; Sazonov claimed that the missile &quot;didn&apos;t fly far&quot; and exploded in Russia. &quot;The article in the U.S. media is based only on Sazonov&apos;s assumptions, not on actual data,&quot; the statement, published by the center that operates under Ukraine&apos;s Culture and Information Ministry, read. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially reported the launch of Oreshnik. Russia launched the Oreshnik against Ukraine once following Kyiv&apos;s first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia last November. Moscow later acknowledged additional ATACMS strikes on targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts. The missile, launched at Dnipro, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that only a few air defense systems can repel the Oreshnik, and Ukraine does not yet possess these capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-denies-reports-of-an-allegedly-failed-russian-oreshnik-missile-launch-at-kyiv/	2025-02-07T08:00:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Bucha massacre suspect becomes top official in Russian region	Nursultan Mussagaleyev, a former Russian army commander suspected of involvement in war crimes, has been appointed as an acting deputy minister for regional and information policy in Russia&apos;s Orenburg Oblast, Denis Pasler, the region&apos;s governor, said on Telegram on Feb. 6. As a platoon commander at the 76th Airborne Assault Division, Mussagaleyev allegedly participated in Russia&apos;s brutal occupation of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, in February and March 2022, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Hundreds of civilians were massacred by Russian troops in Bucha at the time. The SBU has identified him as having taken part in so-called &quot;purge operations,&quot; which aimed to suppress resistance and intimidate civilians. Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, became a symbol of Russian war crimes after mass graves were uncovered in April 2022 following its liberation by Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has documented over 1,400 civilian killings in the Bucha District, including 637 in Bucha itself. Among the victims were 37 children. Many were executed, their bodies left on the streets or buried in mass graves. Mussagaleyev was later honored by Russia&apos;s military and political leadership. He was awarded the &quot;Hero of Russia&quot; star and the &quot;Military Distinction&quot; medal. Russian state television glorified his role in the invasion, broadcasting a feature about him on the state-run Russia 1 channel. His appointment to a government position in Orenburg Oblast follows a broader trend in Russia of rewarding military personnel linked to war crimes with prestigious roles in civilian administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/bucha-massacre-suspect-appointed-to-deputy-minister-in-russias-orenburg-oblast/	2025-02-07T07:43:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2022-04-img-9105-1024x663.jpg
A night with Ukraine’s Vampire drone team near Kurakhove	In the new age of drones ushered in by Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, UAVs of all shapes and sizes, from large fixed-wing reconnaissance drones to small kamikaze quadcopters have a specialized role to play. One design, the Ukrainian Vampire heavy bomber drone, has stood out in its effectiveness and versatility, able to drop not only large bombs and mines on the enemy, but also much-needed supplies for Ukrainian troops. The Kyiv Independent spent a night shift with a Vampire team fighting between Kurakhove and Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the hottest part of the front line, on a mine-laying mission.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-night-with-ukraines-vampire-drone-team-near-kurakhove/	2025-02-07T07:08:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5273895809975342109.jpg
Russia to expand seizure of foreign assets, Reuters reports	The Russian government is planning to expand its authority to seize the frozen assets of companies and investors from countries that have sanctioned Moscow over its war against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 7, citing sources familiar with the matter. A draft law approved this week by the Russian government&apos;s legislative commission lays out the procedure for seizing foreign property in retaliation for freezing Russian assets abroad. The legislation follows a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May 2024, which allows the government to identify U.S. property and securities as compensation for losses caused by Western asset freezes. The process would involve lawsuits filed by the Russian authorities, including the central bank and the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A source told Reuters that C-type accounts &#x2014; holding funds belonging to foreign investors but blocked unless authorized by Moscow &#x2014; could be at risk. This could impact individuals and large U.S. investment funds with billions of dollars trapped in Russia. The move comes as the U.S. and European allies seek to use frozen Russian assets to finance aid for Ukraine. The U.S. government is considering using proceeds from these assets to purchase American weapons for Kyiv, Trump administration envoy Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Jan. 24. Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, though they can only access an estimated $3.2 billion in annual profits. These earnings will help finance a $50 billion G7 loan to Ukraine, with the European Union contributing &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) to the initiative and the U.S. adding $20 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-advancing-legal-changes-to-confiscate-western-assets-reuters-reports/	2025-02-07T07:03:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Ukraine downs Russian guided bomb near Zaporizhzhia, Air Force says	Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian guided aerial bomb near the front-line southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Feb. 7, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told Interfax-Ukraine.

Russia regularly attacks Ukrainian front-line settlements with guided bombs. Over the past week, a total of 760 such bombs were launched at Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Russian glide bombs killed 360 Ukrainian civilians in 2024, and injured 1,861, a threefold increase in fatalities, and a sixfold increase in injuries compared to 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-4/	2025-02-07T06:59:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193050137.jpg
Syria to reassess Russian military presence 'based on national interests,' may seek Assad's extradition	Syria&apos;s new government will decide the fate of Russian military bases based on national interests, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told The Washington Post on Feb. 6. Russia&apos;s ability to retain its naval base in Tartus and airbase in Khmeimim will depend on what Moscow offers in return, Abu Qasra indicated. &quot;If we benefit Syria from it, yes,&quot; he said. Following the overthrow of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. The new government has reportedly requested that Russia hand over Assad and his close aides, Reuters reported on Jan. 28, citing a Syrian source familiar with the negotiations. The demand was raised during initial talks between Syrian officials and a Russian delegation, which took place shortly after Assad fled to Moscow. While Abu Qasra did not confirm whether transitional President Ahmad al-Sharaa formally asked for Assad&apos;s extradition, he noted that any future relations with Russia must serve Syria&apos;s interests first. Relations between Moscow and Syria&apos;s new government have &quot;significantly improved,&quot; the defense minister said, despite Russia&apos;s past support for Assad, including airstrikes against opposition forces during their rapid advance on major cities in late 2024. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to bolster Assad&apos;s regime, which used Moscow&apos;s backing to suppress opposition through mass imprisonment, torture, and executions. During the Jan. 28 talks, Syria&apos;s new leadership pressed Russia to acknowledge &quot;past mistakes&quot; and offer compensation, but the Russian delegation refused to concede, according to a Reuters source. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new government on the issue. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi later said Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on Russia&apos;s military presence, though details were not disclosed. Given al-Sharaa&apos;s past ties to al Qaeda, Western officials have remained cautious about the transitional president&apos;s intentions as he attempts to rebuild a war-torn society. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X on Jan. 27, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-to-reassess-russian-military-bases-may-demand-assads-extradition/	2025-02-07T06:30:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187892433.jpg
Zelensky to push for 'lasting and sustainable peace' at Munich conference	President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation to the Munich Security Conference next week, Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. Yermak noted that the Ukrainian delegation will present the country&apos;s position on ending the war and its vision of achieving a &quot;lasting and sustainable peace.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s necessary that the leaders and the experts in politics who will be in Munich realize that this is momentum. That we are very near to really ending this war by a just and lasting peace, but (it&apos;s) necessary to be together,&quot; he told the Associated Press. The Munich Security Conference will also be attended by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. While Bloomberg reported on Feb. 5 that Trump&apos;s team might present a peace plan, Kellogg denied this on Feb. 6, saying that no such plan would be unveiled in Munich. Ukraine is preparing to host Kellogg on Feb. 20, following the Munich conference, according to sources in the President&apos;s Office cited by RBC-Ukraine. The annual conference comes at a pivotal moment for Ukraine. Kyiv strives to establish a relationship with the new U.S. administration, a key partner during the nearly three-year Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-lead-ukrainian-delegation-at-munich-security-conference-push-for-lasting-and-sustainable-peace/	2025-02-07T06:26:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukraine secures preliminary deals to replace USAID funding for critical projects, official says	Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects. She also noted that the European Commission and Group of Seven (G7) countries are expected to announce a decision on resuming the work of commissions responsible for appointing key members of Ukraine&apos;s judiciary and anti-corruption institutions in the coming days. Due to the suspension of USAID&apos;s operations in Ukraine, several commissions involved in judicial selections have either halted work or faced operational issues. &quot;As far as I know, the contracts have been terminated, and we must reassemble this puzzle,&quot; Stefanishyna said, stressing the need for international partners to uphold their joint responsibility in supporting Ukraine&apos;s reforms. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Trump&apos;s administration is reportedly planning to eliminate most positions at USAID, The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Trump appointed as acting administrator of USAID, reiterated on Feb. 4 that U.S. foreign aid must serve American interests rather than function as &quot;charity.&quot; Billionaire Elon Musk, now head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump agreed to shut it down.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-preliminary-deals-to-replace-usaid-funding-for-critical-projects-senior-official-says/	2025-02-07T06:13:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166979167.jpg
37 Ukrainian MPs visit US to strengthen bilateral relations, speaker says	Thirty-seven Ukrainian lawmakers have traveled to the United States at their own expense to strengthen ties with U.S. officials, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said on Feb. 7. &quot;Ukraine is facing a critical task &#x2014; to restart our relations with our strategic partner, the United States. And we are doing this systematically at all levels, including restoring relations with the U.S. Congress,&quot; Stefanchuk said. His comments come after President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 6 criticized lawmakers for frequent foreign trips, including a visit to the U.S. for the National Prayer Breakfast. Stefanchuk emphasized that the delegation, composed of both opposition members and representatives from the ruling party, is working with U.S. senators to rebuild political relationships. &quot;All the lawmakers are there not at the expense of the state; they went at their own expense,&quot; Stefanchuk said. He assured that the work of the Verkhovna Rada would not be disrupted, noting that parliamentary duties extend beyond voting in plenary sessions to include committee work, investigations, and diplomatic engagement. Amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s current parliamentary convocation has been operating longer than any in the country&apos;s history.	https://kyivindependent.com/37-ukrainian-lawmakers-visit-us-to-strengthen-strategic-relations-stefanchuk-announces/	2025-02-07T05:52:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1722127186.jpg
Bulgaria to receive $519 million compensation for Ukraine military aid	Bulgaria will receive around 500 million euros ($519.5 million) from Kyiv&apos;s biggest donors in compensation for its military aid to Ukraine, the European news site Euractiv reported on Feb. 7. &quot;By helping Ukraine, we are actually helping ourselves,&quot; Bulgarian Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov said. Sofia has already received 174 million euros ($180 million) from Denmark under two contracts related to military aid for Ukraine. Authorities expect at least another 300 million euros ($311 million) from the U.S. and the European Commission as compensation for sending military equipment to Kyiv. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with old Soviet-era military equipment, with funds received from NATO and EU allies being reinvested into purchasing modern Western weapons. The country had already sent six military aid packages, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and defective air defense missiles that can be used for spare parts, Zapryanov said. While the Bulgarian government does not disclose specific details about what is being sent, it is known that a significant portion consists of ammunition and missiles for Ukraine&apos;s S-300 air defense systems. In 2024, Bulgaria also sent 150 armored vehicles and Soviet-made &quot;Gvozdika&quot; self-propelled howitzers. Despite the financial and strategic benefits for Bulgaria&apos;s military, pro-Russian forces in the country continue to oppose sending aid to Ukraine. Kostadin Kostadinov, leader of Bulgaria&apos;s pro-Russian Revival party, echoed Kremlin narratives on Jan. 11, claiming that Southern Bessarabia, part of Ukraine&apos;s Odesa Oblast, should be &quot;returned&quot; to Bulgaria. Posting on Facebook, Kostadinov argued that &quot;Ukraine is falling apart&quot; and that Bulgarians are the &quot;indigenous population&quot; of the region, with historical ties predating Ukraine&apos;s control of the territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/actually-helping-ourselves-bulgaria-to-receive-519-million-compensation-for-ukraine-military-aid/	2025-02-07T05:14:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Three killed, five injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 7. Overnight, Russia launched 112 Shahed combat drones and decoy drones, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 81 drones over nine oblasts, while 31 others were lost without causing damage, according to the Air Force. In Kherson Oblast, Russian shelling killed one person and wounded five others, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Two high-rise buildings and six private houses were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, a Russian attack destroyed a two-story apartment building, the regional military administration said. Preliminary reports indicate that two people were killed, with their bodies found during rubble removal. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces carried out 339 strikes on 14 settlements. The attacks damaged apartments, private homes, and vehicles, though no civilian casualties were reported, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian troops launched seven attacks on localities, damaging over 14 buildings. No casualties were reported, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Ukraine has endured daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities consistently reporting casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-killed-5-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-07T04:23:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-07_08-51-07.jpg
Trump ready to step up Russia sanctions to end war in Ukraine, special envoy says	U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to double down on the sanctions against Russia to pressure the Kremlin into ending its war against Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told The New York Post in an interview published on Feb. 6. According to Kellogg, current U.S. sanctions on Russia, particularly those targeting its energy sector, amount to a &quot;3 on a 10-point scale&quot; regarding economic pressure. He argued there is significant room to strengthen them further. &quot;You could really increase the sanctions &#x2014; especially the latest sanctions (targeting oil production and exports),&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;It&apos;s opened the aperture way high to do something.&quot; He added that Trump has already gathered his national security team, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to discuss a coordinated strategy to end the war. Kellogg criticized former President Joe Biden&apos;s approach of supporting Ukraine &quot;as long as it takes,&quot; calling it &quot;a bumper sticker, not a strategy.&quot; Kellogg emphasized that Trump&apos;s administration is focused on a &quot;holistic approach&quot; to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Trump&apos;s special envoy is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. Trump previously said on Feb. 5 that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia were progressing, though he did not provide specifics. Kellogg confirmed on Feb. 6 that Washington would not present a specific plan to end the war at the upcoming Munich Security Conference but reiterated Trump&apos;s goal of reaching a &quot;near-term resolution&quot; within 100 days of his inauguration. The Trump administration is weighing whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent settlement. Kellogg has suggested using frozen Russian assets to fund American arms supplies to Ukraine, an idea he first floated on Jan. 24. Zelensky said on Jan. 26 that diplomacy could be key to ending the war, suggesting that the Trump administration might accelerate the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-ready-to-double-russia-sanctions-to-end-war-in-ukraine-kellogg-says/	2025-02-07T02:40:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
Ukraine to host Trump's envoy Kellogg in February, top official says	Ukraine is preparing to host U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. &quot;It is very important for President Volodymyr Zelensky and our team that the new U.S. administration receives full, realistic information about the situation on the battlefield as soon as possible,&quot; Yermak said. Yermak emphasized that Kyiv wants Washington to be fully informed about Ukraine&apos;s mobilization efforts, as well as the supply of weapons and equipment. &quot;Communication is important for developing a common position with partners because it is impossible to formulate any plans to achieve peace without Ukraine,&quot; he added. Yermak has already spoken with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and further contacts with other Trump administration officials are expected. He reiterated that Ukraine must approach negotiations from a position of strength and secure guarantees to prevent another Russian invasion. Ukrainian officials are finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Trump&apos;s return to office, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a Feb. 4 press briefing in Kyiv. Kellogg was initially expected to visit before Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, but the trip was postponed for legal reasons, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said in January. Talking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed that Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war that entails &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering positive initiatives for both. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/to-receive-full-realistic-information-ukraine-to-host-trumps-envoy-kellogg-in-february-yermak-says/	2025-02-07T01:28:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Czechia extends protection for Ukrainians, tightens rules for Russian applicants	Czech President Petr Pavel signed a law on Feb. 6 to extend the protection period for Ukrainian refugees, the Czech news site &#x10C;esk&#xE9; Noviny reported. The law also criminalizes unauthorized activities in favor of a foreign state and tightens requirements for Russian applicants seeking citizenship. Under the new provisions, temporary protection for Ukrainian refugees, set to expire in March, will be extended for another year in line with an EU-wide decision. This status allows refugees fleeing Russian aggression to access public healthcare, education, and employment opportunities in Czechia. The amended law also introduces a pathway for long-term residence permits for Ukrainian refugees who have lived in Czechia for over two years. Eligibility is conditional on financial independence, stable housing, and, for children, enrollment in a Czech school. The law also imposes criminal liability for unauthorized activities conducted in favor of a foreign state, with penalties ranging from up to five years in peacetime to a maximum of 15 years during martial law. New restrictions require Russian nationals seeking Czech citizenship to renounce their Russian citizenship and provide official proof of doing so. Exceptions will apply in specific cases, such as for asylum seekers. The legislative changes come as Czechia plays a key role in supporting Ukraine militarily. Prague unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners in early 2024 amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. A similar procurement plan for 2025 is also in development, according to Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-extends-refugee-status-for-ukrainians-tightens-rules-for-russian-applicants/	2025-02-07T00:07:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252537011.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 846,650 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 846,650 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 7. This number includes 1,340 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,975 tanks, 20,755 armored fighting vehicles, 36,307 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,785 artillery systems, 1,271 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,056 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,301 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-846-650-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-06T23:46:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
Trump imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court through executive order	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Feb. 6. The sanctions could involve freezing assets and banning ICC officials and their families from entering the U.S. Trump&#x2019;s order claimed that the ICC&#x2019;s &#x201C;illegitimate actions set a dangerous precedent&#x201D; and that this endangers U.S. citizens and military personnel. The order also said that the ICC has overstepped its jurisdiction and &#x201C;abused its power&#x201D; in targeting U.S. and allied officials. Ukraine became the 125th state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Jan. 1. In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced deportations of at least tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-occupied territories. The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council who formerly served as defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for war crimes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court-through-executive-order/	2025-02-06T22:00:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
Slovakia resumes gas imports from Russia via TurkStream pipeline	Slovak gas company SPP began importing Russian gas again through the TurkStream pipeline on Feb. 1, with plans to double supplies by April, Slovak news agency TASR reported on Feb. 6. SPP Chairman Vojtech Ferencz confirmed that the company still has a contract with Gazprom, citing the lower transit fees compared to other suppliers. The pipeline goes through Turkey and Hungary, eventually reaching Slovakia. However, Michal Lalik, head of SPP&#x2019;s trade division, noted that Slovakia would still need additional imports from other routes, as the current imports cannot fully meet demand. Slovakia&#x2019;s gas needs in January were mainly met using domestic reserves, which remain above average. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Following Ukraine&#x2019;s decision, Fico threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-resumes-gas-imports-from-russia-via-turkstream-pipeline/	2025-02-06T19:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Trump administration suspends task force targeting assets of Russian oligarchs	The U.S. Justice Department is shutting down a program that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs, launched in 2022, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Feb. 5. In Bondi&#x2019;s memo, she stated that the program known as &#x201C;Task Force KleptoCapture&#x201D; will be discontinued, as the priority of the Trump administration is combatting drug cartels and international gangs. Initiated under former U.S. President Joe Biden, the program aimed to financially pressure wealthy allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and penalize those involved in sanctions evasion. While ongoing cases against Russian oligarchs will continue, the task force will no longer be centrally managed at the Justice Department. The changes will take effect for at least 90 days, with the possibility of becoming permanent. The task force previously seized assets from individuals such as Tsargrad TV channel owner Konstantin Malofeyev and Dagestani senator and billionaire Suleyman Kerimov. A civil forfeiture complaint against Malofeyev was first filed in the U.S. on Nov. 30, 2022, and prosecutors threatened to seize $5.4 million. Similarly, in April 2022 the U.S. seized Kerimov&apos;s $300 million superyacht and sanctioned his family and associates later that year.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-suspends-task-force-targeting-assets-of-russian-oligarchs/	2025-02-06T18:49:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Healthy' democracies can hold elections in wartime, Kellogg says	Ukraine will &quot;reach a point&quot; where it must hold elections in order to maintain the health of its democracy, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on Feb. 6. Kellogg previously said on Feb. 1 that Ukraine should aim to hold presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of the year. &quot;You&apos;re gonna reach a point where they&apos;re gonna have to have elections, and that&apos;s a sign of a healthy democracy,&quot; Kellogg said during an interview with Newsmax TV on Feb. 6. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean (President Volodymyr) Zelensky should leave,&quot; he clarified. Kellogg acknowledged that elections cannot take place immediately, as Ukraine&apos;s constitution prevents elections during martial law. Still, he asserted that the ability to hold a vote amid war indicated a well-functioning democracy. &quot;A sign of a healthy democracy is the willingness and the ability to have an election even in a time of war,&quot; he said. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on Feb. 4 that Ukraine will not hold elections until after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends. &quot;We will be very happy if elections are held in Ukraine because it will mean that we have won this war,&quot; she said. Under martial law, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned in Ukraine. If martial law had not been imposed, a presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Ukraine does not currently have the appropriate infrastructure or mechanisms to organize elections that guarantee all citizens&apos; electoral and political rights, according to the Ukrainian Civil Network Opora. The damage to Ukraine&apos;s electoral infrastructure stems in part from Russia&apos;s continued attacks. Zelensky said on Jan. 2 that parliament can set a date for elections as soon as the hot stage of Russia&apos;s war ends and martial law is lifted. Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014;&#xA0;an autocratic leader who has held power in Russia for over 20 years &#x2014;&#xA0;has sought to use Ukraine&apos;s delayed elections as a pretense to undermine Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy. The Kremlin-driven narrative has been repeated by far-right commentators in the U.S. Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s plans to end the war, is expected to visit Ukraine later in February for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/healthy-democracies-can-hold-elections-in-wartime-kellogg-says/	2025-02-06T16:30:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Trump to lay off nearly all USAID staff worldwide, NYT reports	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to eliminate the majority of the positions at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 6, citing three people with knowledge of the plans. The cuts will reduce the agency from 10,000 staff worldwide to just 290, sources said. The announcement comes after the Trump administration issued a directive on Feb. 4 saying that all USAID employees will be placed on administrative leave starting Feb. 7. The administration informed USAID officials on Feb. 6 that it was canceling around 800 awards and contracts administered via the agency, the NYT sources said. The three people were granted anonymity as they are not authorized to publicly discuss the cuts. The 290 remaining employees include those specializing in health and humanitarian assistance, the sources said. Trump&apos;s attacks on USAID began from his first day in office. A Jan. 20 executive order imposed a 90-day freeze on all U.S. foreign assistance, including vital humanitarian aid projects in Ukraine. The agency has since been subsumed by the U.S. State Department, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio taking over as acting administrative director. Lawmakers from the Democratic party protested the move, calling it &quot;illegal.&quot; Rubio assured reporters on Feb. 4 that the U.S. was &quot;not going to eliminate foreign aid.&quot; Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. Since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. The funding has supported rebuilding schools, financing bomb shelters, and equipping hospitals with advanced medical equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-lay-off-nearly-all-usaid-staff-worldwide-nyt-reports/	2025-02-06T15:17:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Russian singer who spoke out against war in Ukraine dies after allegedly falling from window during police raid	Russian singer-songwriter Vadim Stroykin died on Feb. 6 while security officials were raiding his apartment, the Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info reported. Stroykin reportedly fell out of a window while officers were visiting his home as part of a criminal investigation into the singer&apos;s alleged donation to Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this report. Russian media claimed that Stroykin withdrew to another room while officers were raiding his St. Petersburg apartment. He then fell out of a 10th-floor window and reportedly died at the scene. At least one Russian outlet has referred to his death as a &quot;suicide.&quot; Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has reportedly launched an investigation into Stroykin&apos;s death. Stroykin previously spoke out against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the social media website VKontakte in 2022. His posts condemned the war and criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since the 2022 invasion, a number of prominent Russian figures have mysteriously died after falling from windows. Acclaimed Russian ballet dancer Vladimir Shklyarov, who also denounced the war in Ukraine, died in November 2024 after allegedly falling from his fifth-floor apartment. Shklyarov&apos;s death was reported as an &quot;accident.&quot; Russia has also detained and imposed harsh prison sentences against citizens for publicly criticizing the war or donating small sums of money to Ukrainian charities &#x2014;&#xA0;acts that are now considered treason under the Russian criminal code.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-singer-who-spoke-out-against-war-in-ukraine-dies-after-allegedly-falling-from-window-during-police-raid/	2025-02-06T14:14:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/stroykin-1.jpeg
More Russian soldiers died near Pokrovsk in January than in entire Second Chechen War, military says	Russia lost more soldiers in the Pokrovsk sector in Ukraine during the month of January than its total losses in the Second Chechen War, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said during a television broadcast on Feb. 6. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. Trehubov reiterated these numbers in his report, comparing the casualties to Russia&apos;s 10-year military campaign against Chechnya. &quot;The Second Chechen War for the Russians for the entire period &#x2014; 6,000 dead,&quot; he said. &quot;That is, under Pokrovsk alone in January the Russians have more dead than in the entire Second Chechen War.&quot; Russia launched the Second Chechen War in August 1999, marking its second and ultimately successful attempt to suppress Chechen rebels in the North Caucasus republic. International human rights groups condemned the Russian military for purposely targeting civilians and committing war crimes throughout the decade-long conflict. The total losses incurred by Russian forces in the Second Chechen War are difficult to verify, though official government figures claim the number is around 6,000. Moscow is now seeing staggering losses in its ongoing assault against eastern Ukraine, with some reports indicating that over 1,000 soldiers are killed or wounded per day. Russian forces continue to sacrifice high numbers of personnel for limited territorial gains &#x2014;&#xA0;a grim tactic that can push back significantly outnumbered Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 845,310 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction. Trehubov said that Russia launched 24 assaults against Pokrovsk over the past day, but that Ukraine continues to hold the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-russian-soldiers-died-near-pokrovsk-in-january-than-in-entire-second-chechen-war-military-says/	2025-02-06T13:11:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2174987136-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: First French Mirage fighter jets arrive in Ukraine	Key developments on Feb. 6: The first French Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets pledged to Kyiv have arrived in Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Feb. 6. &quot;On June 6, 2024, (French President) Emmanuel Macron announced the delivery of French Mirage 2000 to Ukraine. The first of these arrived in Ukraine today,&quot; Lecornu said in a post on social media. &quot;With Ukrainian pilots trained for several months in France on board, they will now participate in defending Ukraine&apos;s sky,&quot; he added. Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. In a further boost on Feb.6, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced the first Dutch F-16 fighter jets had also arrived. &quot;These modern combat vehicles are already in Ukraine and will soon begin performing combat missions, strengthening our defense and ability to effectively resist Russian aggression,&quot; he said in a post on social media. Ukraine&apos;s armed forces have reportedly launched a new offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian media claimed on Feb. 6. According to Russian military bloggers, Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked southeast of Sudzha, advancing toward the settlements of Fanaseevka and Ulanok. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukraine deployed up to two mechanized battalions for the offensive. As a result of alleged fighting, a gas pipeline was damaged in the Rylskyi district, Kursk Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the reported offensive. The possible operation follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks on Feb. 5 that Ukraine&apos;s presence in Kursk Oblast could play an &quot;important part&quot; in future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war. Ukraine struck the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai with drones overnight on Feb. 6, the General Staff reported. &quot;Confirmed hit and explosions in the target area. A fire has broken out. The results of the hit are being clarified,&quot; the statement reads. The airfield, located 230 kilometers (142 miles) from the front line, is a key launch site for Russian Shahed-type drones used against Ukraine, the General Staff said, adding it also serves as a storage, training, and maintenance facility for aircraft operating in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts. Russian local Telegram channels reported explosions near the airfield following the strike. &quot;Strikes on the facilities involved in ensuring Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine and terrorizing the civilian population will continue,&quot; the General Staff added. Washington will not present a plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said on Feb. 6. Speaking to Newsmax TV, Kellogg denied media reports that he would introduce such a plan at the conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Kellogg said the plan would be presented by U.S. President Donald Trump but did not specify a timeline. &quot;We are going to lead it up to him to help him out, get it to a point where he delivers that, but that is not going to happen next week at all,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;We are going to have great discussions with senior leaders in the European environment and bring back what we found out to the President of the United States and then go from there.&quot; Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the full-scale invasion, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. &quot;We are aware of the enemy&apos;s plans, which envisage 210,000 unmanned systems troops in 277 military units by 2030,&quot; Syrskyi said. The statement follows Syrskyi&apos;s monthly meeting on drone warfare, where he reviewed Ukraine&apos;s use of unmanned systems in January 2025. Syrskyi claimed improving coordination between drone units and conventional military forces from reports from brigades and battalions. According to Syrsyi, 66% of Russian equipment destroyed in January resulted from various types of attack drones. The number of targets hit by drones increased by 7% compared to December, with Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones responsible for 49% of all damage inflicted.

Trump has no official plan to end Russia's war against Ukraine, Zelensky says	U.S. President Donald Trump does not have an official plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;There is no official plan yet. What is in certain publications... I am sure that this is not President Trump&apos;s official plan,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump&apos;s designated envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has set a goal of resolving the war within 100 days. Reports suggested that the U.S. plan would be unveiled at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14-16, but Kellogg denied this, stating that Trump would introduce the plan first. He did not provide a timeline. Zelensky indicated that he has an understanding of the plan&#x2019;s direction, having discussed some details with U.S. officials before Trump&apos;s inauguration. &quot;Our teams will work together, there can be no plan separately from anyone, even from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Let&apos;s wait for our official negotiations and official results,&quot; he added. Kellogg said Trump would seek a resolution acceptable to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In early February, Trump claimed that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. He also threatened sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports if a peace deal was not reached soon. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&apos;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. However, as Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-has-no-official-plan-to-end-russias-war-yet-zelensky/	2025-02-06T11:50:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195875052.jpg
Kyivstar secures approval to acquire Uklon in multimillion-dollar deal	The Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMCU) approved Kyivstar&#x2019;s acquisition of taxi service Uklon on Feb. 6, Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov announced at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Ukraine. AMCU head Pavlo Kyrylenko said Kyivstar will also acquire Tech Uklon LLC, Uklon Corporate, and Uklon Ukraine. &quot;The committee concluded that Kyivstar&#x2019;s actions will not lead to structural changes in any of the three affected markets: online advertising, passenger transportation, and goods delivery,&quot; Kyrylenko said. Forbes Ukraine reported on Jan. 27 that Kyivstar had filed an application with Ukraine&#x2019;s antitrust regulator to purchase Uklon, estimating the deal&apos;s value at $40&#x2013;80 million. Uklon generated Hr 1.2 billion ($28 million) in revenue during the first three quarters of 2023, doubling its earnings from the same period the previous year. However, the company has struggled to expand internationally, facing tough competition from Uber and Bolt. Veon, Kyivstar&#x2019;s parent company, brings capital, expertise, and access to other markets, one market insider told Forbes. In January, Veon announced plans to list Kyivstar on Nasdaq, with Komarov suggesting this could happen in the third quarter of 2025. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyivstar has invested Hr 32 billion ($772 million) into the company. At the end of 2024, Kyivstar also signed an agreement to make Ukraine one of the first countries with access to Starlink&apos;s direct-to-cell service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-leading-phone-operator-kyivstar-allowed-to-buy-uklon/	2025-02-06T10:02:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1842489660.jpg
Kyiv Independent raises over $66,200 to support Ukrainian newsrooms hit by US aid freeze	The Kyiv Independent has raised over $66,200 to support three Ukrainian newsrooms affected by the U.S. freeze on foreign aid. A GoFundMe campaign launched on Jan. 30 quickly surpassed its initial goal of 40,000 pounds ($50,000) within days. Now closed, the campaign&#x2019;s funds are being distributed to the impacted media outlets. &quot;I&apos;ve never had any doubts that our audience shares our values, but the generous support of our readers was even beyond my expectations! I want to thank everyone who joined our effort to help our colleagues in the front-line regions &#x2014; donated or shared our fundraiser with their communities,&quot; said Kyiv Independent CEO Daryna Shevchenko. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days to review their alignment with his administration&#x2019;s policies. The freeze has affected numerous humanitarian and media organizations in Ukraine, including local newsrooms providing critical coverage in war-affected areas. The funds raised will be equally distributed among three front-line newsrooms: &quot;The raised funds will help us to survive this transition period and continue our work &#x2014; from daily news to investigative journalism and the implementation of concrete changes in the city,&quot; Dmytro Tishchenko, CEO of Tsukr, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This support from our colleagues will help us to keep our team and all areas of work while we build a sustainable model of existence through the community, business, and European partners.&quot; These three newsrooms operate in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most dangerous regions. Thanks to the campaign&#x2019;s donors, they can continue paying their journalists and providing crucial reporting. The Kyiv Independent clarified that its own operations were not affected by the U.S. aid freeze, as it no longer receives U.S. taxpayer-funded grants. While it previously benefited from such support in 2022 and 2023, the outlet now sustains itself primarily through small monthly donations from its community.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-raises-over-66-200-to-support-ukrainian-newsrooms-hit-by-us-aid-freeze/	2025-02-06T09:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1239705530.jpg
French trade chief says Paris involved in rare earths research in Ukraine, adds US not a competitor	French point man for foreign trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, came to Kyiv during a turbulent time. As U.S. aid to Ukraine was drying up, President Donald Trump had made public his desire to get a hold of Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in return for a new influx of American support. The idea of trading Ukrainian raw resources in exchange for aid was seen as a favorable scenario by Kyiv, desperate to keep the flow of military hardware into the country. Yet, the unilateral claim by Trump didn&#x2019;t sit well with European counterparts, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling Trump&#x2019;s statement &quot;very egoistic, very self-centered.&quot; While in Kyiv on Feb. 5, Saint-Martin selected grants for reconstruction projects in the fields of health, infrastructure, energy, demining and agriculture that would benefit from the &#x20AC;200 million grant fund and spoke with the Kyiv Independent about rebuilding Ukraine, extraction of rare earth minerals in the country, and a potential trade war between Kyiv&#x2019;s closest allies. Kyiv Independent: Mr. Saint-Martin, can you please summarize your visit? Laurent Saint-Martin: My role as foreign trade minister has a dual purpose. The first is to reaffirm France&#x2019;s support for Ukraine in a complex global context &#x2014; military, diplomatic, but also economic and commercial support. The second goal is to show that France and Europe continue to support Ukraine in mutual economic projects, benefiting both France and the European Union, and Ukraine by developing joint investment projects. Kyiv Independent: You mention a dual interest, particularly in a context where Donald Trump conditions American aid on commercial profits he could benefit from here, in Ukraine. How can we ensure Ukraine benefits from this as well? Laurent Saint-Martin: Ukraine is in a process of accession to the European Union. This process echoes the discussions we had at the Warsaw industry and trade meeting on Feb. 4, regarding the integration of Ukrainian companies in Europe and investments in Ukraine, whether foreign or Ukrainian. The aim is to integrate these investments into European value chains, offering competitive advantages. This requires investments in sectors like infrastructure, digital technology, and energy decarbonization. France has the expertise and solutions to address these needs. Kyiv Independent: In which areas can France offer something more than other Ukraine allies, including the United States? Laurent Saint-Martin: In areas like low-carbon energy production, France and Europe have a considerable advantage over other countries. The question is whether our companies, both large and small, have the capacity to provide solutions suited to Ukraine&#x2019;s specific challenges and to integrate these solutions into European chains. This requires appropriate financial instruments to enable these investments. Minister delegate for Foreign Trade Laurent Saint-Martin signs agreements with Ukrainian counterparts on Feb. 5, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Emmanuelle Chaze/The Kyiv Independent)We&apos;ve mentioned the 200 million euro aid fund and concessional loans in the infrastructure sector. These are tools that will help support the implementation of these projects. Kyiv Independent: Regarding French companies, can you provide specific examples of those that have established themselves in Ukraine? Laurent Saint-Martin: We have a network of French companies that have been present in Ukraine for a long time, many of which have remained active. France is the largest foreign employer in Ukraine, with around 25,000 employees. This is a significant asset, particularly in sectors like financial services, which are very important for local employment. There are also projects like the one by Xavier Niel, with a &#x20AC;1 billion investment in the telecommunications sector. We also support companies in the energy, water, and infrastructure sectors. Kyiv Independent: The issue of exploiting rare materials in Ukraine is currently being discussed, following Donald Trump&#x2019;s statements. What is France&#x2019;s position on this? Laurent Saint-Martin: France has been working with Ukraine on rare mineral exploitation for a long time, with French experts from organizations like BRGM and the inter-ministerial Direction for Rare Mineral Supply. These actors are already involved in projects. Of course, many of these resources are in occupied areas, but there are also many resources in the territories controlled by Ukraine. France remains fully involved in this sector, and we continue discussions with Ukrainian authorities. Kyiv Independent: And in that particular field, what is the added value of France? Laurent Saint-Martin: I believe that from technical expertise to exploitation, France has a complete supply chain when it comes to critical minerals. I was recently in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, with Orano nuclear company, for example, for a record investment in uranium that we made with the Mongolian authorities. The France brand in the critical minerals supply chain is now well-established and internationally recognized. Between Orano, Eramet mining company, and other smaller players, we possess solid know-how, strengthened by the expertise we provide, particularly in situations like the one we are discussing. Kyiv Independent: Regarding cooperation with the United States, how does France plan to approach these issues in Ukraine, particularly in the face of potential market competition? Laurent Saint-Martin: France&apos;s position is to prioritize complementarity over competition. We must work together &#x2014; first on military aspects, then on reconstruction and major economic issues like decarbonization and rare mineral exploitation. France, with its companies and expertise, undeniably adds value in these sectors. This is not about competition, but collaboration for the future of Ukraine and Europe. Kyiv Independent: France is also involved in Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction, have you observed any progress in Ukraine thanks to the involvement of French companies? Laurent Saint-Martin: France has significantly strengthened its financing capacity since the war began. This has provided a real boost to many projects. We now have financial tools like concessional loans and budget loans, which are essential for supporting reconstruction. The initial French fund of 200 million euros has received requests for projects worth over 750 million euros, which shows the enormous potential of French companies ready to get involved here. Regarding reconstruction, what I&#x2019;ve observed in discussions with French companies is that there has been real progress. Since my first involvement in this area, particularly with Business France, government agency, I&#x2019;ve been able to follow the situation&#x2019;s evolution. By the end of 2022, we saw that France had truly moved to the next level, especially in terms of financing capacity, which is a key point, and the number of companies now positioning themselves on certain projects has greatly increased. We now have actors who can mobilize the right financial tools, such as the French Development Agency or Expertise France. Kyiv Independent: To what extent does that also involve Ukrainian companies? Laurent Saint-Martin: We have been working closely with Ukrainian companies in various sectors. We are not just supporting reconstruction; we are investing in new economic directions, such as decarbonization and rare mineral exploitation, which open up new opportunities for Ukraine and Europe. There really is a virtuous circle here: the more we collectively invest in Ukraine, the more Ukraine will bring into the European production chain and strengthen Europe, while adhering to its calendar of joining the European Union. Kyiv Independent: Finally, how does France and the European Union position themselves with regards to Ukraine&#x2019;s decision not to renew its gas contract with Russia? Laurent Saint-Martin: This is a question that deserves particular attention, Ukraine doesn&apos;t need gas for its own consumption. The real issue is more about transit. There are ongoing discussions in Brussels about how to address this. One thing is clear: Ukraine does not want a contractual relationship with Russia, and this is understandable. There may be other solutions or suppliers, and alternative gas routes could be explored. But these discussions are currently moving forward, and they&apos;ve progressed enough. For instance, you may have seen that the Hungarians were very concerned about this, though they were somewhat less worried last week, especially after European sanctions against Russia were extended, which was obviously very important. So, we are making progress in the right direction, and indeed, the resilience of Ukraine&apos;s energy sector in this context is quite impressive.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-trade-chief-says-paris-involved-in-rare-earths-research-in-ukraine-adds-us-not-a-competitor/	2025-02-06T09:09:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192525672.jpg
Kyiv open to talks with South Korea on captured North Korean soldiers, ambassador says	Kyiv is open to negotiating with South Korea over the possible transfer of captured North Korean soldiers, Ukrainian Ambassador to Seoul Dmytro Ponomarenko said in an interview with The Korea Times published on Feb. 5. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in January, marking what President Volodymyr Zelensky called &#x201C;irrefutable evidence&#x201D; of Pyongyang&#x2019;s involvement in Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. It remains unclear whether Ukraine has captured additional North Korean soldiers. Zelensky said on Feb. 6 that the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) were injured in combat and are currently receiving medical treatment. While Ukraine and South Korea have yet to begin formal talks, Kyiv is ready to discuss the possible transfer of the soldiers to third countries, Ponomarenko said. &quot;Given the threat to the life and freedom of North Korean servicemen in the event of their repatriation to the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and if they refuse to go back, we are open for a dialogue with international partners,&quot; the ambassador said. If the captured soldiers choose to return home, Ukraine will be required to repatriate them under the Geneva Conventions. Ponomarenko called the possibility of negotiations between Kyiv and Pyongyang over the captured North Korean soldiers &#x201C;a very delicate issue&#x201D; and declined to comment further. As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s spy chief Kyrylo Budanov said. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-discuss-north-korean-pows-transfer-with-seoul-ambassador-says/	2025-02-06T08:59:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192716379.jpg
US won't present plan to end Russia's war at Munich Security Conference, Kellogg says	Washington will not present a plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said on Feb. 6. Speaking to Newsmax TV, Kellogg denied media reports that he would introduce such a plan at the conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Kellogg said the plan would be presented by U.S. President Donald Trump but did not specify a timeline. &quot;We are going to lead it up to him to help him out, get it to a point where he delivers that, but that is not going to happen next week at all,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;We are going to have great discussions with senior leaders in the European environment and bring back what we found out to the President of the United States and then go from there.&quot; Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s strategy on the Russia-Ukraine war, has described a &quot;near-term&quot; resolution as being within 100 days of the inauguration, calling it his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution within that timeframe. Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war, which would involve &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering incentives to both sides. Trump&apos;s special envoy is also expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-present-ukraine-russia-plan-at-munich-conference-trumps-special-envoy-says/	2025-02-06T08:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1228655949.jpg
2 Russian oligarchs sell Alfa-Bank stakes hoping to escape EU sanctions, FT reports	Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven have sold their stakes in Russia&apos;s largest private bank, Alfa-Bank, and its insurance division in an effort to overturn European Union sanctions, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 6. Aven and Fridman were sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28, 2022, for their ties to the Kremlin and support for Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. In April 2024, the EU&#x2019;s General Court lifted sanctions against the two oligarchs, ruling that the EU had failed to demonstrate their role in undermining Ukraine. However, subsequent EU decisions kept them on the sanctions list under a different justification, classifying them as &quot;leading businesspersons providing substantial revenue&quot; to Russia. Investigative reporters revealed in May 2023 that Alfa Insurance, a subsidiary of Alfa-Bank owned by Fridman and Aven, provided insurance for vehicles used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The company has also reportedly serviced the Main Office of Special Programs, which is responsible for guarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to documents obtained by FT, Fridman and Aven sold their stakes in Alfa-Bank and its insurance division, Alfa Strakhovanie, for approximately 240 billion rubles ($2.5 billion) to longtime business partner Andrei Kosogov, who is not under EU sanctions. The oligarchs, who together owned 45% of Alfa-Bank and 42% of the insurance division, hope that cutting ties to the bank will strengthen their legal challenge against the EU&#x2019;s sanctions, the report said. Kosogov arranged to buy Fridman and Aven&apos;s Alfa-Bank shares using a loan from state-owned Gazprombank through a Cyprus-based holding company, according to correspondence seen by FT. However, due to transaction issues in Cyprus, Russia passed a law allowing the state to change the registration of &quot;economically significant&quot; companies operating under Western jurisdictions. Following this decision, Fridman and Aven no longer needed EU authorization to transfer control of their Russian assets, FT reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-russian-oligarchs-sell-alfa-bank-stakes-hoping-to-escape-eu-sanctions-ft-reports/	2025-02-06T07:36:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-654191414.jpg
UK to host Ramstein-format meeting next week, replacing US	London will host the next Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) summit in Brussels on Feb. 12, rather than the U.S., the U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO confirmed on Feb. 6. This will be the first Ramstein summit held under the U.K. since Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration took office. The meeting will be chaired by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &#x201C;The UDCG will gather ahead of the NATO Defense Ministerial Meeting to discuss priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against Putin&#x2019;s illegal invasion,&#x201D; the statement read. The future of the Ramstein&apos;s meetings remains uncertain, as Trump has signaled his intent to shift U.S. policy on Ukraine. Some of Ramstein&#x2019;s functions&#x2014;aside from organizing the meetings&#x2014;have already been transferred to NATO. The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) mission has been launched in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate weapons deliveries pledged by participating countries. The UDCG, which includes more than 50 countries&#x2014;including all 32 NATO members&#x2014;typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Its last gathering on Jan. 9 marked the 25th meeting since the group was established in April 2022. At the previous Ramstein meeting, discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses, including the delivery of new air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/london-to-chair-ramstein-meeting-next-week-instead-of-us/	2025-02-06T06:54:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
Russia's space chief Borisov dismissed amid program failures	Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Yury Borisov as CEO of the state space corporation Roscosmos, the Kremlin&apos;s official website announced on Feb. 6. Borisov&apos;s removal allegedly stems from uncertainty over the costs and implementation of the National Space Center project in Moscow, according to Russian media outlet RBC. Borisov was appointed as Roscosmos chief in July 2022, succeeding Dmitry Rogozin. His tenure saw a decline in launches, with 19 in 2023 &#x2014; three fewer than in 2022. Launches fell by 25% from pre-war 2021 and nearly halved compared to the early 2000s. Before leading Roscosmos, Borisov played a key role in Russia&apos;s military-industrial sector, overseeing the state rearmament program since 2011. As deputy chairman of the Military Industrial Commission, then-deputy defense minister, and later deputy prime minister, he was responsible for funneling 2 trillion rubles ($20.5 billion) annually into the defense industry. Under his leadership, Russia had pledged to produce divisions of new Armata tanks, a next-generation strategic bomber, 600 aircraft, and thousands of helicopters by 2020, while increasing the share of modern weapons in the military to 70%. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 exposed shortcomings in Russia&apos;s defense industry, with its forces relying heavily on aging Soviet-era equipment. Borisov also admitted that Roscosmos had failed to meet its 2023 state launch plan, adding to concerns over Russia&apos;s declining space capabilities amid economic strain and Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-space-chief-borisov-dismissed-amid-corruption-program-failures/	2025-02-06T05:31:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184158229.jpg
Ukraine launches new offensive in Kursk Oblast, Russian media claims, Kyiv yet to confirm	Ukraine&apos;s armed forces have reportedly launched a new offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian media claimed on Feb. 6. According to Russian military bloggers, Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked southeast of Sudzha, advancing toward the settlements of Fanaseevka and Ulanok. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukraine deployed up to two mechanized battalions for the offensive. As a result of alleged fighting, a gas pipeline was damaged in the Rylskyi district, Kursk Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the reported offensive. The possible operation follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks on Feb. 5 that Ukraine&apos;s presence in Kursk Oblast could play an &quot;important part&quot; in future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, with taken areas marked in blue and the city of Sudzha indicated with a white marker. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Since August 2024, Ukrainian forces have maintained positions in Kursk Oblast following a cross-border incursion that initially captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Kyiv has lost roughly half of that area since then, combat operations continue. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian losses have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Ukraine aims to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks while continuing to target Russian military positions in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launches-new-offensive-in-kursk-oblast-russia-claims-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-02-06T04:59:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2194086327.jpg
Ukraine regaining nuclear weapons 'not going to happen,' Trump's envoy Kellogg says	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, dismissed the possibility of Ukraine regaining nuclear power status in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 6. &quot;The chance of them getting their nuclear weapons back is somewhere between slim and none,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest about it, we both know that&apos;s not going to happen.&quot; His remarks follow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent comments suggesting that if Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession remains blocked, the U.S. should provide an alternative security guarantee, including nuclear weapons. &quot;The president said we&apos;re a government of common sense,&quot; Kellogg added. &quot;When someone suggests that, consider the outcome or potential &#x2014; use your common sense.&quot; Zelensky acknowledged that gaining NATO membership could take &quot;years or decades&quot; and raised concerns about how Ukraine would defend itself in the meantime. Ukraine formally applied to join NATO at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an invitation, with countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia resisting its entry. As Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war , Russia has made a complete ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession one of its core demands. Ukraine relinquished its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, joining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia. Moscow later violated the agreement by occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014 and launching a full-scale invasion in 2022. While the war has renewed discussions on whether Ukraine should rebuild its nuclear deterrent, Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains its best security guarantee and has no plans to develop nuclear weapons. Kellogg will attend the Munich Security Conference from Feb. 14 to 16, where he will meet with world leaders to discuss Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and assess positions on negotiations. &quot;As you develop the plans to end this carnage, you have to make sure that you&apos;ve got the feel of everybody in play,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;Once we get to have these face-to-face discussions, then you can really kind of work &#x2026; on concessions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/not-going-to-happen-trumps-peace-envoy-rules-out-kyiv-regaining-nuclear-status/	2025-02-06T04:51:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Russia to recruit 210,000 personnel for drone forces by 2030, Syrskyi says	Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the full-scale invasion, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. &quot;We are aware of the enemy&apos;s plans, which envisage 210,000 unmanned systems troops in 277 military units by 2030,&quot; Syrskyi said. The statement follows Syrskyi&apos;s monthly meeting on drone warfare, where he reviewed Ukraine&apos;s use of unmanned systems in January 2025. Syrskyi claimed improving coordination between drone units and conventional military forces from reports from brigades and battalions. According to Syrsyi, 66% of Russian equipment destroyed in January resulted from various types of attack drones. The number of targets hit by drones increased by 7% compared to December, with Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones responsible for 49% of all damage inflicted. Ukraine has continuously expanded its drone capabilities, using aerial, naval, and ground-based systems for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and other operations. The country&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces announced on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian troops are now employing a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) while carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. On Feb. 6, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree officially establishing Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces as a separate branch within the Armed Forces, underscoring the growing role of drones in modern military strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-recruit-210-000-personnel-for-unmanned-systems-forces-by-2030-syrskyi-reports/	2025-02-06T03:18:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Ze.jpeg
First French Mirage fighter jets reportedly arrive in Ukraine — here's what they can do	The first French Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets pledged to Kyiv have arrived in Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Feb. 6. &quot;On June 6, 2024, (French President) Emmanuel Macron announced the delivery of French Mirage 2000 to Ukraine. The first of these arrived in Ukraine today,&quot; Lecornu said in a post on social media. &quot;With Ukrainian pilots trained for several months in France on board, they will now participate in defending Ukraine&apos;s sky,&quot; he added. Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. According to earlier repots, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multirole supersonic jet, was introduced by the French manufacturer Dassault in the 1970s. With over 600 aircraft produced across all variants, it serves nine countries, available in single- and twin-seat variants. The Mirage 2000-5, introduced in 1999, represents an upgraded version featuring advanced avionics, enhanced firing capabilities for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, and a modern sensor and control system. &#x201C;The (Mirage 2000)-5 variant has a high-quality radar, (is) fitted with drop tanks, has a reasonable range, and carries a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons,&#x201D; Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent last year. A significant enhancement of the Mirage 2000-5 is the inclusion of the Thomson-CSF Radar Doppler Multi-target (RDY), augmenting its capabilities for deep-strike and close-support missions. Equipped with a variety of air-to-air missiles and weapons, such as Mica missiles with a range of up to 60 kilometers or older Magic short-range missiles, the Mirage 2000-5 can be configured to meet diverse mission requirements. Its capacity for carrying drop tanks further extends its operational range. In terms of air-to-ground operations, the Mirage 2000 can deploy various weaponry, including SCALP missiles, previously supplied to Ukraine by France, and guided bombs. While the French Air Force has around 40 Mirage 2000-5s, only 26 one-seaters are in active service. The French military is reportedly planning to phase them out by the end of the decade, replacing them with the more advanced Dassault Rafale and thereby potentially freeing up the older Mirage 2000 aircraft for transfer to Ukraine. A Taiwanese Air Force Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet taxis on the runway, during the Sky Dragon aerial drill, at an airbase in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on 7 November, 2024 (Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Images)How can Ukraine use them?Mirage jets are versatile and can be used for ground strikes, intercepting missiles, and countering drones. Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent last year that Ukraine could use the aircraft to target Russian positions with Storm Shadow or SCALP missiles. According to Layton, the Ukrainian Air Force has a dwindling supply of Su-24 aircraft previously used for SCALP launches. Mirage 2000-5s can deploy anti-ship Exocet missiles and AS 37 anti-radar projectiles, Kevliuk added. The jets can also conduct strikes using long-range bombs, such as the AASM Hammer, and incorporate advanced precision-guided munitions like JDAM-ER and SDB, which offer increasing targeting accuracy and flexibility. However, Layton advised caution regarding Mirage ground attack missions near the front lines due to vulnerability to Russian air defenses. &#x201C;The Mirage 2000-5 has only a limited range when carrying bombs,&#x201D; even if fitted with drop tanks, Layton said. &#x201C;I think the small fleet of Mirage 2000-5s that will be provided would be too important to lose. This means air defense and firing long-range stand-off missiles is the best use for them.&#x201D; Air defense capabilities are crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense against ongoing Russian missile and drone attacks on civilian areas and critical infrastructure. Considering Macron&#x2019;s earlier statement permitting strikes on Russian military targets if they pose a threat to Ukraine, Mirage kets theoretically wouldn&#x2019;t be confined to Ukrainian airspace for their operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-french-mirage-fighter-jets-reportedly-arrive-in-ukraine-heres-what-they-can-do/	2025-02-06T02:47:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2182690921.jpg
North Korean missiles show improved accuracy in Russian attacks on Ukraine, Reuters reports	North Korean missiles used by Russia in attacks on Ukraine since December have become more accurate, Reuters reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Analysts believe North Korea is using the battlefield as a testing ground for its missile technology, enhancing its weapons for future use. North Korea has supplied Russia with artillery ammunition, ballistic missiles, and soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion. Military cooperation deepened after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defense pact with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. A military source told Reuters that more than 20 North Korean ballistic missiles fired at Ukraine have displayed improved accuracy in recent weeks, with their deviation from the intended target reduced to 50-100 meters. A Ukrainian official familiar with North Korean missile strikes also allegedly confirmed the information, according to Reuters. Reports indicate that North Korea has provided Russia with over 5 million artillery shells and at least 100 short-range ballistic missiles, including KN-23/24 types. Pyongyang has significantly advanced its missile programs in recent years, developing short- and medium-range systems that allegedly can carry nuclear warheads. Elsewhere, North Korean troops who had been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since last fall to support Moscow&apos;s war effort have reportedly withdrawn from frontline positions. Yonhap news agency, citing South Korean intelligence, reported on Feb. 4 that North Korean soldiers had not been engaged in combat since mid-January. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. Ukraine&apos;s forces have been operating in Kursk Oblast since launching a cross-border incursion in August 2024, seizing approximately 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-use-of-north-korean-missiles-in-ukraine-sees-greater-precision-reuters-reports/	2025-02-06T02:18:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
Russian media lies' — Ben Stiller denies claims about USAID funding his Ukraine trip, reposted by Musk	U.S. actor Ben Stiller has denied social media reports on Feb. 5 that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded his humanitarian trip to Ukraine, calling the claims &quot;lies coming from Russian media.&quot; &quot;I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind,&quot; Stiller posted on X, adding the claims were &quot;100 percent false.&quot; Stiller&apos;s comments came after billionaire Elon Musk reposted a fabricated story on X suggesting that USAID financed Western celebrities&apos; visits to Ukraine. In his role as a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) goodwill ambassador, Stiller met with Ukrainian families afflicted by Russia&#x2019;s war in a trip to the country in June 2022. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation also dismissed the claim, noting the alleged article in the post boosted by Musk did not exist on the news website it was purportedly from. &quot;Accordingly, the information it broadcasts is an invention of Russian fake newsmakers,&quot; the center said. Musk, head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) and owner of X, has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to shut it down. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation warned that despite X being blocked in Russia, Kremlin propaganda continues to use the platform to spread false narratives. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. These are lies coming from Russian media. I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind. &#x1F4AF; percent false. https://t.co/EFBPmrFQJ6 The funding has supported rebuilding schools, financing bomb shelters, and equipping hospitals with advanced medical equipment. The agency&apos;s future remains uncertain as the Trump administration has frozen all international funding for 90 days. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that foreign aid should advance U.S. interests rather than serve as charity, stressing that the administration does not plan to end all international assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/self-funded-actor-stiller-denies-claims-of-usaid-funding-his-ukraine-trip-reposted-by-musk/	2025-02-06T02:05:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/13220d209a32c2e16c526150d0b5ef4f_1655744746.jpeg
Nearly 40,000 Russian troops lost in Kursk Oblast in six months, 16,000 killed, Ukraine says	Over six months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, with over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Ukrainian forces have also reportedly captured 909 Russian soldiers during the operation, bolstering Kyiv&apos;s exchange fund and enabling the return of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders held in Russian prisons. &quot;The Kursk offensive remains an example of sudden, asymmetric, and successful actions by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, allowing them to inflict heavy losses on a superior enemy and seize the initiative on the battlefield,&quot; the General Staff added. Ukraine has held positions in Kursk Oblast since launching a cross-border incursion in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Kyiv has since lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Ukraine aims to use its presence in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential negotiations. &quot;The operation forced the Russian occupiers to transfer significant resources to the Kursk Oblast, weakening their positions on other frontlines,&quot; the statement reads. The operation in Kursk Oblast may become an &quot;important part&quot; of future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 5. The General Staff also highlighted that &#xA0;Moscow was forced to seek military assistance from North Korea, which deployed around 12,000 troops to Kursk Oblast. Of those, an estimated 4,000 have been killed. One of the three North Korean brigades was &quot;effectively destroyed,&quot; while the other two lost combat capability, forcing Pyongyang&apos;s forces to withdraw from the front lines, the General Staff said. North Korean troops have not been engaged in combat in Kursk Oblast since mid-January, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 4. On the same day, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;We have to wait for some time to see if there are any real changes or if this is just lower activity for a couple of days,&quot; Budanov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-40-000-russian-troops-lost-in-kursk-oblast-over-six-months-military-says/	2025-02-06T00:51:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
1 killed, 24 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least one civilian and injured 24 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 6. Russia launched 77 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 56 drones over nine oblasts, while 18 others were lost without causing damage. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and wounded 18 others, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Donetsk Oblast, four civilians were wounded &#x2014; two in Pokrovsk, one in Lyman, and one in Roza &#x2014; according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kharkiv Oblast, two men were injured in Kupiansk &#x2014; a 57-year-old volunteer and a 43-year-old resident, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, shelling damaged at least 15 residential buildings, though no civilian casualties were reported. Ukraine has faced daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities continuing to report casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-24-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-05T23:45:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-05_20-00-06.jpg
Ukraine strikes Shahed-type drone launch site in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, military claims	Ukraine struck the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai with drones overnight on Feb. 6, the General Staff reported. &quot;Confirmed hit and explosions in the target area. A fire has broken out. The results of the hit are being clarified,&quot; the statement reads. The airfield, located 230 kilometers (142 miles) from the front line, is a key launch site for Russian Shahed-type drones used against Ukraine, the General Staff said, adding it also serves as a storage, training, and maintenance facility for aircraft operating in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts. Russian local Telegram channels reported explosions near the airfield following the strike. &quot;Strikes on the facilities involved in ensuring Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine and terrorizing the civilian population will continue,&quot; the General Staff added. Since the fall of 2022, Russia has launched thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed drones from Primorsko-Akhtarsk, targeting Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-airfield-in-krasnodar-targeting-shahed-drone-launch-site/	2025-02-05T23:00:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-06_07-21-55-2.jpg

Protest planned against 'Russians at War' documentary screenings in Australia	Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Australia are set to protest the screening of the controversial &quot;Russians at War&quot; documentary at the Antenna Documentary Film Festival in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 6. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova&apos;s documentary Russians at War has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. The documentary has been criticized for lacking a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, failing to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime. Earlier in her career, Trofimova worked for Russia Today (RT), a Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organizations&apos; (AFUO) planned rally comes as controversy continues to follow the film, after initially appearing on the official list of screenings at the prestigious Venice and Toronto film festivals. Following protest across different cities since the film first raised controversy in September 2024, organizers at various international film festivals have pulled the film from various festivals&apos; schedule. Despite the anticipated protest, the Antenna Film Festival, which is scheduled to begin screening the film on Feb. 10, has not removed its scheduled screening from the festival&apos;s lineup. &quot;The Ukrainian community has come together with strength and focus to stop this russian propaganda being screened in Australia,&quot; the AFUO said in a statement. &quot;This film is not an independent expos&#xE9; &#x2014; it is a carefully controlled narrative that serves the interests of the Russian state.&quot; In the most prominent case, the Toronto International Film Festival decided to pull the film from the schedule, citing security concerns, but later decided to hold a special screening for the film after the end of the festival in September, drawing widespread criticism. Controversy further spread as it was revealed the Russians at War film received 340,000 Canadian dollars from the Canada Media Fund. On Oct. 7, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) began investigating Trofimova on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/protests-planned-against-russians-at-war-documentary-film-screening-in-australia/	2025-02-05T21:15:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/PXL_20240910_184239418.jpg
Azerbaijan to deliver $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine	Azerbaijan will deliver $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the form of electrical equipment to support the country&apos;s energy grid, President Ilham Aliyev&apos;s office announced on Feb. 5. &quot;Relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and Ukraine are developing on the basis of friendship and partnership,&quot; a statement from Aliyev&apos;s office read. Azerbaijan previously provided Ukraine with a batch of equipment for the restoration of the country&apos;s energy grid following the winter of 2023. Baku has also delivered at least 10 shipments of humanitarian aid for the energy sector since the start of the full-scale invasion, including at least 50 reserve power stations and 45 power transformers. The funding will come from the president&apos;s allocated reserve budget and will allow the country&apos;s Energy Ministry to disperse the aid directly to Kyiv. &quot;In connection with the current situation in Ukraine, the Azerbaijani state has repeatedly sent humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people,&quot; Aliyev&apos;s office said in a statement. In recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has attempted to form closer ties with Aliyev, offering Ukraine to serve as transit hub for Azerbaijani gas to Europe, following the suspension of Russian gas flows to the continent. Azerbaijan, who has maintained historical ties with Russia, has seen relations with Moscow dwindle in recent months following the Dec. 25 crash of Flight J2-8243, which killed 38 people. Aliyev has accused Russia of causing the crash, accusing the Kremlin of a &quot;disaster&quot; caused by the &quot;representatives of the Russian Federation.&quot; On Feb. 4, an unnamed Azerbaijani official told Reuters that the plane was struck by a Russian Pantsir air defense missile after diverting from Russian airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-to-deliver-1-million-in-humanitarian-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-05T19:36:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/aliyev.jpg
Georgian parliament votes to terminate mandates of 49 opposition MPs	Members of Georgia&apos;s ruling Georgian Dream party voted to revoke the mandates of 49 opposition parliamentarians on Feb. 5 after they refused to take their seats, citing concerns over the legitimacy of the results of the October parliamentary election. The vote effectively brings the total number of Georgian parliamentarians down to 89 of the 150 elected in the disputed parliamentary elections &#x2014; all of which now sit under the Georgian Dream party banner. &#xA0; Although 49 elected MPs formally requested to resign their mandates in protests, a further 12 opposition MPs from the &quot;For Georgia&quot; party have refused to attend parliamentary sessions. The October election, which was widely disputed by the opposition and international observers, re-elected the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has drawn criticism for steering Georgia closer to Russia while hindering its EU accession. Following the election, mass protests erupted in Tbilisi over the results, as well as amid a political crisis sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s announcement that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. Anti-Western politician Mikheil Kavelashvili, an ally of the ruling Georgian Dream party, was inaugurated as the country&apos;s sixth president on Dec. 29 in a move seen as illegitimate by the opposition. Georgia&apos;s fifth president, Salome Zourabichvili, said she would vacate the presidential palace but stressed she remains the only legitimate head of state, pledging to continue the struggle against the ruling party. Since the election, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions on Georgia over the perceived democratic backsliding. On Jan. 27, the European Union suspended parts of its visa facilitation agreement with Georgia.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-dream-votes-to-terminate-mandates-of-49-opposition-mps/	2025-02-05T18:17:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150233392.jpg
Baltic states to cut energy ties with Russia, join European power grid, AFP reports	Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia will disconnect from Russia&#x2019;s power grid this weekend and synchronize with the Western European network. Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia on Feb. 8, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius the next day. Lithuanian Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said the move ends Russia&#x2019;s ability to use energy as political leverage, according to AFP. The Baltic states have been preparing for this transition for years. Despite stopping Russian gas and electricity imports after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, their power grids remained linked to Russia and Belarus, with Moscow controlling electricity flows. At 7 a.m. local time on Feb. 8, the three countries will operate in &quot;isolated mode&quot; for 24 hours to test their ability to manage power levels. They will then integrate with Europe&#x2019;s grid through Poland. Lithuania&#x2019;s state-run grid operator, Litgrid, said the process includes switching power stations on and off to assess frequency stability. Lithuania has warned of potential risks, including cyberattacks and sabotage. Poland&#x2019;s power grid operator, PSE, will monitor the connection with helicopters and drones. Several undersea cables in the Baltic Sea have been damaged in recent months, raising security concerns. Russia has denied involvement. Officials say no major power disruptions are expected, but Estonian retailers report a rise in generator sales. The Baltic states are also increasing domestic energy production, including offshore wind farms.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-states-to-cut-energy-ties-with-russia-join-european-power-grid-afp-reports/	2025-02-05T16:16:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1527606933.jpg
Majority of Germans support military aid to Ukraine, survey shows	A majority of German citizens support providing military assistance to Ukraine, with a significant portion advocating for increased aid, according to a new poll by the Wahlen research group for ZDF Frontal, a German investigative political program. The representative survey found that 67% of Germans back Germany&#x2019;s military support for Ukraine. Within this group, 27% favor increasing military aid to Kyiv, while 40% believe Germany should maintain its current level of support. Meanwhile, 27% of respondents called for a reduction in weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Security expert Jana Puglierin from the European Council on Foreign Relations highlighted the significance of these findings. &quot;It is remarkable that, when combining those who want to continue supporting Ukraine, we reach 67%, which is a clear majority,&quot; she told ZDF Frontal. &quot;This means that the so-called &#x2018;Ukraine fatigue&#x2019; mentioned by some politicians is not reflected in the public.&quot; Support for military assistance is higher in western Germany than in the east. In the west, 70% of respondents support supplying weapons, with 28% calling for increased aid and 42% favoring the current level. In eastern Germany, 53% support military assistance, with 20% backing increased aid and 33% preferring the status quo. Among political party supporters, voters of the Green Party show the strongest approval for increasing arms deliveries to Ukraine, with 45% in favor. In contrast, 79% of Alternative for Germany (AfD) supporters and 52% of those backing the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance advocate for reducing military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/majority-of-germans-support-military-aid-to-ukraine-survey-shows/	2025-02-05T15:42:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-158520585-1.jpg
Ukraine imposes sanctions on Russian 'shadow fleet' captains, cultural heritage looters	President Volodymyr Zelensky has approved sanctions against 57 captains of Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers routinely used to evade sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s oil trade, and 55 individuals involved in looting Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural heritage in occupied Crimea. The measures, adopted by Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council on Feb. 5, target 56 Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other violations to bypass price caps. The individuals include captains of sanctioned tankers operated by Sovcomflot, a company already blacklisted by the U.S. and the U.K. By restricting experienced captains from participating in these operations, Ukraine aims to disrupt Russia&#x2019;s oil trade and raise operational costs for its shadow fleet. Additionally, sanctions have been imposed on Russian officials and cultural figures responsible for illegal excavations and the removal of Ukrainian artifacts from Crimea. Among those targeted are high-ranking officials from Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Culture, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and directors of major state-run museums, including the Hermitage and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts. They face asset freezes and international travel restrictions. Ukraine has also sanctioned three museums operating under Russian law on occupied territory, including the Tauric Chersonesos Historical and Archaeological Museum-Reserve, which houses UNESCO-listed heritage. Kyiv aims to draw international attention to Russia&#x2019;s unlawful cultural plunder and encourage partner nations to impose similar sanctions. These measures mark the first instance of individual accountability for shadow fleet captains aiding Russia&#x2019;s oil trade. Ukrainian authorities believe these sanctions will deter future participation in the tanker fleet and complicate Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to recruit new personnel while also curbing the looting of Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural treasures.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-shadow-fleet-captains-and-cultural-heritage-looters/	2025-02-05T13:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Euroclear to send 2-billion-euro tranche of Russian assets profits for Kyiv	The European Union will receive a second tranche of 2 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from profits generated by frozen Russian Central Bank assets that are meant for Ukraine and its war effort. Euroclear, the Belgian-based clearing house, sent its first payment of 1.55 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last July after the EU passed legislation that applied a windfall tax to the profits generated by Russia&apos;s assets immobilized in response to the full-scale invasion. The clearing house said in a statement on Feb. 5 that the second payment is expected to be made in March and should amount to approximately 2 billion euros. Euroclear earned 6.9 billion euros ($7.18 billion) in 2024 from frozen Russian assets, the statement says. In 2023, these revenues amounted to 4.4 billion euros ($4.6 million). From the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in 2024, 1.7 billion euros ($1.77 billion) was transferred to the Belgian budget as tax revenues. In reaction to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, more than $300 billion of the foreign exchange reserve assets of the central bank of the Russian Federation were frozen in Europe. Most of these funds &#x2014;191 billion euros ($198 million) &#x2014; are kept in the international depository Euroclear in Belgium. The Group of Seven countries agreed last year on a $50 billion loan that will be paid back using the profits generated from frozen assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-than-2-billion-of-russian-assets-profits-in-europe-are-to-be-transferred-to-the-fund-for-ukraine/	2025-02-05T13:00:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1904616761.jpg
DVL Group, owner of Ukraine’s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell, plans to cut 15% of IT staff following merger	Ukraine&apos;s newly formed telecommunications company DVL Group is planning to cut 15% of its IT department due to business consolidation and optimization, the company told Economichna Pravda on Feb. 4. &#xA0; French billionaire Xavier Niel bought and merged fixed operator Data Group Volia and Lifecell &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator &#x2014; last year in a deal worth more than $500 million. It was the largest foreign direct investments into Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation provided $435 million to finance the deal. DVL plans to restructure its IT department, unifying the business model of all three operators, which may lead to staff reductions, the company said. The process is set to be completed in 2025. &quot;The review, updates, and optimization affect company costs, business processes, IT systems, and organizational structures. For each area, we&apos;re choosing solutions that will allow continued operations without losing efficiency or service quality,&quot; DVL stated. As part of the transformation, the technical division will expand significantly. The company will hire more than 300 new specialists to implement energy resilience projects and build and modernize grids.	https://kyivindependent.com/dvl-group-owner-of-ukraines-third-largest-mobile-operator-lifecell-plans-to-cut-15-of-it-staff-following-merger/	2025-02-05T12:23:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1857415237.jpg
Ukraine's operation in Kursk Oblast may become 'important part' of negotiation process, Zelensky says	Ukrainian forces&apos; operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast may become an &quot;important part&quot; of the negotiation process to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 5 after a meeting with British Foreign Minister David Lammy in Kyiv, Ukrinform reported. Zelensky previously concurred that Kyiv would seek an end to the war this year but urged partners to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength. In a surprise turn, the Ukrainian president also recently acknowledged the possibility of sitting at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve peace. &quot;You will see what conditions the Russians will have for Ukraine regarding the Kursk direction when we reach a diplomatic settlement of the war&apos;s end. This was a crucial step,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I don&apos;t like to use words like &apos;historic.&apos; Ukraine&apos;s whole life, its struggle, is probably a historical path, and so I will not use this word in relation to this operation. But it was definitely very important,&quot; the president added. Zelensky mentioned that Feb. 6 will mark exactly six months since Ukraine launched its incursion in Kursk Oblast. The president added that Ukrainian forces &quot;are steadily keeping the situation (under control) there and will continue to do so&quot; when the Russian army suffers &quot;heavy losses.&quot; Zelensky also noted that several important targets had been hit by Ukraine with long-range weapons in Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think that they (Russian forces) will not be able to push us out of this territory shortly, and this is like a magnet that keeps 60,000 of their military in this area today,&quot; the president said. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. Trump&apos;s team may present a plan to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, according to Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-operation-in-kursk-oblast-may-become-important-part-of-negotiation-process-zelensky-says/	2025-02-05T12:19:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Almost 3 times more people died in Ukraine than were born in 2024, data shows	Ukraine registered 495,090 deaths of various causes in 2024, which is almost three times more than were born, according to data published by the Justice Ministry. The data was collected only on territory currently controlled by Ukraine. Due to a lack of access, figures for the partially occupied Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are likely incomplete and the data is completely missing from occupied Luhansk Oblast and Crimea. The highest mortality rate of 53,268 deaths was recorded in the front-line Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. About 35,000 deaths were recorded in the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv Oblast, located in the northeast on the border with Russia. Justice Ministry data showed that 176,679 children were born in Ukraine in 2024. Compared to data before the full-scale invasion in 2021, births decreased by 97,093, or 35.5%. The city of Kyiv recorded the highest number of births, with 19,706, followed by Lviv Oblast in the west with 15,642, and the heavily populated central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with 14,029. The least amount of children were born in Kherson Oblast with 434 births recorded last year. Kherson Oblast is partially occupied by Russia, with the Ukrainian-controlled parts subject to regular Russian attacks. The country&apos;s population went from a peak of over 50 million in the early 1990s to over 37 million by January 2024. According to one of the U.N.&apos;s projections, Ukraine&apos;s population could drop to 15.3 million by 2100.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-3-times-more-people-died-in-ukraine-than-were-born-in-2024-data-shows/	2025-02-05T11:55:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241589667.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine returns 150 people from Russian captivity in prisoner swap	Key developments on Feb. 5: Ukraine brought back 150 Ukrainian service members from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 5, marking the latest prisoner exchange between Kyiv and Moscow. The released Ukrainian captives included members of the Navy, the Air Force, the Airborne Troops, the National Guard, the State Border Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces, and a police officer, according to the president. &quot;They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common: They fought for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. Some POWs had been held captive for more than two years, according to Zelensky. Among the released soldiers are those in serious condition. They have a long rehabilitation and recovery ahead, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported. At the same time, Russia announced the return of 150 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) from Ukrainian captivity. During the last exchange, which took place on Dec. 30, 2024, 189 people returned from Russian captivity. In 2024, 1,358 Ukrainians were released, and since the beginning of the all-out war, 3,956 Ukrainians have returned from Russian captivity, Zelensky said in his New Year&apos;s address. Ukrainian forces struck a Russian oil facility in Krasnodar Krai and a Buk air defense system in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight on Feb. 5, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. An attack carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Defense Forces set fire to the Albashneft oil facility in Novominskaya in southwestern Russia, according to the statement. Earlier the same day, Krasnodar Krai authorities reported a Ukrainian drone attack that started a fire at an unspecified oil depot that allegedly contained a &quot;residual amount&quot; of petroleum product. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;The hit has been confirmed,&quot; the General Staff said, describing the facility as a &quot;mini-refinery&quot; involved in the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel for Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of damage to the facility is being determined. The General Staff also reported a successful hit against the Buk system in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, adding that &quot;damage to the target was recorded.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The U.K. will provide Ukraine with 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new humanitarian and economic assistance to promote a long-term partnership between the two nations, the British government announced on Feb. 5. &quot;This funding for social, humanitarian, and energy programs will strengthen our resilience. And this assistance is very timely right now,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at a press conference with his British counterpart, David Lammy, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Lammy is visiting Kyiv to discuss continued U.K. support for Ukraine as it enters the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The U.K. official is expected to assess firsthand how British aid is assisting Ukraine on the battlefield and in civilian infrastructure recovery. The new funding is part of a broader 100-year partnership agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16. In addition to the financial aid, the U.K. will allocate 3 million pounds ($3.7 million) to supply Ukrainian grain and other food products to Syria, working with the World Food Program. &quot;Unlike Russian grain supplies to the brutal Assad regime, which attempted to buy favor while burdening Syria with costly debt, this planned support will provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in Syria,&quot; the British government&apos;s statement read. London previously committed a record 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024, including advanced weapons systems and munitions. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26 billion pound ($2.7 billion) loan under the G7 program will also be released to fund major procurement projects for Ukraine&apos;s defense. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets, marking another step in the West&apos;s efforts to use Russia&apos;s frozen funds to finance Ukraine&apos;s war effort and recovery. &quot;We have agreed on the need to continue using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In the near future, we will begin utilizing funds from the U.K. loan of more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) sourced from these assets,&quot; Sybiha said. The Defense Ministry is launching an initiative to increase the use of unmanned ground systems in the Ukrainian army, introducing robotics units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 5. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in unmanned vehicles, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, revolutionizing warfare. Ukraine is increasing the production of unmanned ground systems and deploying full-fledged robotic units as part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; combat brigades on the front line, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote on Facebook. &quot;We continue transforming the Ukrainian Armed Forces into a modern army with a technological advantage over the enemy. Our goal is to create an army in which innovative technologies help to perform the most dangerous tasks while saving the lives of our defenders,&quot; Umerov said. The project is the result of tests conducted in cooperation with the military since the summer of 2024, he added. Unmanned ground systems have proven to perform several tasks on the battlefield, including offensive and defensive activities, evacuation of the wounded, logistical support for units, and mining and demining areas, according to the minister. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. The U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons, if it is not ready to accept the country into NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published on Feb. 4. &quot;What kind of support package, what kind of missiles? Will they give us nuclear weapons? Then let them give us nuclear weapons,&quot; the president said when talking about possible guarantees instead of quick NATO entry. Zelensky acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession could be delayed &quot;for years or decades,&quot; raising the question of how the country would defend itself. Ukraine applied to join NATO at the outset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge last year that Kyiv&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia continue to resist its entry. Zelensky argued that while the West can supply Ukraine with missiles to deter Russia, their ability to stop Russian nuclear weapons is &quot;a rhetorical question.&quot; &quot;Let&apos;s do this: give us nuclear weapons back; give us missile systems; help us finance a million-strong army; or deploy your contingents in parts of our country where we want stability so that people feel safe,&quot; Zelensky said, outlining hypothetical alternatives. The comments come after Zelensky criticized Ukraine&apos;s 1990s decision to give up its nuclear weapons without receiving robust security guarantees in return. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arsenal stationed on its territory and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In exchange, the U.S., U.K., and Russia provided security assurances. Twenty years later, Russia occupied Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years on, it is waging a full-scale war against Ukraine. The invasion has reignited discussions over whether Ukraine should develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent, though Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains the best possible security guarantee and said it has no plans for building a new nuclear arsenal. Ukraine has lost 45,100 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. Zelensky added that there have been a total of 390,000 cases of soldiers sustaining wounds on the battle, although the actual number of wounded soldiers is less given that some soldiers sustained multiple wounds during separate incidents. In previous statements on the total casualty count, Zelensky said that approximately half of the soldiers wounded in action later return to the battlefield. The comments from Zelensky comes as a rare admission from a Ukrainian official about the casualty count on the front line. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count in December 2024, claiming that Ukraine had lost 43,000 solider, with &quot;370,000 cases of medical assistance for the wounded.&quot; Despite the estimates, Zelensky added that it was not clear as to how many thousands of men are currently held as prisoners of war compared to those missing in action. &quot;How many of those are missing (in action) and how many of those are prisoners (of war), I do not know the precise number but we are working on it,&quot; Zelensky added. Comparing Ukraine&apos;s casualty count to that of Russia, Zelensky said in the interview that approximately 350,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, with between 600,000 to 700,000 instances of Russian soldiers sustaining wounds on the battlefield.

US weapons aid to Ukraine is about to run out	Funds that Congress approved for weapons packages to Ukraine during the Biden administration are nearly empty, with most weapons already in Ukraine. A Dec. 30 package from former U.S. President Joe Biden used up the last of the funding from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which since 2022 has allocated $32.7 billion to buy Ukraine new equipment. That final package included mostly air defense missiles and ammunition for rocket systems like HIMARS, as well as simpler artillery shells, which are a consistent pain point given Ukraine&#x2019;s constant need. Even prior to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, the Pentagon&#x2019;s 2025 request for funding to restock the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative was a relatively meager $300 million. Of roughly $45.8 billion that has been sent to a separate &#x201C;drawdown&#x201D; fund, approved in the last Congress, only $3.8 billion &#x2014; about 8% &#x2014; remains. The structure of these &#x201C;drawdowns&#x201D; pays U.S. arms makers to replenish stockpiles of old weapons sent to Ukraine, with the money going to new equipment that stays in America. Anything the Pentagon actually sends to Ukraine will be worth significantly less than $3.8 billion. The new Congress has yet to approve a new budget for 2025 and any future weapons appropriations to Ukraine are largely in Trump&#x2019;s hands. Ukraine&#x2019;s continued dependence on that dwindling U.S. weaponry gives Trump enormous leverage. Trump appears to want to use this leverage to strike a deal on Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral reserves. Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky has signaled he is open to a deal. U.S. weapons have been critical to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Zelensky recently tallied U.S. weapons packages as about 40% of Ukraine&#x2019;s total arms supply &#x2014; still a hefty chunk despite extensive work to expand Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic defense production. The slow pace of physical weapons deliveries to Ukraine has also caused controversy, particularly since the end of 2023. Even after the political approval of packages, the physical relocation process was bogged down and tracking remains uncertain. As funding nears its end, the Pentagon has, it says, already delivered most of what has been allocated. &#x201C;As of Jan. 10, the Department of Defense has delivered 89% of critical munitions, 94% of anti-armor systems, and 75% of other fire capabilities committed to Ukraine through Presidential Drawdown Authority,&#x201D; said Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz, a Pentagon representative. Remaining arms are set to trickle in. But what&#x2019;s left in transit is mostly old armored personnel carriers and military trucks. &#x201C;The main refurbishments are vehicles, which will continue to be delivered into the summer,&#x201D; Dietz said. &#x201C;Delivery timelines for critical combat equipment, like artillery systems and Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, as well as other armored vehicles, such as M113s and HMMWVs, can sometimes be longer because we must first repair the vehicles.&#x201D; American-made vehicles are not at the top of the list of Ukrainian needs at the moment, said Kateryna Bondar, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. &#x201C;No, Ukraine cannot produce (Bradleys) by itself, but Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t need this kind of weaponry on the front line right now,&#x201D; she said. Ukraine&#x2019;s actual needs are more rote, according to Bondar. &#x201C;Simply put: 155 mm explosives. Maybe it&#x2019;s not very fancy. But artillery, long-range strikes, air defense &#x2014; &#xA0;expensive conventional systems, this is what Ukraine needs the most.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-weapons-aid-to-ukraine-is-about-to-run-out/	2025-02-05T11:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
Ferrexpo's Ukraine subsidiary hit with $3.8 billion civil claim	The Ukrainian subsidiary Poltava Mining (FPM) of London-listed Ferrexpo said a civil claim for Hr 157 billion ($3.78 billion) was filed against it over illegal mining in Ukraine and the sale of waste products. The company&apos;s shares dropped 21% to 81.9 cents, hitting their lowest point since November. &quot;Initial accusations on the illegal sale of waste products have transformed into accusations that FPM is illegally mining and selling subsoil, which is said to have caused damage to the environment,&quot; Ferrexpo said in a statement on Feb. 4. The company denied the allegations, declaring its intentions to defend its position in the Ukrainian courts. The lawsuit does not affect the company&apos;s operations, the statement said. &quot;FPM mines and extracts iron ore according to its mining license. The iron ore is then processed to produce iron ore pellets. As a result of these processes, any waste that is leftover is stockpiled in accordance with best mining practices and in compliance with environmental standards,&#x201D; the company said. In August 2024, the CEO and three other top managers of Poltava Mining were suspected of conducting illegal mining of minerals of national importance over a six-year period. Ukrainian police accused the company of legalizing more than 885 tons of crushed stone products worth more than Hr 33.5 million ($806,656), despite the fact that it was licensed only to extract iron ore. Ferrexpo owns 100% of Poltava Mining (FPM). A 50% stake in Ferrexpo is owned by Fevamotinico S.a.r.l., which is controlled by businessman Kostyantyn Zhevago, charged with embezzlement, and 6.74% by BlackRock, an American international investment company.	https://kyivindependent.com/ferrexpos-ukraine-subsidiary-hit-with-3-8-billion-civil-claim/	2025-02-05T11:17:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-680305236.jpg
Ukraine’s steel sector looks abroad after loss of critical Donbas coal mine	Ukraine&#x2019;s steel producers are now looking abroad to stay alive after the closure of the country&apos;s last operating coking coal mine in Pokrovsk last month. Miners were working up until Jan. 13 when the Metinvest Group, the mine&#x2019;s owner, halted production completely and evacuated employees as Russian troops advanced on Pokrvosk in Donetsk Oblast. The Pokrvosk mine was the last remaining coking coal site in Ukrainian-controlled territory and was worth around $1.8 billion before the war, according to the GMK Center, a metallurgy consulting company. In order to extract coke, which is used as fuel in blast furnaces, the coking coal is heated in a vacuum. Without it, it is impossible to make steel. Ukraine&#x2019;s steel producers will now have to increase imports of the fuel, racking up transport costs. This will hinder the global competitiveness of Ukrainian steel, which has already taken a pounding since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Annual coke and coking coal production capacity in Ukraine, million tons. (The Kyiv Independent)Companies still plan to keep producing steel, which will be a much-needed product when reconstruction projects take off post-war. But some analysts are unsure if Ukrainian producers can afford to cover the needed imports. &#x201C;To produce the 2024 volume of steel &#x2014; 7.5 million metric tons &#x2014; we would need (to import) 1.9 million tons of coal. We have doubts whether it would be possible to import such quantities and definitely it would further increase the costs of our steel producers,&#x201D; Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association, told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine is only one of four countries in the world that has all the raw resources to produce steel, including coking coal, a critical industry in the country. Once in the top ten globally, its position has slumped to below 20th since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine&#x2019;s ample coke production reached 23.7 million tons in 2013. After Russia invaded the country&#x2019;s east in 2014 &#x2014; where most of Ukraine&#x2019;s coking coal lies &#x2014; coke production dropped to 11.7 million tons in 2015 and just 2.7 million tons last year, according to the GMK Center. In the year before the full-scale war, the Pokrovsk mine produced on average 3.5 million metric tons of coke annually. This dropped to 2.6 million tons during the war, with miners working under heavy fire as Russian troops pummeled Pokrovsk until it was forced to close. Coking coal &amp; coke in Ukraine production in 2013-2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Metinvest, owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Ahkmetov, is currently running on stockpiles and plans to import coking coal from its U.S. subsidiary for personal use. Still, the company, as well as other steelmakers like ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, will have to import coke and coking coal from countries like Poland and Australia. The Pokrvosk mine&#x2019;s coking coal supplied 66% of the Ukrainian steel manufacturers with coking coal in 2024, providing the coal to all but one steel maker in the country. Ukraine made up the rest through imports &#x2014; 1.2 million tons of coking coal and 700,000 tons of coke, according to the GMK center. Without the mine in Pokrovsk, Ukraine needs to find a replacement to plug a nearly 3 million ton deficit. While there are other coking coal reserves in Ukraine, they are unexplored, and establishing a new mine like Pokrovsk could cost up to $10 billion, said Stanislav Zinchenko, CEO of the GMK Center. That&#x2019;s an investment Ukrainian steel companies can&#x2019;t afford right now. Coke production facilities are also required to extract the coke from coking coal but many have been damaged or occupied, like in Avdiivka, said Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist at the Center for Economic Strategy (CES). There are five remaining facilities in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, but not all are in good shape and have old machinery, like the Zaporizhzhia plant. A balance of imports of both coke and coking coal is the only option to keep Ukraine&#x2019;s steel facilities operational. Up until 2022, Russia was Ukraine&#x2019;s largest coke source. Unsurprisingly, that has changed in recent years and Poland made up 85% of Ukraine&#x2019;s coke imports in 2024. Poland also provides some coking coal, although the majority comes overseas from the U.S. and Australia.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&#x201C;Theoretically, Ukraine can increase coke imports approximately by 1 million tons from Poland and other countries, as well as the imports of coking coal by 2-3 million tons,&#x201D; said Stanislav Zinchenko, CEO of the GMK Center. &#x201C;But the economic feasibility of such supplies is under question,&#x201D; he added. The Ukrainian steel industry has shrunk by 3.5 times since 2021. Imports will have a 30% markup and put extra pressure on the already low margins, according to Oxford Economics, an analyst group. For example, each ton of Australian coking coal comes with an additional $50 price tag to cover transportation costs, increasing steel production costs by 11%, said Zinchenko. Imports also take much longer to reach producers and depend on the season. The delivery time for European coal can take up to three weeks in the winter or two weeks in the summer. For overseas imports, it can be over a month and a half before Ukrainian companies get the product, according to ArcellorMittal Kryvyi Rih. There could likely be limitations on imports from neighboring Poland, which transports coal via railway, said Kalenkov. Its constrained export capabilities will mean trade flows to Ukraine will &#x201C;take time to reorganize,&#x201D; said Oxford Economics. Poland&#x2019;s largest coke producer, JSW, is also struggling to recover its coking coal and coke outputs this year after suffering several setbacks recently including fires at its mines, said Siew Hua Seah, head of Ferrous Pricing at Argus Media, a market analyst group. Instead, Indonesia is emerging as a serious competitor in the global market and could be an option for Ukraine. India recently imposed coke restrictions which means Indonesia will become &#x201C;more aggressive&#x201D; on the global coke market and its prices are already very competitive, she said. Coking coal &amp; coke in Ukraine imports in 2013-2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Metinvest told the Kyiv Independent that while it will import coking coal from its U.S. subsidiary and other countries, transport costs will be an additional burden. Ultimately, this will result in bigger costs for Ukrainian steel or weaker margins for producers, said Oxford Economics. With global steel prices currently at a low point due to China&#x2019;s dumping, &#x201C;reduced competitiveness will be a headwind for a recovery in Ukraine&apos;s steel production while hostilities persist,&#x201D; Oxford Economics told the Kyiv Independent. Despite the hard hit to the metallurgy industry, it still remains a cornerstone of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and contributed to 5.7% of Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP in 2023. The result for 2024 is likely greater as steel production grew by 21% year-on-year thanks to the opening of the Black Sea to metallurgy exports. But growth dipped starting in September of last year. Before the Pokrvosk mine closed, the forecast for 2025 was a 9% decline. Without the mine, steel production could fall to 2-3 million tons, a precipitous drop from the 7.5 million tons produced last year. This could impact 1% of Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP, according to Oxford Economics. Metinvest is a major taxpayer and paid nearly Hr 20 billion ($479 million) last year. The company will lose an asset valued at around $1.8 billion pre-war and brought in Hr 5.9 billion ($141 million) in the first nine months of 2024. Overall, the closure of the mine will not be much more detrimental to the multi-billion dollar company than the problems already caused by the war. Metinvest has other options, such as steel production at its EU and U.K. facilities, and it also exports iron ore, which has higher margins than steel and is helping keep Ukraine&#x2019;s metallurgy industry afloat. The company told the Kyiv Independent that it is too early to calculate the economic consequences but imports will impact the group&#x2019;s results and efficiency.

(Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg/Getty Images)While Ukraine will have to pay more for imports of coke and coking coal, prices for coke and coking coal are at multi-year lows amid an oversupplied market and low demand. Ukraine&#x2019;s imports this year are unlikely to reach anywhere near pre-war levels, when coking coal imports reached 11.5 million tons. Global prices won&#x2019;t be significantly impacted, said Oxford Economics. This is good news for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction projects which will require steel. For now, construction is largely on pause across the country due to hostilities although that could change once a ceasefire or peace deal is negotiated and steel demand skyrockets. This may cause prices for raw materials to spike slightly, although even higher prices for coke and coking coal won&#x2019;t inflate reconstruction costs hugely. &#x201C;Coke&apos;s share in production costs of steel products could be up 30-40%, but the price of imported coal is not twice higher than domestic coal,&#x201D; Zinchenko said. There are supplies of coking coal in western Ukraine which will require hefty investment in the billions of dollars. But few are willing to take the risk while hostilities are ongoing yet that may change in peacetime. If Ukraine cannot produce enough steel itself, which seems likely, it will need to import steel to meet the demand when reconstruction happens. Imported steel from countries like Turkey could cost an extra 0.02 euros a ton per kilometer, said Landa. That would add to the hefty reconstruction costs, already valued at close to $500 billion. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-the-loss-of-a-critical-donbas-coal-mine-means-for-ukraines-war-torn-steel-sectorukraines-steel-sector-looks-abroad-after-loss-of-critical-donbas-coal-mine/	2025-02-05T10:59:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2186583565.jpg
Trump administration may present plan next week to end war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team may present a plan to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 5, citing its undisclosed sources. Keith Kellogg, special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is expected to present Trump&apos;s plan at the conference, Bloomberg reported, citing its sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The sources did not specify the format or the depth of the discussions after the presentation. Kellogg confirmed his participation in the conference on X on Feb. 5, writing: &quot;As the U.S. president&apos;s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, I look forward to speaking about Donald Trump&apos;s goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ll meet with America&apos;s allies who are ready to work with us,&quot; he added. Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s strategy in the Russia-Ukraine war, has defined the &quot;near term&quot; end to the war as 100 days out from the inauguration and said it was his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution by that point. Talking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed that Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war that entails &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering positive initiatives for both. Kellogg is also expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-may-present-plan-to-end-war-in-ukraine-next-week-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-05T10:51:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
What I can offer my motherland:' Ukrainian Jews translate the Torah into their national language for first time	When Oleg Rostovtsev hovered between life and death after a serious operation last April, he asked friends and family to do something that, until recently, had been impossible &#x2014; to pray for him by reading the Tehillim, the Hebrew Book of Psalms, in Ukrainian. Hebrew or Ukrainian, he requested, just not Russian. &#x201C;For someone who is sick, someone who is in trouble, you have to do something. We (Jews) read the Tehillim. If we don&#x2019;t know Hebrew, why should we read the Tehillim in the language of an aggressor?&#x201D; said Rostovtsev, a prominent member of Ukraine&#x2019;s Jewish community and well-known local journalist and historian. Ukraine is the birthplace of the Hasidic Jewish movement, played a key role in the development of Yiddish literature, and has deep roots in Jewish history stretching back more than a thousand years. Yet crucial sacred texts &#x2014; including the Torah &#x2014; have never been translated into Ukrainian. Only recently has this started to change, through the efforts of Jewish Ukrainians. Although their work began in part prior to 2022, it has radically expanded and accelerated after Russia&#x2019;s invasion.

(Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent)While religious texts are often the most widely translated texts on the planet, the absence of Ukrainian translations of Jewish texts is a consequence of the long-lasting effects of the Holocaust and Soviet rule and repression on Jewish life in Ukraine. The single most destructive event on the Ukrainian Jewish population remains the Holocaust, when historians estimate over one million Jews were killed in Ukraine. But before and after World War II, repressive Soviet policies and antisemitism took their toll as well, undermining Jewish cultural identity. Russification efforts pushed Jewish and non-Jewish Ukrainians alike to switch to the Russian language. And, even after Ukraine gained its independence and Jewish life began to revitalize, the Russian language provided a bridge for a still weakened Jewish community to millions of other Russian-speaking Jews in former USSR states, the U.S., and Israel. Many Jewish communities today are centered in the eastern regions of Dnipro and Odesa, where the Russian language has historically been more prevalent than in western Ukraine. &#x201C;The inertia of the Russian language in the Jewish environment is quite powerful,&#x201D; said Leonid Finberg, a sociologist and director of the Center for Studies of East European Jewish Culture and History in Kyiv. But Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine has galvanized efforts to provide Ukrainian-language Jewish texts to those seeking to deepen their national identity or sever ties to Russia. Work for Ukrainian translators has &#x201C;doubled, maybe tripled&#x201D; since the full-scale invasion began, estimates Inna Zerkal, a member of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Ukraine&#x2019;s (FJCU) team dedicated to translating classical Jewish literature into Ukrainian.

(Markus Scholz/picture alliance via Getty Images)The prayers read by Rostovtsev&#x2019;s friends are one of several new translations spearheaded by the FJCU who, among other groups, are working to make Jewish texts available in the country&#x2019;s national language. Translators work through power outages and tote laptops to bunkers. The printing presses publishing their work in Kharkiv have come under barrage from missiles. But because of the country&#x2019;s history, the greatest challenge, say those leading the project, has been gathering translators and editors who have a deep knowledge of Jewish religion and texts as well as fluent enough Ukrainian to capture the nuances and sacred meanings of holy texts. Despite these challenges, these efforts have already borne fruit in just a few years. For Passover last year, Ukrainians were able to read the holiday&#x2019;s sacred text, the Haggadah, in Ukrainian for the first time. Several children&#x2019;s books about Hanukkah were printed just before the winter holiday, and thousands of copies of the Tehillim are already in circulation. Many of these Tehillim copies have been delivered to Jewish fighters on the front lines, says FCJU Chaplain Yakov Sinyakov, brought by volunteers along with food, generators, and protective equipment. &#x201C;The soldiers carry these books with them, in tanks and in their pockets.&#x201D; FCJU Chaplain Yakov Sinyakov with a pocket-sized Tehillim in Dnipro, Ukraine, on Dec. 11, 2024. (Chris Jones / The Kyiv Independent) &#x201C;It is specially made in such a format that it can be carried with you,&#x201D; he said, displaying a palm-sized copy. &#x201C;The soldiers carry these books with them, in tanks and in their pockets.&#x201D; And now, over a thousand draft copies of the newly translated Torah are circulating in sections for feedback and editing ahead of an official printing later this year. &#x201C;Those who fight on the front, those who are in the rear, they simply do not want to watch YouTube in Russian, nor read books in Russian, nor have anything to do with the Russian language,&#x201D; said Rostovtsev, who himself began switching to Ukrainian in 2016, two years after the Russian invasion of Crimea. &#x201C;Many people say that they do not want the Russian language &#x2014; which, for example, I was raised in &#x2014; to be passed to the next generation,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I want my grandchildren to go to synagogue so that my grandchildren have a Jewish identity. And when they come, there should be a Torah in Ukrainian.&#x201D; Beyond responding to the Jewish community&#x2019;s needs, however, Rostovtsev sees the translation as important for fighting anti-semitism by making the Jewish religion more accessible to more non-Jews. &#x201C;When you understand something, you don&#x2019;t feel that it&#x2019;s something so new and unpleasant. People don&#x2019;t like when something is not clear,&#x201D; he said. Not everyone saw the reasoning behind the translation project right away, said Rabbi Levy Engelsman, who heads the FJCU&#x2019;s publishing department. Some initially felt the existing Russian translations were more practical for the community. When he proposed a new push for Ukrainian translations of holy texts at the start of the full-scale invasion, an acquaintance of his said he didn&#x2019;t see the point.

(Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;Half a year passed, and this same person is not only interested, but he became a sponsor&#x201D; of the project, said Engelsman, who expects a final version of the Torah to be printed in the coming months. &#x201C;Today, no one asks whether it is necessary at all. It is clear to everyone that we have to do it. It will happen, and we will work on it.&#x201D; Translating the Torah has far less wiggle room than, say, translating Hamlet or The Great Gatsby. &#x201C;Every word in the Torah has a certain meaning. If you distort this meaning even a little, the meaning of the whole text, the whole message to people, is lost,&#x201D; said Zerkal, the translator. While there is no official process for approving a new translation of the Torah, a group of rabbis oversees the project and consults on difficult passages and decisions. Converting a Russian version into Ukrainian might have been simpler, but they determined that starting from the original Hebrew would bring the final version closer to the original meaning. Every translation, after all, is a series of compromises. &#x201C;Russian and Ukrainian are different languages. They have different idioms, different pronunciations of verbs,&#x201D; explained Shaul Melamed, who volunteers his time as an editor on the Torah translation. &#x201C;There are many idioms that you can use in Ukraine that are much closer to the original Hebrew meanings.&#x201D; Melamed worked remotely, editing his portions of the text on weekends and evenings after he finished his IT job, one of a team of around ten focused on the Torah. He consulted rabbinical commentaries on spiritual nuances, read translations in English and Russian to see what decisions their editors made, and &#x2014; when he got stuck &#x2014; called friends and acquaintances for advice. From where he lives in Hungary after fleeing the war with his family, he says it helped him stay connected to Ukraine: &#x201C;This is part of what I can offer to my motherland.&#x201D; Russian was not always the main language for Jews in Ukraine. At the start of the twentieth century, many Ukrainian Jews lived in villages and small towns, where they mostly spoke Yiddish and Ukrainian. That changed over the century. Russian became the dominant language for Jews in Ukraine through relocation to cities, Soviet Russification pressure, and the devastation of the Holocaust. Before the Holocaust, Ukraine had been one of the largest Jewish centers in Europe. In Ukraine alone, researchers estimate that over a million Jews were killed &#x2014; potentially as high as 1.6 million. Their numbers further shrunk during Soviet rule through antisemitic discrimination and religious suppression. &#x201C;The few synagogues that remained of the thousands of synagogues that were in Ukraine, they were very weak. People were persecuted for going to synagogue,&#x201D; said Finberg, the sociologist. &#x201C;Jewish schools were liquidated and therefore the community, as a national community, began to be restored only in the late 70s and in the early 80s of the last century.&#x201D; A local Orthodox Jewish man writes the Torah at the Menorah Centre, said to be the world&#x2019;s largest Jewish community center, in Dnipro, Ukraine, on March 24, 2022. (Emre Caylak / AFP via Getty Images)Estimates vary, but many believe the number of Jews today who call Ukraine home stands somewhere in the tens of thousands. As a result, people fluent in both the Ukrainian and Hebrew languages are rare, said Finberg. The shift to Ukrainian has not been easy for many who&#x2019;ve spent their entire lives practicing their religion in Russian, Hebrew, and, in the case of some who immigrated to Ukraine from abroad, other languages. Rabbi Meir Stambler, chairman of the FCJU, takes classes twice a week. &#x201C;To change a language is pretty difficult. But even the ones that continue speaking Russian, they want their children to speak Ukrainian,&#x201D; he says. But the war has broken norms for every community in Ukraine. Stambler recalls using his phone on Shabbat, the holy day of rest, for the first time in his life when the war broke out. The FCJU was coordinating evacuations, so in this case, it was a matter of life and death &#x2014; which overrides the traditional prohibition for Orthodox Jews of using the telephone on Shabbat. In total, the organization evacuated 30,000 people, regardless of religion: &#x201C;whoever came and needed help.&#x201D; &#x201C;So many Jews fled the country, but what we have now is very interesting. There are new people that have started coming to synagogue,&#x201D; Stambler notes. Many have Jewish roots but were raised in the communist era without religion. Despite the war&#x2019;s devastation, Stambler pauses to reflect on the ways that it has fueled the Jewish community and deepened its connections to the rest of Ukrainian society. &#x201C;The Lubavitcher Rabbi taught us to find in every change &#x2014; in anything we see in the world &#x2014; to find the positive,&#x201D; he said, referencing Menachem Mendel Schneerson, one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 1900s. &#x201C;Of course, you see the negative as well. But we must see the positive.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-i-can-offer-my-motherland-ukrainian-jews-translate-the-torah-into-their-national-language-for-the-first-time/	2025-02-05T10:45:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195872261.jpg
Ukraine's Defense Ministry introduces robotic units into army	The Defense Ministry is launching an initiative to increase the use of unmanned ground systems in the Ukrainian army, introducing robotics units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 5. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in unmanned vehicles, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, revolutionizing warfare. Ukraine is increasing the production of unmanned ground systems and deploying full-fledged robotic units as part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; combat brigades on the front line, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote on Facebook. &quot;We continue transforming the Ukrainian Armed Forces into a modern army with a technological advantage over the enemy. Our goal is to create an army in which innovative technologies help to perform the most dangerous tasks while saving the lives of our defenders,&quot; Umerov said. The project is the result of tests conducted in cooperation with the military since the summer of 2024, he added. Unmanned ground systems have proven to perform several tasks on the battlefield, including offensive and defensive activities, evacuation of the wounded, logistical support for units, and mining and demining areas, according to the minister. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-aims-to-scale-up-use-of-unmanned-ground-systems-introducing-full-fledged-robotic-units/	2025-02-05T09:33:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2149420738.jpg
Why does Trump want Ukraine’s ‘rare earths’?	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 3 he was looking to cut a deal with Ukraine by giving the war-torn country weapons and aid in return for its &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; But what exactly did Trump mean and what does Ukraine have to offer to the U.S?	https://kyivindependent.com/why-does-trump-want-ukraines-rare-earths/	2025-02-05T09:08:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0003.JPG
Next Ramstein summit to be held on Feb. 12 under UK chairmanship, media reports	The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Feb. 12 under the chairmanship of the U.K. instead of the U.S., Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Feb. 5, citing its undisclosed sources. Following Donald Trump&apos;s administration&apos;s takeover of the White House, the future format of Ramstein&apos;s meetings remained uncertain. Trump has also signaled his intention to break with the current U.S. strategy concerning Ukraine. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in January the next summit would be held in Brussels before the Munich Security Conference scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Pistorius did not disclose the meeting format, adding that it depended on the future U.S. administration. Some of Ramstein&apos;s functions, with the exception of organizing the Ramstein format meetings, have already been transferred to NATO. The NSATU (NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine) mission has been launched in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate the fulfillment of the countries&apos; pledges to supply weapons. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Jan. 9 was the group&apos;s 25th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. During the last meeting in the Ramstein format, one of the major topics of discussion was the protection of Ukraine&apos;s airspace, including providing new air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-summit-to-be-held-on-feb-12-under-uk-chairmanship-instead-of-us-media-reports/	2025-02-05T08:22:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
Ukraine extends martial law until May 9	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law the extension of martial law and general mobilization from Feb. 8 to May 9. Zelensky first declared martial law and general mobilization on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia started its full-scale invasionof Ukraine. The measure has been repeatedly extended since then. The president submitted a proposal to the parliament on Jan. 14 to extend martial law and general mobilization for another 90 days. Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted to approve the extension one day later. The extension of general mobilization and martial law until May 9 coincides with the celebration of Victory Day in Russia. The Kremlin heavily leverages the annual Victory Day celebrations to project military strength and propagate its narrative of Soviet heroism in World War II. Under martial law, Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60, with some exceptions, are not allowed to leave the country as they may be called up for military service. Due to martial law, Ukraine is also unable to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in accordance with the existing legislation. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-extends-martial-law-mobilization-until-may-9/	2025-02-05T07:05:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192471458.jpg
Russian intelligence behind deadly Rivne draft office bombing, Ukraine's SBU claims	Russia recruited the attacker responsible for a deadly explosion at a military enlistment office in Rivne, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 5, revealing details of the investigation. The bombing on Feb. 1 killed the suspected perpetrator and injured eight service members. Russian operatives recruited the man and then remotely detonated explosives, removing him as an &quot;&apos;unnecessary&apos; witness,&quot; the SBU said. According to the investigation, the attacker was a 21-year-old unemployed man from Zhytomyr Oblast who sought quick money on Telegram channels. Russian intelligence services allegedly recruited him online and offered him payment for carrying out an attack. The revelation follows a series of attacks on military enlistment officers, including explosions at draft offices in Rivne and Pavlohrad that injured several service members. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Another explosion near a military enlistment office in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured. The circumstances of the explosion are being investigated. Following Russia&apos;s instructions, the perpetrator of the Rivne attack arrived in the city with an improvised explosive device (IED) concealed in a tourist backpack. The device was linked to a mobile phone remotely controlled by Russian operatives, the SBU said. Upon entering the military enlistment office, the suspect held another phone with a &quot;remote control&quot; function. Russian handlers monitored the operation through the phone&apos;s camera and detonated the IED remotely as soon as the agent stepped inside. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv has struggled to mobilize troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-uncovers-russian-backed-recruitment-behind-deadly-rivne-draft-office-attack/	2025-02-05T06:16:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/SBU.jpg
Ukraine brings back 150 POWs from Russian captivity in prisoner swap	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukraine brought back 150 Ukrainian service members from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 5, marking another prisoner exchange between Kyiv and Moscow. The released Ukrainian captives included members of the Navy, the Air Force, the Airborne Troops, the National Guard, the State Border Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces, and a police officer, according to the president. &quot;They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common: they fought for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. Concurrently, Russia announced the return of 150 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) from Ukrainian captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-brings-back-150-ukrainians-from-russian-captivity-in-prisoner-swap/	2025-02-05T05:58:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-05_15-54-25.jpg
US 'not going to eliminate foreign aid,' Rubio says amid USAID shutdown push	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that foreign aid should serve U.S. interests rather than function as charity, emphasizing that the Trump administration does not intend to halt all international assistance. &quot;I continue to support foreign aid. But foreign aid is not charity. It exists for the purpose of advancing the national interest of the United States,&quot; Rubio said at a press conference in Costa Rica. He added that the U.S. would not eliminate foreign aid but would ensure it benefits &quot;trusted partners and allies.&quot; The statement comes after the Trump administration halted almost all foreign assistance for 90 days pending review and growing uncertainties about the fate of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the country&apos;s chief foreign assistance arm. According to a directive issued on Feb. 4, USAID employees worldwide will be placed on administrative leave starting Feb. 7. For personnel stationed abroad, the agency, in coordination with the State Department, is drafting a plan to arrange and fund their return travel to the U.S., with exceptions for those performing &quot;mission-critical functions.&quot; Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. Rubio said the temporary aid freeze aims to review and restructure foreign assistance, claiming that the Trump administration struggled to obtain details about specific programs as USAID &quot;refused to tell us anything.&quot; Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. On Feb. 3, the White House declared that &quot;under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; accusing USAID of misusing taxpayer funds on unnecessary projects. The &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; list included nothing related to Ukraine.

Trump's team split over how to pressure Putin to end war in Ukraine, NBC reports	The administration of President Donald Trump is split over how to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin and bring him to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine, NBC News reported on Feb. 5. Citing U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the outlet said Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, are pushing for the White House to use its leverage over Russia to force Putin to back down. Without naming individuals, NBC News said others in the administration are in favor of withdrawing military support from Kyiv in order to hasten the end of the war, effectively forcing Ukraine to capitulate. The U.S. does have significant leverage over Russia in economic, military, and diplomatic terms, but questions remain over his willingness to use it. Russia&#x2019;s economy is showing signs of weakness, making Putin more vulnerable than ever to additional economic pressure like sanctions. Ramped-up support for Ukraine on the battlefield could add to Russia&#x2019;s mounting losses and further incentivize dealmaking, as would uniting support among allies and squeezing Russia on the diplomatic stage. President Volodymyr &#x200B;&#x200B;Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. As Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises. Kellogg was officially appointed into his new role on Feb. 3. &quot;We made a lot of progress on Russia-Ukraine,&quot; Trump reportedly said after signing the decree without providing further details. Kellogg has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage with Putin, calling former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin a &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; Trump&apos;s envoy said he believes the new U.S. president can broker a satisfactory deal for both Putin and Zelensky. Kellogg told Reuters on Feb. 1 that Ukraine&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the full-scale war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that holding elections during wartime would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. The Trump administration is debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. Kellogg also suggested using frozen Russian assets to purchase American weapons for Ukraine, as reported by Fox News on Jan. 24. Zelensky recently emphasized the need to end the war diplomatically in 2025, suggesting that a Trump administration could accelerate the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-split-over-how-to-pressure-putin-to-end-war-in-ukraine-nbc-reports/	2025-02-05T05:21:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Ukraine offering gas storage facilities for US LNG to boost Europe's energy security	Ukraine could store U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in its underground facilities to bolster bilateral cooperation and Europe&apos;s energy security, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Feb. 5 at a press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukraine has powerful underground gas storage facilities, and we have the potential for close, mutually beneficial cooperation in this area,&quot; the minister said during the press conference with his U.K. counterpart, David Lammy. Sybiha&apos;s remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks Ukrainian rare earths as a condition for continued aid to Ukraine. Sybiha suggested that energy cooperation could be another key component of the bilateral relationship. &quot;The range of common interests and mutually beneficial cooperation is not limited to these resources. For example, we see enormous potential &#x2014; especially after ending Russian gas transit through Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2014; in the possibility of purchasing LNG gas from the U.S.,&quot; Sybiha said. The minister emphasized that the development of energy infrastructure presents opportunities for American businesses to invest in Ukraine&apos;s gas transportation system, but it also gives Kyiv a chance to become a guarantor of energy security in Europe. &quot;This is not only an economically beneficial partnership but also a strategic decision that will strengthen transatlantic relations and make Ukraine a key energy security hub for the entire region,&quot; he said. Ukraine did not extend an agreement with Russia on natural gas transit through its territory that expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&apos;s war. Zelensky has reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s openness to mining rare earths with international partners during a press briefing on Feb. 4. His victory plan, first presented in 2024, includes a provision for foreign investment in Ukraine&apos;s mining industry. Trump has not specified which rare earths the U.S. seeks, but he has suggested that Kyiv is ready to cooperate. Ukraine possesses significant reserves of critical minerals, including titanium, which is used in aerospace and defense, and lithium, which is essential for electric vehicle batteries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offering-lng-storage-to-us/	2025-02-05T05:10:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg
Kellogg to discuss Trump's Ukraine strategy at Munich Security Conference	Keith Kellogg, U.S. Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on Feb. 5 he plans to attend the Munich Security Conference next week to discuss ending the war. &quot;I look forward to speaking about (Trump&apos;s) goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X. &quot;I&#x2019;ll meet with America&#x2019;s allies who are ready to work with us.&quot; Backing up his pledge to broker a swift peace deal, Trump recently said that Washington is leading &quot;very constructive&quot; talks on Ukraine and that his administration is in touch with both Kyiv and Moscow. Neither the president nor his Ukraine envoy provided details on how they plan to broker an end to the war. Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s strategy in the Russia-Ukraine war, is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials. Trump has also revealed he intends to meet in person with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump&apos;s past criticism of Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and his open sympathies for the Russian leader has sparked concerns he might reduce assistance or cut a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Since taking office, the U.S. president has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, threatening tariffs and sanctions unless Putin agrees to negotiate. Trump has been largely evasive on whether he intends to continue providing military support to Ukraine, though he recently suggested Kyiv could secure continued assistance in exchange for the country&apos;s rare earths. Reuters reported on Feb. 3 that the U.S. briefly halted security aid before restarting it again for unclear reasons. Talking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed that Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war that entails &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering positive initiatives for both. Kellogg will not be the only top official of the Trump administration attending the Munich conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Organizers recently confirmed that Vice President JD Vance will also be in attendance.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-to-discuss-trumps-ukraine-peace-plans-at-munich-security-conference/	2025-02-05T04:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Explosion reported near Khmelnytskyi Oblast draft office — 1 killed, 4 injured	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An explosion near a military enlistment office in the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi in Khmelnytskyi Oblast on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured, Suspilne reported, citing a police spokesperson. Investigators are reportedly working on the scene. Further details on the cause of the explosion and its full consequences have not been provided at the time of publication. The incident comes following several attacks against enlistment officers over the past few days, including explosions at the draft offices in Rivne and Pavlohrad that injured several service members. Another draft officer was shot dead in Poltava Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Earlier this week, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi condemned the recent attacks, calling for a full investigation and punishment of the perpetrators. &quot;We expect a full and comprehensive investigation of these crimes. The perpetrators must be brought to justice,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine has faced significant challenges in mobilizing troops to compensate for losses and rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-reported-near-khmelnytskyi-oblast-draft-office/	2025-02-05T04:07:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg
UK pledges $69 million to boost Ukraine's resilience, grain deliveries to Syria	The U.K. will provide Ukraine with 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new humanitarian and economic assistance to promote a long-term partnership between the two nations, the British government announced on Feb. 5. &quot;This funding for social, humanitarian, and energy programs will strengthen our resilience. And this assistance is very timely right now,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at a press conference with his British counterpart, David Lammy, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Lammy is visiting Kyiv to discuss continued U.K. support for Ukraine as it is about to enter the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The U.K. official is expected to assess firsthand how British aid is assisting Ukraine on the battlefield and in civilian infrastructure recovery. The new funding is part of a broader 100-year partnership agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16. In addition to the financial aid, the U.K. will allocate 3 million pounds ($3.7 million) to supply Ukrainian grain and other food products to Syria, working with the World Food Program. &quot;Unlike Russian grain supplies to the brutal Assad regime, which attempted to buy favor while burdening Syria with costly debt, this planned support will provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in Syria,&quot; the British government&apos;s statement read. London previously committed a record 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024, including advanced weapons systems and munitions. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26 billion pound ($2.7 billion) loan under the G7 program will also be released to fund major procurement projects for Ukraine&apos;s defense. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets, marking another step in the West&apos;s efforts to use Russia&apos;s frozen funds to finance Ukraine&apos;s war effort and recovery. &quot;We have agreed on the need to continue using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In the near future, we will begin utilizing funds from the U.K. loan of more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) sourced from these assets,&quot; Sybiha said.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-69-million-to-boost-ukraines-resilience-grain-deliveries-to-syria/	2025-02-05T03:38:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197174889.jpg
Russia ready to negotiate despite Zelensky's 'legitimacy problems,' Kremlin spox claims	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated Russia&apos;s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is illegitimate on Feb. 5 but said Moscow remains open to negotiations. Peskov&apos;s comments follow Zelensky&apos;s statement in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan that he was willing to sit at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin if it was the only way to end the war. &quot;Mr. Zelensky has big problems de jure in terms of his legitimacy, but even so, the Russian side remains open to negotiations,&quot; Peskov claimed. The spokesperson also called Zelensky&apos;s recent comments on negotiations &quot;empty words,&quot; adding that they must be based on an actual &quot;readiness and desire.&quot; Russia has widely used the claim of Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy as part of its propaganda campaign to discredit Ukraine&apos;s government, arguing that Zelensky has served past his five-year term without holding new elections. Ukrainian legal experts and officials have dismissed the narrative as false and unfounded, pointing to the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law and that a significant portion of the Ukrainian population is under occupation and, therefore, cannot vote. Putin previously claimed that Zelensky had no right to sign any peace agreements, referencing the Ukrainian president&apos;s decree on Sept. 30, 2022, which banned negotiations with the Russian leader in response to Moscow&apos;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Zelensky clarified on Jan. 26 that the decree only applied to other Ukrainian officials, not himself. The discussion of potential negotiations comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, pledging to broker a swift settlement in the next few months. Zelensky, while saying that Ukraine was ready to end the &quot;hot stage&quot; of the war, suggested that if NATO membership is not an option, the U.S. should provide Ukraine with alternative security guarantees, including nuclear weapons, to prevent renewed Russian aggression. &quot;In general, such statements, such utterances, border on insanity,&quot; Peskov said in response to Zelensky&apos;s remarks. Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022. In November 2024, Putin approved updates to Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, outlining conditions under which Moscow could justify a nuclear strike, including aggression against Russia and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state.	https://kyivindependent.com/peskov-on-zelensky-negotiations/	2025-02-05T03:22:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
UK doesn't see Russia being 'serious about negotiations, peace'	London does not see indications that Russia is ready for serious negotiations about peace in Ukraine, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Feb. 5 at a press conference in Kyiv attended by the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We do not see (that) Russia is serious about negotiations and serious about peace,&quot; Lammy said alongside his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. &quot;And the conditions that were set out by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin last year was not any basis on which you could seriously expect a sovereign country to begin negotiations.&quot; Putin issued an ultimatum last June under which Ukraine was to entirely withdraw from the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as a condition for peace talks. Moscow illegally declared annexation of the four regions in September 2022 despite not fully occupying them. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to broker a swift settlement. President Volodymyr Zelensky concurred that Kyiv would seek an end to the war this year but urged partners to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength. In a surprise turn, the Ukrainian president even recently acknowledged the possibility of sitting at the negotiating table with Putin if necessary to achieve peace. &quot;We in the United Kingdom have been at the forefront of supplying Ukraine with the military capability,&quot; Lammy said. &quot;The United Kingdom, of course, plays its full part to ensure that Putin does not come back.&quot; The U.K.&apos;s top diplomat is visiting Ukraine shortly after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to ramp up military support, promising more assistance in 2025 than ever before. London previously announced plans to deliver unprecedented military assistance to Ukraine this year, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. The British-Ukrainian cooperation was further cemented in January by the 100-year strategic partnership agreement, a wide-ranging deal that encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-doesnt-see-russia-being-serious-about-negotiations-peace/	2025-02-05T02:58:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2171444035.jpg
Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in December struck by Russian Pantsir missile, source tells Reuters	The Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in Kazakhstan in December after diverting from the Russian airspace was struck by a Russian Pantsir air defense missile, an undisclosed Azerbaijani official told Reuters in comments published on Feb. 4. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane was flying from Baku to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic before suddenly changing course and crashing on Dec. 25 near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. The source revealed to Reuters that the Azerbaijani side possesses a fragment of a Russian Pantsir missile extracted from the crashed plane, adding that the analysis is underway. Kazakhstan&apos;s authorities on Feb. 4 released preliminary results of their analysis of available data, including the plane&apos;s black boxes. The conclusions pointed to a number of holes and dents in the aircraft and a collision with &quot;foreign metal objects.&quot; Baku has previously accused Russia of accidentally shooting down the plane and demanded an admission of guilt and reparations. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev soon after the crash, apologizing for the incident taking place in Russian airspace but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev later criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. He also criticized Russia for failing to close the airspace during a reported drone attack and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-airliner-hit-by-russian-pantsir-missile-before-december-crash-source-tells-reuters/	2025-02-05T02:30:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190840075.jpg
38 countries announce 'major progress' on tribunal for Russian leadership	A coalition of 38 countries, including all EU members, announced on Feb. 4 that they had made &quot;significant progress&quot; toward establishing a special tribunal to prosecute Russian leadership for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, Euronews reported. &quot;No one from Russia and no one from Russia&apos;s leadership is untouchable,&quot; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat. The tribunal, set to operate within the Council of Europe, will focus on Russia&apos;s political and military leaders, including President Vladimir Putin. &quot;To wait is not an option. We must really act as fast as possible. And we will do the best way to try to finish the work this year,&quot; said Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset. Legal experts are reportedly drafting a statute to define the tribunal&apos;s jurisdiction, with the document expected to be signed in April at the 14th meeting of the coalition participants. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been a strong advocate for the tribunal, seeking to hold Putin accountable for launching the full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. Ukrainian authorities have documented thousands of war crimes by Russian forces, including deliberate attacks on civilians, cultural sites, and medical institutions, as well as cases of torture and forced deportations. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has already issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official overseeing the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. In March 2024, the ICC also issued warrants for two Russian military commanders for strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure during the winter of 2022-2023. Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide &#x2014; charges that apply to individuals at all levels of a military conflict &#x2014; the crime of aggression is a charge that can be brought exclusively against the top leadership of an aggressor state.	https://kyivindependent.com/38-countries-push-forward-with-tribunal-to-prosecute-russian-leadership-over-aggression-euronews-reports/	2025-02-05T02:16:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1475813059.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian oil facility, Buk air defense system overnight, military claims	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian oil facility in Krasnodar Krai and a Buk air defense system in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight on Feb. 5, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. An attack carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Defense Forces set fire to the Albashneft oil facility in Novominskaya in southwestern Russia, according to the statement. Earlier the same day, Krasnodar Krai authorities reported a Ukrainian drone attack that started a fire at an unspecified oil depot that allegedly contained a &quot;residual amount&quot; of petroleum product. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;The hit has been confirmed,&quot; the General Staff said, describing the facility as a &quot;mini-refinery&quot; involved in the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel for Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of damage to the facility is being determined. The General Staff also reported a successful hit against the Buk system in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, adding that &quot;damage to the target was recorded.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. Earlier this week, Ukrainian drone attacks reportedly targeted energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires at the Lukoil oil refinery in Volgograd and the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-buk-air-defense-system-overnight-military-claims/	2025-02-05T02:11:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Tank.jpg
US provides 30% of Ukraine's weapons, domestic production covers 40%, Zelensky says	Around 40% of the weapons and equipment Ukraine uses on the battlefield are Ukrainian-made, while the U.S. contributes roughly 30%, President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.K. journalist Piers Morgan in an interview published on Feb. 4. &quot;This does not bring tranquility but rather a moral belief that we will not be left empty-handed, of course, without the support of the United States,&quot; Zelensky said. The president nevertheless hinted at serious consequences should Washington decide to withdraw assistance. &quot;The contribution from the United States to Ukraine&apos;s defensive capability and security is now around 30%. You can imagine what would happen to us without this crucial 30%,&quot; Zelensky said amid uncertainty about the Trump administration&apos;s continued support. The U.S. is Ukraine&apos;s largest military aid provider, supplying billions in security assistance since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has been evasive about whether the new president plans to cut support after taking office. Aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign support, Ukraine has ramped up its domestic defense production over the past years. The country&apos;s 2025 budget allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production. Zelensky emphasized that continued assistance from partners remains critical and warned that any disruption in U.S. military aid could have dire consequences. &quot;Unfortunately, some delays occurred, but they eventually arrived, which allowed us to continue supporting our army, our Defense Forces, and... to defend against Russia,&quot; the president said. U.S. support to Kyiv has faced delays due to opposition from congressional Republicans and concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict. A major obstacle in 2023-2024 was a $60 billion aid package caught in congressional gridlock, further complicated by a flawed weapons-tracking system that created confusion over the actual aid delivery.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-ukraine-produces-40-of-its-battlefield-weapons-us-provides-30/	2025-02-05T01:35:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247185184-1678210924hwn53.jpg
‘Donbas is fiction’ — Kateryna Zarembo’s book dismantles Russian myths about Ukraine’s east	For some, Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts evoke images of coal mines, industrial sprawl, and Russian-speaking culture oriented toward Moscow. Yet to accept this as the regions&#x2019; defining reality is to ignore a deeper truth: a Ukrainian heritage that Russia has spent centuries attempting to erase. In the wake of independence, locals &#x2014; navigating the complexities of a democratic transition after decades of authoritarian rule &#x2014; sought to reclaim this identity, fostering a cultural revival that would gradually weave these regions more firmly into the national fabric. But in 2014, war brought that resurgence to a brutal halt. As Russia&apos;s war of aggression continues to devastate cities in both regions and force the remaining locals into occupation under the pretext of &#x201C;protecting&#x201D; the local Russian-speaking population from the Ukrainian government, understanding the true story of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has never been more important. Kateryna Zarembo&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise: Stories of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions from the Early 2000s,&#x201D; now available in English translation, challenges the long-standing Soviet-era myths about Ukraine&#x2019;s east. Drawing from field research conducted leading up to the full-scale invasion, Zarembo illuminates how locals were in the process of reclaiming their regions&#x2019; Ukrainian identity. While Zarembo currently dedicates part of her time to volunteering as a combat medic with the Hospitallers battalion, she is, first and foremost, an academic. &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise&#x201D; reads like a scholarly work, yet the way it is written remains accessible to a broad audience. Her commitment to fieldwork and firsthand interviews makes the book a far more reliable resource on the people of the region than the perspectives of think tanks with opaque funding sources or journalists who parrot Russian talking points. Zarembo&#x2019;s approach ensures that the voices of those in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are heard directly &#x2014; she serves not as an interpreter, but as a conduit for their stories. She opens &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise&#x201D; with a compelling takedown of the term &quot;Donbas,&quot; a label frequently applied to both regions as part of a larger whole. She contends that this historical term not only oversimplifies but also misrepresents the distinct identities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, obscuring the diverse experiences of the people who called them home. A portmanteau of &#x201C;Donets Basin,&#x201D; the term &#x201C;Donbas&#x201D; has been in use since the 19th century and has referred not only to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but also parts of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and even regions of southern Russia. While the term conjures images of sprawling industrial cities for most people, Zarembo references the words of a Luhansk scholar who noted that several districts in his region north of the Siverskyi Donets River were known not for mining, but for their agricultural landscapes. Photo of Yuzovka (Donetsk, Ukraine) in the early 1900s. (HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Men in a factory in Yuzovka (Donetsk, Ukraine), before 1917. (HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)&#x201C;The myth of Donbas deliberately erases the peculiarities of the region at the micro level and portrays it as a homogenous whole,&#x201D; Zarembo writes. &#x201C;In fact, residents of the region would be the first to say that &#x2018;Donbas&#x2019; and &#x2018;the Donetsk and Luhansk regions&#x2019; are not synonymous.&#x201D; The prevalence of the Ukrainian language in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts &#x2014; more than 60% according to a census conducted in the Russian Empire in the late 19th century &#x2014; persisted until the Holodomor man-made famine and Stalinist purges of the 1930s, which marked what Zarembo characterizes as an &quot;all-out&quot; assault on Ukrainian culture. During this period, Ukrainian teachers were branded as &quot;class traitors,&quot; and miners faced arrest for reading so-called &quot;nationalist literature.&quot; &#x201C;The region was too important for the Soviet Union to tolerate its Ukrainian identity. And not only Ukrainian identity: the Soviet myth of Donbas as an &#x2018;All-Union furnace&#x2019; not only rejected other identities, it also denied their very existence, except for heavy industry workers,&#x201D; according to Zarembo. To this day, the most enduring stereotype surrounding both regions is its singular identity as Ukraine&#x2019;s coal-mining heartland. While mine workers enjoyed relatively high salaries until the 1960s, the industry&#x2019;s profitability began to decline in subsequent decades. Lower wages, substandard coal quality compared to international benchmarks, and perilous working conditions shaped by inadequate regulations &#x2014; such was the stark reality of coal mining in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, far removed from its mythologized image. For many young people, mining became a profession of last resort, pursued only when other opportunities failed to materialize. Politicians attempted to perpetuate the &#x201C;miner&#x2019;s myth,&#x201D; into the years of Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, but as Zarembo writes, &#x201C;the coal mined in Donbas was so much higher than the price at which it was sold that the region received regular subsidies from the state budget, which peaked during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych.&#x201D; Coal miners in Ukraine Soviet Republic, 1940s. (Mark Redkin/FotoSoyuz/Getty Images)Under Soviet rule, the pervasiveness of the Russian language in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts was meticulously cultivated through policies that marginalized and stigmatized the Ukrainian language. Yet, as Zarembo astutely observes, linguistic preference in the early 2000s did not serve as a definitive marker of political allegiance. Russian speakers could be patriotic Ukrainians who feel no deep affinity toward Russia, while Ukrainian speakers could be Euro skeptics. These complexities, Zarembo emphasizes, were not unique to Donetsk and Luhansk &#x2014; they were emblematic of broader dynamics throughout Ukraine at that time. The politics of historical memory was a mechanism through which these complexities often had to be navigated. In 2008, a proposal emerged to rename Donetsk National University in honor of Vasyl Stus, the 20th-century poet who grew up in Donetsk and died in a Russian penal colony in 1985. This initiative was championed by the student organization Poshtovkh (&#x201C;Impetus&#x201D; in Ukrainian), which had been founded just two years earlier in 2006, amid a national movement to reembrace Ukraine&#x2019;s historical memory, fostered by then-President Viktor Yushchenko. As one of its members reflects in the book, the group&apos;s mission was clear: &#x201C;We thought if we educated people about the history of the region and explained that Ukrainian culture was not inferior to Russian culture, then we would be contributing to the integration of this region into the general cultural landscape of Ukraine.&#x201D; Stus&#x2019; legacy in Donetsk was one of competing narratives, shaped by whether one&#x2019;s view was oriented toward the past or present. To those still tethered to the Soviet mindset, he was an enemy. But for those who envisioned a free and independent Ukraine, he stood not only as a talented poet but as a hero and martyr for Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle. Poshtovkh members, driven by a desire to honor Stus, collected nearly 1,500 signatures from students and faculty at Donetsk National University, and also earned support at the national level from key figures like Yushchenko. However, their campaign quickly became a flashpoint for regional political tensions. A lawmaker from the pro-Russian Party of Regions proposed instead that the university be named after a former first secretary of the regional Communist Party. Other members of the pro-Russian camp launched a series of heated roundtable discussions against the renaming of the university, all while distributing blue and yellow ribbons &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s national colors &#x2014; as a defensive gesture against charges of anti-patriotism.

(Viktoria Synistra/AFP via Getty Images)The university administration, convinced that the students were &quot;agents&quot; of the Orange Revolution, which had bolstered Yushchenko&#x2019;s political rise, turned the campaign into an ideological battleground. In the end, the administration voted against the renaming, and efforts were made to discredit Poshtovkh in the eyes of the public. The resistance to cultural initiatives in Donetsk might seem baffling at first glance. Poshtovkh, for instance, faced staunch opposition not only when advocating for the renaming of the university but also when attempting to organize a Vertep festival &#x2014; a centuries-old Ukrainian Christmas tradition &#x2014; in the city&#x2019;s central square. As Zarembo points out, this hostility is rooted in the enduring legacy of Soviet myths about Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, myths that relegated culture to an &quot;unnecessary&quot; status for its vision of the industrial Donbas. These narratives, designed to erase local identity, left little room for expressions of Ukrainian heritage, reinforcing a landscape where cultural initiatives were viewed with suspicion. As such, the music, literature, and theater that emerged in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts can only be described as being part of what Zarembo calls an &#x201C;artistic underground&#x201D; or a &#x201C;cultural insurgency.&#x201D; These movements defied entrenched ideologies, striving to rejuvenate their cities and challenge the inertia of post-Soviet stagnation. One of the most prominent examples of cultural reinvention in Donetsk is the Izolyatsia cultural center, founded in 2010 on the site of a former mineral wool factory. The center&#x2019;s creation aimed to transform the factory from an industrial relic into a vibrant hub of social and cultural life. Through its innovative programming, Izolyatsia sought to shift the narrative of the region, using art as a lens for reimagining its identity.

(Dima Sergeev/Izolyatsia Must Speak)Some of Izolyatsia&#x2019;s artistic initiatives included inviting Chinese American artist Cai Guo-Qiang to create portraits of miners using gunpowder, or the art installation &#x201C;Lipstick&#x201D; by Cameroonian-Belgian artist Pascale Marthine Tayou, who dedicated it to the women of the region. A giant metallic red lipstick was installed on the top of the factory chimney, which Russian occupying forces would later blow up when they seized the premises. The Izolyatsia art center&#x2019;s singular, defining event was a Ukrainian literature festival held in late April 2014, despite the outbreak of the Russian invasion earlier that month. In a powerful act of cultural defiance against Russian aggression, some of Ukraine&apos;s most prominent literary figures, including Irena Karpa, Lyubko Deresh, and Kateryna Babkina committed to participating, embodying the resilience of Ukraine&apos;s intellectual and artistic spirit in the face of war. Just months later, the Izolyatsia team, which relocated to Kyiv, received the grim news that the center had been seized by occupying forces, and its invaluable collection of artworks had been destroyed. The site has then been transformed into a notorious prison, infamous for the unspeakable acts of torture committed within its walls. Donetsk-born journalist Stanislav Aseyev&#x2019;s memoir, &#x201C;The Torture Camp on Paradise Street,&#x201D; offers a chilling first-hand account of the brutality he endured during his own imprisonment at Izolyatsia. Much of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has fallen under Russian occupation or been completely ravaged by over a decade of war. It remains unclear when peace will return to both regions as Russia advances along the front line and continues its assault. Yet, as Zarembo observes, these landscapes continue to find ways to evolve in the collective consciousness of Ukrainians, acquiring new meanings even amid all the destruction. A notable example is the Azovstal steel plant in Russian-occupied Mariupol, a site once criticized for its environmental impact. With the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, it was transformed into a powerful symbol of Ukrainian resilience, as outnumbered and outgunned soldiers entrenched themselves there during the Siege of Mariupol.

(Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg via Getty Images)While many of those who sought to innovate Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been driven into exile due to Russia&#x2019;s occupation, they continue to serve their country &#x2014; either by contributing to cultural initiatives from elsewhere in Ukraine or by fighting for the country&#x2019;s future on the front lines. This current period of the war, marked by the targeted devastation of Ukraine&apos;s east, represents yet another chapter in a long history of hardship for Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Yet, as Zarembo suggests, there is always still room for hope. &#x201C;The history of the Ukrainian east demonstrates what this region has suffered from Russia every time it has tried to forge an alternative trajectory of development,&#x201D; Zarembo writes. &#x201C;And the stories in this book confirm what it could have been if not for Russian interference; it had had the ten years the people featured in this book talk about. These stories illustrate what the Ukrainian east can still become.&#x201D; Kateryna Zarembo&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise Stories of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions from the Early 2000s is now available in Tetiana Savchynska&#x2019;s English translation from Academic Studies Press. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article. There is an ever-increasing amount of books about or related to Ukraine available to English-language readers, and I hope my recommendations prove useful when it comes to your next trip to the bookstore.

US leading 'very constructive talks on Ukraine,' Trump says	The U.S. is in contact with both the Russian and Ukrainian leadership about the war, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 4, calling the talks &quot;constructive.&quot; &quot;But we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. And we are talking to the Russians. We&apos;re talking to the Ukrainian leadership,&quot; Trump said during a press conference in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal and end the full-scale war nearing its three-year mark but has not revealed specifics on how he plans to achieve that. Ukraine has said it is in contact with Trump&apos;s team and finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation, including a special presidential envoy, Keith Kellogg. The U.S. president also previously voiced intent to meet in person with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden. Moscow welcomed Trump&apos;s offer but said no concrete plans have been set for the meeting. &quot;This is an absolute slaughter that&apos;s taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine, and we have to stop it... It&apos;s a human tragedy, and we&apos;re going to try very hard to stop it,&quot; Trump said, reiterating his previous claims that the invasion would never have happened if he were in office at the time. Trump&apos;s past criticism of Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and his open sympathies for the Russian leader have sparked concerns he might reduce assistance or cut a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Since taking office, the U.S. president has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, threatening tariffs and sanctions unless Putin agrees to negotiate. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-leading-very-constructive-talks-on-ukraine-trump-says/	2025-02-05T01:03:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197672118.jpg
Ukraine should receive nuclear weapons if NATO entry is delayed, Zelensky says	The U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons, if it is not ready to accept the country into NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published on Feb. 4. &quot;What kind of support package, what kind of missiles? Will they give us nuclear weapons? Then let them give us nuclear weapons,&quot; the president said when talking about possible guarantees instead of quick NATO entry. Zelensky acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession could be delayed &quot;for years or decades,&quot; raising the question of how the country would defend itself. Ukraine applied to join NATO at the outset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge last year that Kyiv&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia continue to resist its entry. Zelensky argued that while the West can supply Ukraine with missiles to deter Russia, their ability to stop Russian nuclear weapons is &quot;a rhetorical question.&quot; &quot;Let&apos;s do this: return (to) us nuclear weapons; give us missile systems; help us finance a million-strong army; or deploy your contingents in parts of our country where we want stability so that people feel safe,&quot; Zelensky said, outlining hypothetical alternatives. The Ukrainian president also pointed to the contradiction in Russia&apos;s justification for its invasion. &quot;Putin invaded because he was afraid that we would become NATO members. Well, we are not NATO members. Get out of our land,&quot; he said. The comments come after Zelensky criticized Ukraine&apos;s 1990s decision to give up its nuclear weapons without receiving robust security guarantees in return. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arsenal stationed on its territory and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In exchange, the U.S., U.K., and Russia provided security assurances. Twenty years later, Russia occupied Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years on, it is waging a full-scale war against Ukraine. The invasion has reignited discussions over whether Ukraine should develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent, though Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains the best possible security guarantee and said it has no plans for building a new nuclear arsenal. As U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war this year, Russia has outlined that a complete ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession is one of its key demands.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-nato-membership-delayed-ukraine-should-get-nuclear-weapons-instead-zelensky-says/	2025-02-05T00:52:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-05-at-9_21_22-AM-1.jpeg
8 killed, 70 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least eight civilians and injured at least 70 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 5. Russia launched two ballistic missiles, as well as 104 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones over nine oblasts, while 42 others were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, a missile strike on the town of Izium killed five people and injured 55, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Among the wounded are a 6-year-old boy and girls aged 14 and 16. The 14-year-old girl is in serious condition, while the others are in stable condition. Two more people were injured in other attacks across the region. In Donetsk Oblast, two civilians were killed in separate attacks in Pokrovsk and Druzhkivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Another four people were wounded in the region over the past day. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured eight others, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian shelling wounded a 62-year-old woman in the Polohy district, the local military administration reported. Ukraine has faced daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities continuing to report casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-killed-70-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-04T23:44:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-04_17-06-01.jpg

US aid freeze halts support for prosecuting Russian war crimes, Ukraine's energy sector, lawmaker says	The Trump administration&apos;s foreign aid freeze impacted programs supporting the prosecution of Russian war crimes and the restoration of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after attacks, Ukraine-born Democratic Congressman Eugene Vindman said on Feb. 4, Ukrinform reported. Vindman&apos;s comments come days after billionaire Elon Musk claimed he had President Donald Trump&apos;s approval to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration effectively froze almost all foreign assistance for 90 days, halting USAID-funded projects worldwide while reviewing expenditures. Speaking at the Ukraine Week event in Washington, Vindman noted that the cuts include suspending U.S. assistance in war crimes investigations and halting support for international experts assisting in the process. Programs aimed at rebuilding Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure and power grid, damaged after Russian attacks, have also been suspended, Vindman said while calling on the administration to lift the restrictions. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s primary foreign aid agency, has provided over $37 billion in support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support. The White House declared on Feb. 3 that &quot;under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; accusing USAID of misusing taxpayer funds on supposedly &quot;ridiculous&quot; projects. The listed &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; did not include anything related to Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been named interim USAID administrator, reinforcing rumors that the agency will be merged with the State Department. In the meantime, Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. assistance. Vindman, a former U.S. Army officer, gained prominence as a whistleblower in the 2019 scandal involving Trump&apos;s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Trump pressured Ukraine to launch an investigation into Joe Biden&apos;s family. Vindman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2024 &#x2014; the same day Trump won the presidency and secured his return to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-cuts-support-for-investigating-russian-war-crimes-rebuilding-ukraine-infrastructure/	2025-02-04T23:16:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157665669.jpg
Ukraine's drone strike reportedly sets fire to Russian oil depot in Krasnodar Krai	An oil facility caught fire following a Ukrainian drone strike against Krasnodar Krai in southwestern Russia overnight on Feb. 5, local authorities and Telegram channels reported. The fire at the Albashneft oil depot was extinguished at 8:11 am Moscow time, the independent Telegram channel Astra reported, publishing a video of what appears to be a burning oil tank. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. &quot;Our forces repelled a Ukrainian drone attack. In the village of Novominskaya in the Kanevsky district, drone wreckage fell on a tank containing a residue amount of petroleum products,&quot; Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratev claimed on his Telegram channel. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of the Albashneft oil depot in Novominskaya, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack on Feb. 5, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko/Telelgram)The governor confirmed that a fire broke out but reported no casualties. The extent of damage to the facility is not immediately clear. The strike against the Albashneft oil depot was also reported by Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry did not mention intercepting drones over Krasnodar Krai, reporting only two unmanned aerial vehicles downed over Kursk Oblast and two more over Belgorod Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier this week, Ukrainian drone attacks reportedly targeted energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires at the Lukoil oil refinery in Volgograd and at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oil-depot-on-fire-after-reported-ukrainian-drone-strike-in-krasnodar-krai/	2025-02-04T22:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Tank.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 844,070 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 844,070 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 5. This number includes 1,140 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,947 tanks, 20,721 armored fighting vehicles, 36,078 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,707 artillery systems, 1,269 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,053 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,102 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-844-070-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-04T22:16:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/1_GettyImages-2149875923.jpeg
US won't rule out using American troops to 'take over' Gaza Strip, Trump says	In a stunning proposal on Feb. 4, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the United States &quot;will take over&quot; the Gaza Strip, potentially with the help of American troops. &#x201C;(The United States will) own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,&#x201D; Trump said during a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump, who has repeatedly vowed to &quot;end the war&quot; in Ukraine and previously touted his record that the U.S. saw &quot;no wars&quot; during his first presidential term, said during the news conference that he will consider sending U.S. troops to the region &quot;if it&apos;s necessary.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;re going to take over that piece, that we&#x2019;re going to develop it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s comments, which come alongside Netanyahu&apos;s first visit to the United States since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, mark a rapid reversal of Trump&apos;s 2016 campaign promise to remove American troops from the Middle East following the fallout of the Iraq war. When pressed on what Trump&apos;s plans were for the Palestinians living within the region, Trump said that he would turn it into &#x201C;the Riviera of the Middle East,&#x201D; rebuilding Gaza into a jobs and tourism leading region. The president added that neighboring countries Egypt and Jordan should play a role in resettling Palestinians &#x2014; both of which have previously said they are unwilling to accept refugees. Trump&apos;s comments come as Israel and Palestine have agreed to a ceasefire, as negotiations on prisoner exchanges continue. Following his election victory in November 2024, Trump proclaimed that he was &quot;going to stop the wars.&quot; &quot;We had no wars, for four years, we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS,&quot; Trump said during his victory speech. Trump, who has a history of outlandish comments, said on Feb. 3 that he was seeking to have Ukraine supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals as a condition for aid for the war-torn country. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 3. Ukraine and its allies have been concerned about the future of U.S. aid under President Trump since he has repeatedly criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration&apos;s assistance to Kyiv. &#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-rule-out-using-american-troops-to-take-over-the-gaza-strip-trump-says/	2025-02-04T20:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154393954.jpg
Over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since start of war, Zelensky says	Ukraine has lost 45,100 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. Zelensky added that there have been a total of 390,000 cases of soldiers sustaining wounds on the battle, although the actual number of wounded soldiers is less given that some soldiers sustained multiple wounds during separate incidents. In previous statements on the total casualty count, Zelensky said that approximately half of the soldiers wounded in action later return to the battlefield. The comments from Zelensky comes as a rare admission from a Ukrainian official about the casualty count on the front line. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count in December 2024, claiming that Ukraine had lost 43,000 solider, with &quot;370,000 cases of medical assistance for the wounded.&quot; Despite the estimates, Zelensky added that it was not clear as to how many thousands of men are currently held as prisoners of war compared to those missing in action. &quot;How many of those are missing (in action) and how many of those are prisoners (of war), I do not know the precise number but we are working on it,&quot; Zelensky added. Comparing Ukraine&apos;s casualty count to that of Russia, Zelensky said the interview that approximately 350,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, with between 600,000 to 700,000 instances of Russian soldiers sustaining wounds on the battlefield. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 842,930 troops since the start of the war, a number in line with various estimates from Western intelligence sources. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. According to the U.K.&apos;s estimates, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops by May. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official in recent months let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Despite this, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports on Feb. 4 that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks, noting that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-45-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-start-of-war-zelensky-says/	2025-02-04T18:24:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251615116.jpg
Putin relaunches Soviet-era Intervision song contest amid Eurovision ban	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Feb. 3 ordering the revival of the Intervision song contest, the Soviet Union&apos;s equivalent to Eurovision. The Eurovision Song Contest banned Russia from participation in 2022 following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin&apos;s order instructs officials to host Intervision in Moscow in 2025 for the purpose of &quot;developing international cultural and humanitarian cooperation.&quot; The decree appoints Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko as chair of the organizing committee and Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko as chair of the contest&apos;s supervisory board. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed in December 2024 that over 25 countries had expressed interest in participating in Intervision, including several in Latin America. Mikhail Shvydkoi, Putin&apos;s culture envoy, previously claimed that all BRICS nations would take part. The original Intervision contest ran from 1965 until 1968, then again from 1977 to 1980. The competition served as the Soviet bloc&apos;s answer to Eurovision, which began in 1956 and is organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Russia first competed in Eurovision in 1994 and has sent many performers to the contest in the years since. Russian singer Dima Bilan is the country&apos;s only Eurovision winner, taking first place in 2008. Moscow hosted the competition the following year. Russia has been barred from Eurovision since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Later that year, Ukraine won the song contest, but was unable to host the event in 2023 due to the ongoing war. &#xA0; Ukrainian artists have won Eurovision three times: Ruslana in 2004 with &quot;Wild Dances,&quot; Jamala in 2016 with &quot;1944,&quot; and Kalush Orchestra in 2022 with &quot;Stefania.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-relaunches-soviet-era-intervision-song-contest-amid-eurovision-ban/	2025-02-04T16:46:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1233050914.jpg
Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy grid could cause nuclear accident, IAEA chief warns	Russia&apos;s continued attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid heighten the risk of a nuclear accident, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned during his visit to Kyiv on Feb. 4. &#xA0; Grossi is visiting Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian officials regarding nuclear safety in wartime before heading to Moscow to discuss the situation with Russian authorities. The visit marks his 11th mission to Kyiv since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;I&apos;m at Kyivska electrical substation&#x2014;an important part of Ukraine&apos;s power grid essential for nuclear safety,&quot; Grossi wrote on X. &quot;A nuclear accident can result from a direct attack on a plant, but also from power supply disruption.&quot; According to the IAEA, part of the purpose of the visit is to assess damage to infrastructure that plays a key role in Ukraine&apos;s nuclear safety. In a video filmed at the substation, Grossi said he was impressed with Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction efforts at the site despite the evident damage to critical infrastructure. Grossi also held meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko, and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, Russia has relentlessly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, ramping up attacks in the winter months. Recent drone and missile strikes have necessitated emergency blackouts across the country. &#xA0; These attacks and disruptions pose a risk to the safety of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants, Grossi said. &quot;Having external power supply is essential,&quot; he said. &quot;And of course, the situation is quite dire. We should not, I think, hide that fact. Ukraine relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy production, and Russia&apos;s ongoing attacks have increased the demand for nuclear energy &#x2014; while increasing the risk of nuclear disaster. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear facility, since March 2022. The plant has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&apos;s power grid due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, posing a serious hazard to nuclear safety. The IAEA has had a rotating mission at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since September 2022. The agency has also sent teams to monitor other nuclear facilities in Ukraine due to Russia&apos;s intensifying assaults on the energy system.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-grid-could-cause-nuclear-accident-iaea-chief-warns/	2025-02-04T15:27:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197092868.jpg
He works for Putin' — Zelensky slams Tucker Carlson's pro-Russian commentary	Far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson is spreading misinformation and parroting Kremlin narratives, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. In a previous interview between Carlson and Morgan, Carlson accused Zelensky of behaving like a dictator by suppressing religious freedom and the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine. &quot;That is all lies, that is all (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s narrative,&quot; Zelensky said in response. By regurgitating pro-Kremlin talking points, Carlson is &quot;misinforming&quot; the American public, Zelensky told Morgan. Zelensky also pointed out that Russia&apos;s full-scale war has hit territories in eastern Ukraine the hardest, meaning that Putin&apos;s violence has disproportionately targeted Russian speakers. &quot;Regrettably, this blogger or journalist, whatever he wants to call himself, he fully repeats the words of Putin. ... He works for Putin.&quot; Carlson, a conservative commentator and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, is among the strongest pro-Russian voices in the U.S., spreading the Kremlin&apos;s unsubstantiated claims across a variety of platforms. Last year, Carlson aired interviews with both Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, allowing them to repeat debunked narratives of Ukrainian-Russian history unchallenged. Zelensky suggested that Carlson work to better understand Ukraine and stop circulating propaganda on behalf of the Russian government. &quot;It seems to me this journalist ... He needs to stop working for Putin, to stop licking his ass, honestly.&quot; &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/he-works-for-putin-zelensky-slams-tucker-carlsons-pro-russian-commentary/	2025-02-04T13:43:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1988745179.jpg
I consider him an enemy' — Zelensky says he's ready to sit opposite Putin in peace talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to sit at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin if it is the only setup that will bring peace to Ukraine, the president told U.K. journalist Piers Morgan in an interview published Feb. 4. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Zelensky and Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war and has pledged to broker a ceasefire within the first six months of his term. Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to end the &quot;hot stage&quot; of the war and that its willingness to negotiate with Russia at all represented a compromise. &quot;We will be speaking with Putin. ... Even the conversation with Putin is a compromise,&quot; Zelensky told Morgan. When asked how he would feel sitting opposite Putin in an in-person meeting, Zelensky dismissed his personal sentiments on the matter. &quot;If that is the only setup in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely, we will go for this setup ... What does it matter, my attitude to him?&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I will not be kind to him, I consider him an enemy. And to be honest, I believe he considers me an enemy as well.&quot; Zelensky reiterated that the negotiaton process should include the Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, and Russia. He also said that Kyiv was not willing to acknowledge any occupied Ukrainian lands as Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/i-consider-him-an-enemy-zelensky-says-hes-ready-to-sit-opposite-putin-in-peace-talks/	2025-02-04T12:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/zelensky.png
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv denies reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen in Kursk Oblast for weeks	Key developments on Feb. 4: About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. However, Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;We have to wait for some time to see if there are any real changes or if this is just lower activity for a couple of days,&quot; Budanov said. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13 The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief added. According to Budanov, North Korean soldiers attack &quot;almost without any combat vehicles.&quot; Budanov also suggested that the North Korean military is so willing to advance on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery because of its loyalty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He added that their disregard for personal safety makes Ukraine&apos;s defense more challenging. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force carried out a &quot;precision strike&quot; on Feb. 3 at a Russian command post near the village of Novoivanovka in Kursk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Kyiv launched a limited incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, &#xA0;first capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. The command post, located in an abandoned building, was used to coordinate Russian troops&apos; offensive against the Ukrainian army in the Kursk sector of the front line, the statement read. The building was severely damaged, and Moscow suffered significant losses among Russian personnel, the General Staff said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier on Jan. 31, Ukrainian forces struck another command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the Russian city of Rylsk. These attacks are part of Ukraine&apos;s broader strategy to weaken Russian operational capabilities by targeting key command centers. The General Staff has emphasized that such strikes aim to reduce Russia&apos;s offensive potential. A Russian missile attack against the town of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast killed at least five people and injured at least 55 on Feb. 4, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three children were injured in the attack, including a six-year-old boy and two girls, aged 14 and 16. The 14-year-old girl is in a serious condition, while the other two children are in a condition of medium severity, according to Syniehubov. The governor initially reported four people killed &#x2013; two men and two women. A fifth victim was reported later during the day when rescue services recovered another body from the rubble. A pregnant woman was among the killed, Syniehubov reported later. According to preliminary data, Russian forces used a ballistic missile in the attack, targeting the central part of the city, Syniehubov said. An administrative building suffered a hit, while another administrative building and several residential buildings were damaged, according to the governor. Syniehubov stressed that no military facilities were located in the targeted area. Izium, a town with a pre-invasion population of 45,000, lies in the southeastern part of Kharkiv Oblast, over 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv, and around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the front line. Russian courts received 20,000 claims in 2024 seeking to declare individuals missing or dead, marking a two-and-a-half increase from previous years, independent media outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Before the full-scale war, Russian courts handled approximately 8,000 such cases annually. The surge in filings, which began in mid-2024, represents the first significant rise in missing persons cases since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The figures hint at mounting Russian losses during the full-scale invasion, which various estimates place between 600,000 and 840,000 killed and wounded. Moscow does not publish its official casualty figures. According to Mediazona, most of the claims last year were initiated by Russian military unit commanders who sought to remove missing soldiers &#x2014; presumed dead but lacking official confirmation &#x2014; from personnel rosters. This process allows units to recruit replacements. Families do not need to consent to these legal declarations, which often leaves them without financial support or clear information about their relatives&apos; fate, the outlet wrote. The exact number of missing Russian soldiers remains unknown, as courts routinely withhold applicants&apos; names and avoid publicizing rulings. In 2024, an estimated 12,000 additional cases were recorded beyond the usual peacetime figures. More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking information about missing soldiers through Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said on Jan. 3. Initially launched in September 2022 as part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline, which helps Russian soldiers surrender, the project was expanded to address requests from families searching for missing troops. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry had received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives hoping to locate missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that the DNA data was stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of Russian casualties. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, cautioned against publicizing such figures. &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly,&quot; he said. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Russia has lost 842,930 troops since launching its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Russian commanders in the Kupiansk sector are ordering their soldiers to retake positions from which they retreated under Ukrainian fire, threatening them with execution if they refuse, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces claimed on Feb. 4, citing intelligence reports. Ukrainian soldiers forced Russian troops to abandon forward positions near a settlement in the Kupiansk sector following intensive assaults, the unit said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian forces intensified their assault on Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast in September 2024, pushing toward the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several attempts to enter the town throughout December. The estimated Russian advance in the Kupiansk district, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Feb. 4, 2025. A white symbol marks the city of Kupiansk. (DeepState / OpenStreetMaps)For months, Russia has sought to establish a foothold along the eastern bank of the Oskil River, attempting to outflank Ukrainian defenses and open the way for a rear attack on Kupiansk. The front line now lies just two kilometers (1.5 miles) from the town. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia group of forces as Ukraine works to counter Russian advances in the sector. Western and Ukrainian officials have pointed to poor morale among Russian troops since the outbreak of the full-scale war. Moscow employs the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics in which its troops overwhelm Ukrainian defenders through sheer numbers despite suffering heavy losses. Reports of Russian commanders executing their soldiers have also surfaced amid some of the heaviest battles of the war, for example, during Russia&apos;s siege of the stronghold town of Avdiivka in late 2023.

Dates and participants being finalized' — Zelensky on upcoming US delegation visit	The Ukrainian government is finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a Feb. 4 press briefing in Kyiv, RBC Ukraine reported. Earlier on Feb. 2 Zelensky said that he was expecting Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, to visit Ukraine soon. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office is communicating with Trump&apos;s team, Zelensky said, including Kellogg and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. Kyiv has indicative dates for the arrival of American officials and is currently working on its arrangement, according to Zelensky. &quot;We are now finalizing the dates and the participants. We are waiting for the team and will work together,&quot; Zelensky said. Kellogg previously defined the &quot;near term&quot; end to the war as 100 days out from Trump&apos;s inauguration and said it was his personal and professional goal to help him broker a solution by that point.	https://kyivindependent.com/dates-and-participants-being-finalized-zelensky-on-upcoming-us-delegation-visit/	2025-02-04T12:00:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173926230.jpg

Trump wants Ukraine’s ‘rare earths’ — What critical materials does it actually have?	President Donald Trump came out on Feb. 3 saying he was looking to cut a deal with Ukraine by giving the war-torn country weapons and aid in return for its &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he said. It&#x2019;s unclear exactly what Trump meant by &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; Ukraine is home to 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals like titanium used in the aerospace and defense industries and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. Ukraine also possesses rare earth elements &#x2014; under which titanium and lithium do not fall &#x2014; such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Demand for these materials has jumped in recent years as the world shifts to renewable forms of energy. Trump&#x2019;s interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials may lie in China&#x2019;s current dominance over the rare earth elements market. China controls 85-90% of rare earth elements from mining to refining. With his &#x201C;America First&#x201D; agenda, the new U.S. president may be looking to fuel American competitiveness by gaining an upper hand over Beijing. The global market for critical minerals is $320 billion and could double in the next five years, according to the World Economic Forum.

(Oliver Contreras / AFP via Getty Images)For Kyiv&#x2019;s part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has positioned Ukraine&#x2019;s natural materials as part of a peace plan. Reports late last year said Zelenksy&#x2019;s team had even delayed a deal on critical materials with former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s team so it could offer it to Trump in case he won the elections. &#xA0; But the quantity and extent of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials remain uncertain. Further exploration is needed to better understand their viability. What&#x2019;s more, Russia occupies large swaths of Ukraine&#x2019;s resource-rich territory. Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials deposits are estimated to be worth $12 trillion, which could help expand the concentrated raw material market. The figure jumps up to $26 trillion when including all its natural resources like coal and natural gas. The country&#x2019;s numerous rare earth deposits are mostly spread across its central regions but are underdeveloped and the total value is unknown, according to an analysis from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). Russia also currently occupies 33% of Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth sources. The $12 trillion figure, which was touted at the Davos forum last month, should be taken with a grain of salt. Much of these reserves are unexplored and the quality and quantity of the resources are speculative.

(Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Raw critical materials across Ukraine&#x2019;s government-controlled territories amount to nearly 120 million metric tons of explored or partially explored reserves and 305 million tons of preliminary estimated resources, according to KSE. This covers 46 titanium reserves, 34 polymetallic deposits, 11 graphite deposits, and two lithium deposits. Ukraine takes the top spot in Europe for titanium reserves and has a third of Europe&#x2019;s lithium reserves as well as 20% of global graphite resources. For nonferrous metals, it takes fourth place in Europe for copper, fifth for lead, sixth for zinc, and ninth for silver, according to the Finance Ministry. The embattled country is also the fifth-largest producer of gallium, used for semiconductors and LEDs, and is an important neon gas producer, supplying 90% of neon to the U.S. chip industry. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion caused a global shortage of the gas, which was passed down to U.S. chip manufacturers. There are also deposits of materials critical for the nuclear industry. Ukraine has 1% of the global production of zirconium, as well as supplies of beryllium and uranium. According to the last government survey in 2005, the value of explored reserves of natural resources, including coal and gas, was around $150,000- 200,000 per capita, which translates to around $7-10 trillion at the time. An estimation by the American Chamber of Commerce last month put the critical mineral value at $3-26 trillion. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky meets with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (not pictured) in Rome, Italy, on Jan. 9, 2025. (Antonio Masiello/Getty Images)The issue, however, is geography. Raw materials are unevenly distributed across Ukraine and around $12 trillion has ended up in Russian-occupied territory, according to SecDev, a global digital risk and resilience firm. Russia occupies 42% of Ukraine&#x2019;s metals and 33% of its rare earths, as well as 63% of its coal deposits, 11% of its oil, and 20% of its natural gas, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. Moscow is eyeing up Ukraine&#x2019;s raw materials to fuel its overheating economy and has already stolen iron ore and coal. While it hasn&#x2019;t yet launched into extracting the critical material reserves, it is targeting infrastructure and blocking access to the materials to &#x201C;grind down&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, British intelligence said in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-ukraines-rare-earths-what-critical-materials-does-ukraine-actually-have/	2025-02-04T11:22:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1156206150.jpg
Nearly 8,000 North Korean soldiers still fighting in Kursk Oblast, Budanov says	About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4.

Ukraine open to mining rare earths in cooperation with partners, Zelensky says	Ukraine is open to mining rare earths with its partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 4 during a press briefing in Kyiv, NV reported. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. &quot;We are open to the idea that mineral resources can be developed with our partners who help us protect our land and push the enemy back with their weapons, their presence, and sanctions packages,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is absolutely fair. I talked about this back in September when we met with President Trump,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace plan first presented in 2023 includes a clause on foreign investment in Ukraine&apos;s mining industry. Zelensky also noted that if Russia controls mineral resources on the international market, there is a possibility that companies from other countries, such as Iran or North Korea, will get involved. &quot;I know that they (American businesses) are really interested in entering Ukraine, and I would like them to develop this area here,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump did not previously specify what kind of rare earths the U.S. wants to acquire but said that Kyiv was ready to cooperate. Ukraine and its allies have been concerned about the future of U.S. aid under President Trump since he has repeatedly criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration&apos;s assistance to Kyiv. The U.S. is the largest backer of Ukraine&apos;s defense, having provided over $91 billion in aid, including over $62 billion worth of military assistance, since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-mine-rare-earths-in-cooperation-with-partners-zelensky-says/	2025-02-04T10:52:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1523446196.jpg
Explainer: Ukraine’s EuroMaidan was not a coup, despite Russian disinfo pushed by Musk	More than a decade after Ukraine&#x2019;s pro-democracy EuroMaidan Revolution, the false &#x2014; but persistent &#x2014; claim that the movement was a Western-backed &quot;coup&quot; refuses to die. Elon Musk on Feb. 2 boosted to his more than 215 million followers a post on X which parroted Russian disinformation, claiming without evidence that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had once been involved in toppling the Ukrainian government. Musk, who is leading an initiative for President Donald Trump to slash government spending, has repeatedly discredited the agency in recent days and is pushing for its shutdown. Research over the years has revealed that Russian propagandists have worked hard to spread the false narrative of a &#x201C;coup&#x201D; in Ukraine since 2014. With Musk taking a prominent position in the U.S. government, they now appear to have a sympathetic ear in the halls of American power. What Russian disinformation and its promotors ignore is clear evidence that the Euromaidan Revolution was organized spontaneously by Ukrainians in a grassroots fashion. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country and walks of life came together to spend three months in freezing temperatures to protest the undemocratic actions of their president and government. Rather than being violently or illegally forced out, as the term coup used by Musk and propagandists would suggest, Ukraine&#x2019;s then-president Viktor Yanukovych voluntarily fled the country to Russia after ordering his police forces to open fire on and kill civilian protestors. The subsequent transfer of power was carried out democratically through free and fair elections. Ukrainian riot police on Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 19, 2014. (Oleksii Furman/Getty Images)A protester stands behind barricades during clashes with police in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 20, 2014. (Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images)The Russian government also has a clear incentive to invalidate a pivotal moment in Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic history as it represents a shift away from Russian influence. Here&#x2019;s what actually happened, and how the Kremlin has worked to obfuscate the truth. Before the EuroMaidan protests began on Nov. 21, 2013, the Ukrainian government was preparing to sign an agreement that would integrate Ukraine more closely with the EU. Yanukovych had run on a platform of improving relations with the union when he was elected in 2010. Caving to economic pressure from Russia, Yanukovych suddenly abandoned these plans in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Hundreds of peaceful protesters gathered in Kyiv&#x2019;s Independence Square &#x2014; known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Ukrainian &#x2014; in response to Yanukovych&#x2019;s decision. An initial violent crackdown by Ukraine&#x2019;s riot police on Nov. 30, 2013, only fueled the protesters, who swelled in number to hundreds of thousands over the ensuing weeks. Protests spread to oblasts across the country, particularly among students and young people, and many made their way to Kyiv to join the protests happening in the country&#x2019;s capital.

(Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)As the protests continued, their demands expanded beyond European integration, and became a stand against corruption, injustice, and human rights violations, including the violent efforts by Ukrainian police to repress peaceful protests. In January 2014, to shut down the protests, Yanukovych and the parliament implemented laws restricting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, which were deemed &#x201C;dictatorship laws&#x201D; in much of Ukraine and widely denounced around the world as anti-democratic. The protests lasted until that February, when Yanukovych ordered snipers of the Berkut special forces to open fire on protesters, killing over 100 people who are remembered as the &#x201C;Heavenly Hundred.&#x201D; Yanukovych fled to Russia in the immediate aftermath, and a parliament majority democratically voted to remove Yanukovych from office, calling for an early election that international observers declared free and fair. After Yanukovych left, a raid on his home revealed a staggering level of corruption. Ukrainian then-President Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 17, 2010. (Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images)A photographer who was on the Maidan with protesters recalled to the Kyiv Independent on the tenth anniversary of the protests being injured by a rubber bullet while photographing snipers shooting at unarmed protesters. &quot;I understood that I was defending my rights, that I was standing for what they wanted to take away from me,&#x201D; he said. Russia seized on the events almost immediately, attempting to paint the EuroMaidan protests as a coup backed by the U.S. In Dec. 2013, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said in a speech at a conference organized by the non-governmental organization U.S.-Ukraine Foundation that the U.S. had invested over $5 billion in Ukraine since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 to &quot;ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.&quot; She praised the EuroMaidan movement in the same speech. Those comments &#x2014; and the U.S.&#x2019;s role in coups in other countries in the past &#x2014; have been used by propagandists to claim that Washington funded the EuroMaidan protests. Despite attempts to portray it otherwise, the $5 billion spent in Ukraine was unrelated to the protests. The funds went to supporting fair elections, funding anti-corruption efforts, and developing the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure over the years.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)Nuland later clarified in April 2014: &#x201C;We certainly didn&#x2019;t spend any money supporting the Maidan. That was a spontaneous movement, which is a far cry from what we are concerned Russia is up to now in eastern Ukraine.&#x201D; At the time of her speech, Russia had already illegally invaded and annexed Crimea and was sending troops to eastern Ukraine. Around the same time, a hacked phone call between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt was posted on YouTube. In the recording, Nuland and Pyatt discuss goals for Ukraine&#x2019;s political future and their efforts to steer Ukrainian opposition political figures toward various positions in a new post-revolution government. While the leak was embarrassing for the Americans and revealed the U.S. was seeking more involvement in Ukraine&#x2019;s political future than it publicly let on, the contents of the call do not support Russian claims that the U.S. was involved in backing a coup. Timothy Snyder, a professor of history at Yale University specializing in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, said a few weeks after the leak: &#x201C;What that telephone conversation showed was that the Americans were, A, not up to date about what was happening in Ukraine and, B, unable to influence events happening in Ukraine.&#x201D; Many of the scenarios the Americans were hoping for in the call did not end up happening, he noted. &#x201C;Imagine just how much evidence the Russians have of what the U.S. was doing in Ukraine, given that they had access to that telephone call. That was the best bit they could come up with,&#x201D; Snyder also said at the time in reference to the leak.

(Etienne De Malglaive/Getty Images)The U.S. blamed Russia for the hack, noting that a Russian official was the first to spot and point it out online, and a transcript posted with the video was in Russian. Nuland and Pyatt appeared once again in Russian propaganda narratives after the two were photographed offering food to the protesters in Kyiv. The gesture was intended as a show of support and solidarity for democracy after the anti-democratic violent crackdown by Ukrainian authorities. Russian commenters online used it to disparage protestors as having &#x201C;sold out&#x201D; to Washington. Eleven years after the protests, claims that EuroMaidan was a coup continue to persist. His Feb. 2 social media post isn&apos;t the first time Musk has pushed these narratives. In 2023, he prompted pushback from Ukrainian authorities after he posted online in reference to Ukraine that there was &#x201C;no question that there was indeed a coup.&quot; Advisor to Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak responded by telling him to read less Russian media, saying: &#x201C;Enslaved societies take to the streets to rid themselves of repressive states. This is the basis of freedom, Elon Musk. &quot;There have never been coups in Ukraine, but there have always been free people.&#x201D; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump&apos;s nominee for health secretary, also repeated the false claim that the U.S. spent $5 billion on a coup in Ukraine in an interview with far-right American political commentator Tucker Carlson in 2023.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)It&#x2019;s no accident these propaganda statements have taken root. Russia has carried out a coordinated campaign for years to amplify these claims. Detector Media found that official Russian channels on social media have been claiming EuroMaidan was a coup using the propaganda tactic of &#x201C;relentless repetition,&#x201D; disseminating these messages on many accounts representing a variety of organizations in different countries. These comments are pushed in various languages to reach broad audiences. These comments have also been echoed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials over the years, including just two months ago by Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during an interview hosted by Carlson.	https://kyivindependent.com/explainer-ukraines-euromaidan-was-not-a-coup-despite-russian-disinfo-pushed-by-musk/	2025-02-04T10:20:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-470193947.jpg
Italy allocates over $2 million to strengthen Ukraine's energy system	Italy has signed an agreement with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to launch a 2 million euro ($2.07 million) project to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy system, the Italian Embassy in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Russia has consistently attacked Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since 2022, resulting in nationwide power outages and causing an energy deficit. The project, funded by the Italian government, aims to make Ukraine&apos;s energy system &quot;more resilient and decentralized&quot; in accordance with the &quot;Build Back Better&quot; principle. The initiative provides for a detailed analysis of opportunities for integrating renewable energy sources into Ukraine&apos;s energy system, said Italian Ambassador to Ukraine Carlo Formosa, who participated in the signing of the agreement with the U.N. &quot;Advanced technological tools will be explored to improve energy efficiency and reduce consumption in order to create a model for more sustainable energy planning for cities,&quot; he said. The project includes training and technology transfer involving Italian and Ukrainian experts to enhance local expertise in sustainable energy management, the statement read. The program will also support the Ukrainian government in developing a long-term policy for the energy transition and attracting investment in the renewable energy sector, according to Formosa. There were two large-scale Russian attacks on energy infrastructure over the past month, as well as smaller attacks, but due to the warm weather, the Ukrainian energy grid was able to operate without scheduled blackouts.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-allocates-over-2-million-to-strengthen-ukraines-energy-system/	2025-02-04T10:13:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-04-at-3_30_41-PM.png
Ukraine won't hold elections until Russia's war is over, Ukraine's envoy to US says	Ukraine won&apos;t hold elections until Russia&apos;s war is over, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told Suspilne in an interview published on Feb. 4. Markarova&apos;s statement comes after Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, called for parliamentary and presidential elections in Ukraine by the end of the year, especially if Kyiv reaches a ceasefire deal with Moscow. Elections are banned from being held in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in effect since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The U.S. hasn&apos;t yet discussed with Ukraine the necessity of holding elections by the end of 2025, according to Markarova. &quot;Ukraine and America are free countries. Everyone can speak their mind. If this issue is addressed, we are certainly ready for this discussion, as we have done before. We will be very happy if elections are held in Ukraine because it will mean that we have won this war,&quot; Markarova said. Kellogg previously argued that most democratic nations hold elections during wartime and that doing so would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. Under martial law, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned in Ukraine. If martial law had not been imposed, a presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. To be able to hold elections during martial law, Ukraine would need to make changes to the legislature, as well as set up infrastructure for Ukrainian refugees abroad, military personnel on duty, and Ukrainians living in areas close to the war zone to be able to vote. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russian attacks have destroyed some of Ukraine&apos;s electoral infrastructure. Ukraine does not currently have the appropriate infrastructure or mechanism to organize elections that guarantee all citizens&apos; electoral and political rights, according to Ukrainian Civili Network Opora. Earlier on Jan. 2, Zelensky suggested that if the &quot;hot phase of the war is over,&quot; the parliament could lift martial law and set a date for elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-hold-elections-until-russias-war-is-over-ukraines-envoy-to-us-says/	2025-02-04T08:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/markarova.jpg
Europe must act on Russian LNG before Trump makes it impossible	Europe&#x2019;s window to ban Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) is closing faster than we think. As a second Trump administration takes shape, Europe&apos;s opportunity to impose new, meaningful measures on Russian fossil fuels is rapidly diminishing. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s plan to end the war allegedly includes offering sanctions relief in exchange for peace. Whether true or not, Europe will soon lose its ability to act independently on energy sanctions as they become bargaining chips in a twisted geopolitical game of poker. After nearly three years of full-scale war, Western sanctions on Russia are at a turning point. Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s newly appointed envoy to Ukraine, has reportedly crafted a strategy that includes lifting certain sanctions as part of a negotiation process. This approach would undermine the leverage that Western nations &#x2014; especially the European Union &#x2014; have painstakingly built over the past three years. But whether Europe or Ukraine agrees with this strategy is irrelevant. This is Trump. We must plan for the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. Regardless of Trump&#x2019;s recent rhetoric and threats, Western sanctions on Russia are likely at &#x2014; or near &#x2014; their peak. Russia is currently subject to some 20,000 Western restrictions, but only a small subset &#x2014; mainly financial and energy sanctions &#x2014; carry significant weight. Within this landscape, one glaring issue remains: Russian LNG imports to Europe. These imports not only finance the Kremlin&#x2019;s war in Ukraine but also fund Russia&#x2019;s ongoing sabotage, attacks, and assassinations on European soil. Despite the EU&#x2019;s stated goal of reducing reliance on Russian energy, European purchases of Russian LNG have surged in recent months, undermining Europe&#x2019;s own industrial security. Every shipment of Russian LNG that enters European ports funnels revenue into the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. The danger of inaction is clear. If reports of a 100-day or six-month negotiation window are accurate, Europe may soon lose the ability to ban Russian LNG altogether. Once negotiations begin, a Trump administration is unlikely to support new, hard-hitting measures that could complicate talks. Imagine a scenario in which world leaders finally begin serious peace talks in the coming months. Would the West impose a new ban on Russian LNG in that context? Clearly not. The time to act is now &#x2014; before negotiations begin &#x2014; while Europe still holds the cards. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump (R) arrive for a group photo at the G20 Osaka summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28, 2019. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)Some may argue that banning Russian LNG now is futile if it could later be reversed in a peace deal. This view overlooks two key points. First, implementing a ban now would significantly strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position. Second, banning Russian LNG would accelerate energy diversification across Europe, establishing new trade patterns that would be difficult &#x2014; and unwise &#x2014; to undo, even in the event of a future agreement. The Trump administration is likely to pressure Europe to adopt its own sanctions policy, even at the expense of European interests. The U.S. has a history of urging the EU to dilute its measures, as seen with the oil price cap, which replaced the EU&#x2019;s original plan for a full ban on Russian oil trade. By taking decisive action now, Europe can assert its autonomy and safeguard its long-term financial and strategic interests. By banning Russian LNG imports &#x2014; potentially as part of its upcoming 16th sanctions package &#x2014; the EU would send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow. To ensure a smooth transition, Ukrainian civil society encourages the European Commission to establish a fund to support member states and industries in moving away from gas and to strengthen energy partnerships with Ukraine, particularly in renewable energy development and grid interconnection. The EU has taken a measured, long-term approach to phasing out Russian fossil fuels, carefully securing consensus and imposing bans incrementally. But the return of chaos agent Donald Trump forces the European Commission to make a critical decision. It can continue enabling Russia&#x2019;s war machine through LNG imports &#x2014; or it can take bold action to sever this toxic lifeline once and for all.

US producers, Saudi Arabia resist Trump's push for increased oil production, WSJ reports	American oil producers and Saudi Arabia are pushing back against U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s call to ramp up oil production, signaling reluctance to align with his strategy to lower global energy prices, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Feb. 3. Trump has repeatedly called for lowering oil prices by increasing production, arguing that undercutting Russia&apos;s oil revenue would force Moscow to end its war against Ukraine. While major oil companies were among Trump&apos;s top campaign donors, their priority is regulatory relief and long-term market stability rather than an immediate production surge, sources told the WSJ. U.S. shale producers have reportedly informed the White House that they do not plan to expand drilling, despite Trump&apos;s rhetoric about boosting output. Saudi Arabia has also conveyed its reluctance to increase production. According to the WSJ, Riyadh has privately informed former U.S. officials that it does not intend to ramp up output, a position that has been passed on to the current administration. Speaking via video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower oil prices, claiming it would bring an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. OPEC, which includes 12 member states, including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, controls about 30% of the global oil supply and can significantly influence prices through production adjustments. Trump&apos;s energy policy aligns with broader efforts to increase pressure on Russia&apos;s economy. Keith Kellogg, the incoming U.S. peace envoy, told Fox News on Jan. 24 that stricter measures targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry could weaken the Kremlin&apos;s financial standing and force it into negotiations. Trump has claimed that his team has already held &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with Russian officials about the war in Ukraine and suggested that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take &quot;significant steps&quot; toward ending the conflict. Putin said on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with Trump, whom he described as having a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Moscow. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that Putin is increasingly concerned about Russia&apos;s economy, citing five undisclosed sources. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Trump could fulfill his promise to end the war, but only if Ukraine is included in negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-for-lower-oil-prices-to-end-ukraine-war-us-producers-reject-expansion-wsj-reports/	2025-02-04T05:50:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182697515.jpg
Emergency power shutdowns introduced in 8 oblasts due to Russian attacks	Emergency energy power shutdowns were introduced in eight Ukrainian oblasts due to higher consumption and Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy system, Ukrenergo, Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, reported on Feb. 4. The news comes as Ukraine&apos;s power grid continues to recover from past Russian missile and drone strikes, with restoration work continuing at power facilities. The most recent Russian attacks inflicted damage to electricity generation and transmission facilities, leading to power cutoffs, Ukrenergo wrote. Electricity consumption is also growing as temperatures in Ukraine drop below zero. The emergency shutdowns were introduced in the Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, and Kirovohrad oblasts, as well as partially in the Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy oblasts, Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The grid operator Ukrenergo asked Ukrainians to reduce electricity consumption between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to prevent electricity shortages. Scheduled blackouts were common across Ukraine when Russia launched mass attacks on the country&apos;s energy system in the fall and winter of 2022-2023 and in the spring-summer period of 2024. These attacks also led to heat, water, and mobile network disruptions throughout Ukraine. This winter was expected to be one of the war&#x2019;s toughest, with blackouts potentially lasting up to 20 hours a day. For now, Ukraine has managed to avoid predicted winter blackouts due to warm weather and Ukraine&apos;s improved ability to protect and quickly repair its energy infrastructure despite continued Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/emergency-power-shutdowns-introduced-in-8-oblasts-due-to-russian-attacks/	2025-02-04T05:45:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620473.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank reports first loss in 9 years after Russian court ruling, Bloomberg reports	Raiffeisen Bank International reported its first quarterly net loss in nine years after allocating $867 million for an adverse court ruling in Russia, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 4. Raiffeisen is the largest Western bank still operating in Russia. While it initially hesitated to withdraw from the Russian market, the bank announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; scale down its business in the country. The Austrian lender reported a net loss of 926 million euros ($955 million) in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to provisions in its Russian subsidiary. &quot;The business reduction in Russia is making good progress,&quot; CEO Johann Strobl reportedly said. Russian court rulings have complicated the bank&apos;s withdrawal. In September 2024, a court issued a preliminary decision blocking the transfer of Raiffeisen&apos;s shares, which the company said would &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in its exit. Russian government restrictions also prevent Raiffeisen from transferring its Russian earnings to its parent company in Austria. As a result, the bank has accumulated 4.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in excess capital within Russia, Bloomberg reported. Raiffeisen&apos;s Russian branch earned over $1 billion in the first three quarters of 2023 &#x2014; about 50% of the group&apos;s total profits &#x2014; and paid 277 million euros ($284 million) in taxes to Russia over the same period. Bloomberg previously reported on Feb. 3 that Raiffeisen Bank&apos;s Russian subsidiary cooperates with companies supplying the Russian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-reports-first-quarterly-loss-in-nine-years-after-russian-court-ruling-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-04T05:28:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1250736178.jpg
Less than half of Poles support continued military aid to Ukraine, survey shows	The number of Poles backing continued military assistance to Kyiv dropped from 54% to 49% over the course of 2024, according to a survey commissioned by the Mieroszewski Center in Poland and published on Feb. 4. While in February 2024, 36% of respondents said &quot;rather yes&quot; and 18% &quot;definitely yes&quot; to a question of continued military support, the numbers went to 33% and 16% by December, respectively, according to the research carried out by the ARC Rynek i Opinia group. In turn, 11% said &quot;no&quot; and 15% leaned toward &quot;no&quot; in February 2024. These numbers went up to 16% and 19% in December. Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, providing extensive military, humanitarian, and political assistance. The Polish-Ukrainian relations have been nevertheless strained in the past few years by resurgent historical grievances and trade disputes. Other statistics in the survey also show a mild deterioration of Polish-Ukrainian relations. The number of Poles in favor of continued assistance to Ukrainian refugees went from 42% to 40%, while those in opposition increased in numbers from 33% to 37%. According to an earlier survey from the start of the full-scale war, 94% of Poles supported aiding Ukrainian refugees in March 2022. Almost 1 million Ukrainian refugees are registered in Poland as of January 2025, according to U.N. data, making it second only to Germany in terms of numbers. The survey also shows that the number of Poles with negative attitudes toward Ukrainians went from 27% to 30%, while those with positive attitudes dropped by two percentage points to 23%. These figures are largely in line with earlier surveys in Poland and other countries supporting Ukraine, which also show a steady decrease in support for the Ukrainian military effort and refugees. Several Western leaders have warned against the growing fatigue as the full-scale war nears its third anniversary and urged steady resolve in supporting Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/less-than-half-of-poles-support-continued-military-aid-to-ukraine-survey-shows/	2025-02-04T05:16:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1742556453.jpg
Ukraine’s robotic army is bringing the fight to Russia	Ukraine has become a war lab for the future since the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Driven by necessity, it has had no choice but to rely on rapid innovations to fight back. As a result, Ukraine is at the forefront of military technology, leveraging robotics and automation to redefine modern warfare and serve as a testing ground for future combat technologies. As it continues to develop and deploy cutting-edge unmanned systems, the world is closely watching how these advancements shape the battlefield. Given that Ukraine is already using AI-enabled drones, the deployment of autonomous ground robots may become a reality sooner than expected. Now, Ukraine is building a robotic army, aiming to have more than 200 uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) in operation by the end of the year. As it continues deploying these robots, it is gathering valuable data and insights that will shape the development of future autonomous systems. This experience positions Ukraine to train AI models and lead the way in deploying next-generation autonomous robots when the time comes. In a November 2023 interview with The Economist, former Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi described the war as &quot;positional,&quot; warning that the prolonged conflict threatens not only Ukraine&apos;s military but the survival of the state itself. He said breaking the deadlock would require a major technological leap. With dwindling Western arms supplies and a resource-rich adversary, Ukraine is turning to technology to level the playing field. What started with drone warfare has expanded to advanced robotic systems, marking a new chapter in Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against a much larger invader. In December 2024, Ukrainian forces reached a milestone by launching their first successful attack on Russian positions using only ground and FPV drones &#x2014; demonstrating the growing sophistication of Ukraine&#x2019;s unmanned warfare. According to Sgt. Volodymyr Dehtiarov of the Khartiia Brigade, dozens of robotic and unmanned systems, including machine-gun-equipped ground drones and kamikaze FPV drones, were deployed near Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) commented on the attack, writing, &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilize technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains.&quot; While Russian casualties have surpassed 750,000, Ukraine continues to innovate with systems like the Honey Badger unmanned ground vehicle &#x2014; an explosive-laden robot designed to infiltrate and neutralize armored targets. Recognizing the potential of such advancements, Ukrainian authorities established the BRAVE1 defense innovation initiative in spring 2023 to streamline cooperation between the military, state institutions, private sector developers, and investors, fostering a more efficient and coordinated approach to defense technology. Ukraine previously used a ground robot to help assault a Russian trench in Kursk Oblast in September 2024. With a significant manpower disparity along the nearly 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line, Ukraine has no choice but to maximize its technological capabilities, deploying an array of unmanned systems to support its forces. One Ukrainian official noted that &quot;Ukraine has made the most of turning industrial disadvantage into a furnace of innovation.&quot; Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian military&apos;s 121st Brigade load a Vampire drone with an anti-tank mine to target Russian positions in Krasnohorivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on July 22, 2024.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Technological advancements in the war have moved quickly, but a key challenge is organizing research, development, testing, and the integration of various systems across all units. In February 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky created the National Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), appointing Col. Vadym Sukharevskyi as commander in June 2024. Ukrainian startups are playing a crucial role in advancing battlefield technology, with around 250 companies contributing to the war effort. One such startup developed an unmanned ground vehicle called the Odyssey in just four days in a shed, costing only 10% of what an imported model would. &quot;We are fighting a huge country with no resource limits. We know we cannot afford to lose many lives,&quot; said Denysenko, head of the defense startup UkrPrototyp. The BRAVE1 initiative has already successfully tested more than 50 ground-based systems. UNITED24, the fund launched by Zelensky, also began raising money for a ground-based robotic platform, noting, &quot;These robots aim to save lives on the battlefield and among civilians by serving as logistical support, evacuators, mine layers, and deminers, as well as combatants.&quot; Warfare is entering an era where victory may no longer depend on manpower but on the ability to sustain and replenish robotic assets. Future conflicts may be fought until one side can no longer afford to replace its machines &#x2014; an unsettling yet increasingly plausible scenario in modern warfare. This shift is evident in how drones are used on the battlefield. Ukrainian drone operators, stationed miles behind the front lines, are orchestrating strikes with precision from a distance &#x2014; highlighting the radical transformation of 21st-century warfare. Just as British redcoats once used volley fire to dominate spear-wielding adversaries in the 18th century, today&apos;s conflicts are seeing a similar technological disparity, where unmanned systems grant those with superior technology a decisive advantage. However, robots alone cannot solve Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. Still, Ukraine is actively working to develop a force of battlefield robots to minimize human involvement and save lives. As one Ukrainian official explained, &quot;We count people, and we want our people to be as far from the front line as we can.&quot; Ukraine plans to deploy tens of thousands of uncrewed robotic ground vehicles this year to transport supplies, evacuate wounded soldiers, and support infantry in trench warfare, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov. These buggy-like vehicles, already in use along the front and in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, help reduce risks to troops under heavy Russian shelling and drone attacks. Fedorov, who has played a key role in overseeing Ukraine&#x2019;s drone procurement, has been a leading force in fostering private-public innovation in military technology throughout the war. Ground-based robots are poised to play an increasingly critical role in Ukraine&apos;s war effort, excelling at tasks like loitering &#x2014; remaining in high-risk areas for extended periods, something human soldiers struggle to do safely. These robotic systems are used for reconnaissance, persistent surveillance, and logistics, such as delivering supplies and evacuating wounded soldiers under fire. Unlike humans, robots can operate tirelessly and withstand prolonged exposure to dangerous environments, providing continuous battlefield support. Retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley has projected that robotic systems could make up a third of the U.S. military within the next decade, underscoring the broader implications of Ukraine&#x2019;s technological progress. Despite these groundbreaking advancements, Ukraine&apos;s success still depends on sustained Western support to strengthen its battlefield position ahead of potential peace negotiations. Its resourcefulness and ability to rapidly develop and deploy cutting-edge unmanned systems have positioned Ukraine as a potential global leader in modern warfare technology. If Ukraine emerges from this war as a free and sovereign state, it is well-positioned to become a powerhouse in developing next-generation combat systems that could shape military doctrine for years to come.

Yanukovych's son made billions selling coal from occupied Ukrainian territories, media reports	Oleksandr Yanukovych, the son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, has made billions selling coal from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories to Turkey, independent investigative outlet Important Stories reported on Feb. 4. Viktor Yanukovych was Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin president from 2010 to 2014 before fleeing to Russia with his family in the wake of the EuroMaidan Revolution. In October 2024, reports emerged that Yanukovych Jr. had been granted Russian citizenship. The company behind the coal exports, Energoresurs, is registered in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, and has exported nearly half a million tons of coal abroad between 2023 and 2024. According to the investigation, the firm sources coal from suppliers in occupied Donbas and transports it to Turkey by rail and sea. Journalists linked Energoresurs to Yanukovych Jr. through his coal holdings and mining enterprises. The company also received a loan from the Cypriot firm SL Holdings Limited, allegedly controlled by individuals close to the ex-president&apos;s son. The coal is reportedly sold to an offshore company, Energy Union, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Energoresurs sells the coal at a significantly low price &#x2014; an average of $60 per ton in 2024 &#x2014; allowing the company to minimize export duties before reselling it at a higher price on international markets. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Energoresurs exported coal to Bulgaria, Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Romania. Since then, almost all coal shipments have been redirected to Turkey. Between 2021 and 2023, the company reportedly generated $350,000 in revenue, though at a &quot;modest transfer price,&quot; according to the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/yanukovychs-son-made-billions-selling-coal-from-occupied-ukraine-to-turkey-report-says/	2025-02-04T04:33:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-470932149.jpg
Illegal maneuver' — Democratic lawmakers oppose merging USAID under State Department	Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Feb. 3 protested the merging of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the State Department, warning that the decision threatens global aid programs, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting administrator of USAID, according to a statement published on Feb. 3. The announcement came shortly after Trump&apos;s ally Elon Musk claimed that he had the president&apos;s support in shutting down the agency. Members of Congress gathered outside the USAID headquarters in Washington, condemning what they called an &quot;illegal maneuver&quot; by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk, who Trump has tasked with reducing the size of the federal government. The lawmakers also protested reports that USAID employees had been ordered not to report to work and were locked out of government email and accounts. The Congress members accused Musk of interfering in U.S. foreign aid programs while his companies, including SpaceX, continue to receive Pentagon contracts. &quot;Elon Musk is a terrible president,&quot; Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and the running mate of the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, posted on X, alluding to what some see as the billionaire&apos;s oversized influence in the new administration. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s primary foreign aid agency, funds programs in global health, clean water access, energy security, and civil society. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The administration&apos;s move has effectively frozen all foreign assistance for at least 90 days, halting USAID-funded projects worldwide while the administration carries out a review. On Feb. 3, the White House announced, &quot;Under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; criticizing USAID for misusing taxpayer money on supposedly &quot;ridiculous&quot; projects. The &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; list included nothing related to Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s humanitarian and information policy parliamentary committee has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. funding.	https://kyivindependent.com/illegal-maneuver-democratic-lawmakers-oppose-trumps-plan-to-merge-usaid-into-state-department/	2025-02-04T03:44:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197460670.jpg
EU allocates $258 million in energy support for Moldova, $62 million for Transnistria	The European Commission and Moldova signed a two-year strategy for energy independence and resilience, allocating 250 million euros ($258 million) to Chisinau in 2025, the commission said on Feb. 4. In addition to this overall support, 60 million euros ($62 million) are made available &#x2014; under conditions &#x2014; to Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region of Moldova facing energy shortages since Russia&apos;s Gazprom cut off gas supplies. The Russian energy giant halted the gas flow to Moldova in January, just as Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas through its territory. Gazprom claimed its decision was based on an alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues. The EU&apos;s support for Moldova, 100 million euros ($103 million) of which will be provided by mid-April, aims at &quot;decoupling Moldova from the insecurities of Russian energy supply and fully integrating it in the EU energy market,&quot; the commission&apos;s statement read. Moldova, currently leading talks on EU accession, has already pivoted toward European gas supplies but receives electricity from the Transnistria Kuciurgan power plant, which, in turn, is reliant on Russian gas. The EU&apos;s offer to Transnistria is subject to conditions that the local authorities take steps on &quot;fundamental freedoms and human rights&quot; and that the aid will not involve any &quot;energy intensive activities.&quot; As the first step of the strategy, the EU has already provided 30 million euros ($31 million) to Moldova that were announced on Jan. 27. The final step of the plan will entail investments in Moldova&apos;s energy resilience and independence, which will be included in the EU&apos;s Growth Plan for Moldova and implemented by 2026.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-allocates-258-million-in-energy-support-for-moldova-62-million-earmarked-for-transnistria/	2025-02-04T03:18:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1258308410.jpg
Russia records 20,000 claims to declare people dead or missing last year, marking 2.5-fold surge, media reports	Russian courts received 20,000 claims in 2024 seeking to declare individuals missing or dead, marking a two-and-a-half increase from previous years, independent media outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Before the full-scale war, Russian courts handled approximately 8,000 such cases annually. The surge in filings, which began in mid-2024, represents the first significant rise in missing persons cases since Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The figures hint at mounting Russian losses during the full-scale invasion, which various estimates place between 600,000 and 840,000 killed and wounded. Moscow does not publish its official casualty figures. According to Mediazona, most of the claims last year were initiated by Russian military unit commanders who sought to remove missing soldiers &#x2014; presumed dead but lacking official confirmation &#x2014; from personnel rosters. This process allows units to recruit replacements. Families do not need to consent to these legal declarations, which often leaves them without financial support or clear information about their relatives&apos; fate, the outlet wrote. The exact number of missing Russian soldiers remains unknown, as courts routinely withhold applicants&apos; names and avoid publicizing rulings. In 2024, an estimated 12,000 additional cases were recorded beyond the usual peacetime figures. More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking information about missing soldiers through Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said on Jan. 3. Initially launched in September 2022 as part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline, which helps Russian soldiers surrender, the project was expanded to address requests from families searching for missing troops. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry had received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives hoping to locate missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that the DNA data was stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of Russian casualties. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, cautioned against publicizing such figures. &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly,&quot; he said. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Russia has lost 842,930 troops since launching its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-records-20000-missing-or-dead-claims/	2025-02-04T02:26:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1242120665.jpg
4 killed, 20 injured in Russian missile strike on Izium in Kharkiv Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile attack against the town of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 4 killed at least four people and injured 20, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. At least five of the injured have been hospitalized. According to preliminary data, Russian forces used a ballistic missile in the attack, targeting the central part of the city, Syniehubov said. The full extent of damage and casualties is being determined. Izium, a town with a pre-invasion population of 45,000, lies in the southeastern part of Kharkiv Oblast, over 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv, and around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the front line. Kharkiv Oblast in Ukraine&apos;s northeast is a regular target of Russian missile and drone attacks from across the border or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-izium/	2025-02-04T02:06:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1746314205.jpeg
What to expect from Ukraine’s defense innovation in 2025	Despite the uncertainty surrounding a potential resolution to the war, Ukrainians know one thing for sure: we must ramp up our defense capabilities to effectively defend against current and future Russian aggression. This requires the rapid development of asymmetrical solutions to counter Russia&apos;s advantages in personnel, material, and financial resources. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine underscored the importance of technological innovation in national defense. In fact, cutting-edge technology and ingenuity have been key to Ukraine&apos;s ability to resist and achieve victories against Russia. For example, the mass deployment of FPV drones was crucial in holding off Russian offenses during late 2023 and early 2024, when Ukraine faced severe ammunition shortages. In 2024, the Ukrainian military received more than 1 million drones &#x2014; what began as a largely volunteer initiative at the start of the war was significantly bolstered by the Ukrainian state. Ukraine continues to accelerate its efforts, with the government&apos;s Brave1 platform serving as a key birthplace for innovations. Brave1 is currently supporting over 1,500 Ukrainian tech companies with a total of $30 million in grants, in addition to providing comprehensive logistical, technical, and informational support. By engaging both domestic and foreign investors, we achieved an eightfold increase in investment in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching $40 million. These efforts have led to the development of several crucial technologies, such as interceptor drones capable of destroying Russian reconnaissance drones like the Orlan and Zala, significantly hindering Russia&apos;s precision strike capabilities. While these innovations are rapidly driven by the evolving battlefield situation, we can identify key strategic priorities for Ukraine in 2025 based on our experience as a leading government platform for accelerating defense tech innovation. Artificial intelligence is already widely used on the battlefield in Ukraine, with Brave1 supporting over 200 AI-driven innovations. Its applications range from analyzing photo and video data gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the battlefield through military intelligence systems like Griselda and Delta to AI-powered drones capable of hitting targets even under electronic warfare (EW) interference. The next step is moving beyond the &quot;one drone, one operator&quot; model to &quot;drone swarms&quot; &#x2014; autonomous, intelligent networks of multiple drones controlled by a single operator. &quot;Shahed&quot; suicide drones, originally an Iranian product, are now mass-produced and deployed by Russia daily, primarily targeting civilian infrastructure as a form of terrorist attack. Given their prevalence and devastating impact on the Ukrainian civilian population, Ukrainian innovators are likely to focus efforts on countering this threat. While aerial drones often dominate discussions, land-based technologies are also a priority for Brave1, with over 300 solutions examined and more than 40 codified according to NATO standards. These land drones can compensate for Ukraine&apos;s personnel shortages by performing tasks currently carried out by soldiers on the ground, including reconnaissance, supporting defensive and offensive operations, cargo delivery, casualty evacuation, and mine clearing/laying. Crucially, these technologies protect Ukrainian lives. We expect to see further advancements in both the number and functionality of land-based drones in 2025. A &quot;Zmii&quot; unmanned demining vehicle is showcased as part of a joint UNDP and Ukrainian Economy Ministry initiative at an unidentified location in May 2024. (UNDP in Ukraine)Domestic missile programIn 2024, Ukraine managed to bring the war to Russian territory, not only through the Kursk operation but also through a number of successful long-range drone strikes deep into Russian territory, targeting the aggressor&apos;s war infrastructure. In 2025, we expect more such strikes as Ukraine&apos;s domestic missile program rapidly develops. This area is particularly important as Ukraine has faced hesitation from partners in providing long-range weapons in the past. Electronic warfare (EW) is rapidly becoming a key defense tech area as the war increasingly revolves around drone warfare, with both Russian occupiers and Ukrainian defenders using drones daily. Currently, there are more than 140 Ukrainian EW manufacturers, with more than 30 solutions already codified according to NATO standards. While most current EW solutions are short-range, focused on simple white-noise jamming, ongoing work aims to develop more powerful, long-range solutions, as well as &quot;smarter&quot; EW capable of operating in challenging environments. This list is not exhaustive, and some developments may be announced after the fact for maximum impact. While uncertainty remains, one thing is clear: Ukraine has established itself as a global defense tech hub and will continue to innovate, surprising not only its enemies but the world as well.

Greenpeace urges IAEA to block Russia's Zaporizhzhia reactor restart as Grossi visits Kyiv	Greenpeace Ukraine has urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent Russia from illegally restarting reactors at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the organization said in a Feb. 4 press release. The appeal comes as IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi is visiting Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian officials before heading to Moscow to discuss the situation with Russian authorities. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear facility, since March 2022. The power station has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&apos;s power grid due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, increasing the risk of a nuclear disaster. Greenpeace warned Grossi that Russian officials have recently expressed intentions to restart the reactors to generate electricity for Russia and solidify their control over the plant. In December 2024, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev said restarting the plant&apos;s reactors was the Russian state nuclear company&apos;s &quot;dream.&quot; Sergey Kiriyenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s first deputy chief of staff, similarly noted that Moscow intended to restart the reactors &quot;as fast as possible.&quot; Greenpeace stressed that there is no legal or safety justification for restarting any reactors at the plant under the current occupation. &quot;So long as Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains under illegal Russian occupation, there are no conditions that permit the restart of reactors,&quot; said Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Ukraine. &quot;If the Russian occupation is not ended, there is the very real prospect of the IAEA secretariat collaborating with Russia&apos;s plans for the restart.&quot; Grossi previously said that a restart is impossible under current wartime conditions but has reportedly discussed with Rosatom the possibility of preparing the plant for future operations when conditions allow.	https://kyivindependent.com/greenpeace-urges-iaea-to-block-russias-zaporizhzhia-reactor-restart-amid-grossis-kyiv-visit/	2025-02-04T01:48:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1673593890.jpg
Ukraine's Southern Operational Command chief steps down after being appointed NATO liaison	Brigadier General Hennadii Shapovalov, Ukraine&apos;s Southern Operational Command chief, announced his resignation on Feb. 4 after he was appointed to the NATO military aid coordination center in Germany. &quot;It was an honor to be the commander of the troops of the Southern Operational Command chief &#x2014; a powerful military team that has been courageously and selflessly defending the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine in all directions since the first days of the Russian-Ukrainian war,&quot; Shapovalov said in his statement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in mid-January Shapovalov&apos;s appointment to a new position coordinating military assistance to Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany. The city hosts NATO&apos;s Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), a center established as part of key commitments at the allied summit in July 2024. Shapovalov is a graduate of the U.S. Army War College, which trains senior officers of the U.S. military. He previously commanded Ukraine&apos;s 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and was promoted to brigadier general in 2022. The commander led the Southern Operational Command since April 2024 after replacing Andrii Kovalchuk amid broader military personnel changes.	https://kyivindependent.com/shapovalov-steps-down/	2025-02-04T01:27:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/437485241_750939180499660_6831791159206116970_n.jpg
Russian soldiers face execution threats to retake lost ground near Kupiansk, Ukraine claims	Russian commanders in the Kupiansk sector are ordering their soldiers to retake positions from which they retreated under Ukrainian fire, threatening them with execution if they refuse, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces claimed on Feb. 4, citing intelligence reports. Ukrainian soldiers forced Russian troops to abandon forward positions near a settlement in the Kupiansk sector following intensive assaults, the unit said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian forces intensified their assault on Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast in September 2024, pushing toward the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several attempts to enter the town throughout December. The estimated Russian advance in the Kupiansk district, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Feb. 4, 2025. A white symbol marks the city of Kupiansk. (DeepState / OpenStreetMaps)For months, Russia has sought to establish a foothold along the eastern bank of the Oskil River, attempting to outflank Ukrainian defenses and open the way for a rear attack on Kupiansk. The front line now lies just 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the town. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia group as Ukraine works to counter Russian advances in the sector. Western and Ukrainian officials have pointed to poor morale among Russian troops since the outbreak of the full-scale war. Moscow employs the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics in which its troops overwhelm Ukrainian defenders through sheer numbers despite suffering heavy losses. Reports of Russian commanders executing their soldiers have also surfaced amid some of the heaviest battles of the war, for example, during Russia&apos;s siege of the stronghold town of Avdiivka in late 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-commanders-execution-threats/	2025-02-04T00:47:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
2 killed, 13 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks against multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 4. Russia launched 65 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-seven drones were shot down over five oblasts, while 28 others were lost in the airspace without causing any damage, according to the statement. Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast killed one person in the town of Pokrovsk, injured one civilian in the village of Rubtsi, and another in the village of Bahatyr, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A 71-year-old woman was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 3, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. An ambulance was also damaged in a separate Russian attack against the town. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured nine, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. A civilian was also injured during a Russian drone attack against the Seredyna-Buda community of Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. Drone debris damaged an unfinished 18-story building and a clinic in the Pechersk district of Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. No casualties or fires were reported. Twelve Russian drones were shot down over Cherkasy Oblast, causing fires at three enterprises in Cherkasy but inflicting no casualties, Governor Ihor Taburets.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-124/	2025-02-04T00:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-04_09-55-28.jpg
Selfish' — Scholz blasts Trump's aid-for-rare earths Ukraine plan	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s proposal to tie military aid for Ukraine to access to the country&apos;s rare earth resources, calling it &quot;very selfish and self-centered,&quot; Spiegel reported on Feb. 4. Speaking after an informal meeting of European leaders in Brussels, Scholz reportedly stressed that Ukraine should first be helped to &quot;get back on its feet&quot; and that its resources should be used for reconstruction after the war. This comes as Trump told reporters on Feb. 3 that he was seeking a deal where Ukraine would &quot;secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; though he did not specify which materials Washington is targeting. A source in the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that sharing Ukrainian resources with allies is already part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; which has been presented to foreign leaders, including Trump. Trump&apos;s remarks come amid uncertainty over the future of the U.S. aid to Ukraine. The U.S. has provided $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with assistance remaining unaffected by the current aid freeze, Zelensky confirmed on Jan. 25. Non-military programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have lost funding under the new administration. USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budgetary support. In response to the funding cuts, Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary committee on humanitarian and information policy has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. funding. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, the chancellor has resisted providing Taurus long-range cruise missiles, citing escalation concerns. Scholz has also blocked the proposed additional security assistance for Ukraine worth 3 billion ($3.09 billion) euros unless it is covered by additional government borrowing. The plan, backed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, included three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/selfish-scholz-slams-trumps-proposal-to-tie-ukraine-aid-to-rare-earth-access-spiegel-reports/	2025-02-03T23:29:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147904710.jpg
Trump officially appoints Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine, Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 3 officially appointed retired General Keith Kellogg as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Voice of America correspondent Kateryna Lisunova reported. &quot;We made a lot of progress on Russia-Ukraine,&quot; Trump reportedly said after signing the decree without providing further details. Kellogg previously served as the executive secretary and the chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration and was a top advisor to then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. He was scheduled to visit Ukraine in January after Trump&apos;s election and before the inauguration, but the trip was postponed for legal reasons. Kellogg has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin a &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; Trump&apos;s envoy said he believes the new U.S. president can broker a satisfactory deal for both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kellogg told Reuters on Feb. 1 that Ukraine&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the full-scale war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that holding elections during wartime would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. The Trump administration is debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. Kellogg also suggested using frozen Russian assets to purchase American weapons for Ukraine, as reported by Fox News on Jan. 24. Zelensky recently emphasized the need to end the war diplomatically in 2025, suggesting that a Trump administration could accelerate the process. Kellogg defined the &quot;near term&quot; end to the war as 100 days out from the inauguration and said it was his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution by that point.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-appoints-keith-kellogg-as-special-envoy-for-ukraine-russia/	2025-02-03T23:00:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
North Korean troops absent from front in Russia's Kursk Oblast since mid-January, Seoul says	North Korean troops have not been fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since mid-January, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 4, citing South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency. This comes as another confirmation that the originally 11,000-12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has been pulled back after suffering significant losses. Moscow&apos;s key ally Pyongyang sent the troops last fall to help Russian forces oust Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the Russian border region of Kursk since early August 2024. Kyiv hopes to leverage its positions there in potential negotiations. &quot;Since mid-January, there have been no signs showing North Korean troops deployed to the Russian Kursk region engaging in battle,&quot; South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said, suggesting that heavy losses may have been one of the reasons for their withdrawal. Seoul previously said that 300 North Korean soldiers had been killed and 2,700 injured fighting in the war, while the Ukrainian military estimated that as many as half of the contingent had been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. At the same time, many Ukrainian military service members and observers described North Korean troops as highly motivated and presenting a significant challenge to Ukrainian soldiers. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed for the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent at the time, confirming the reports. Previous comments by Ukrainian officials suggest that North Korean troops may have been taken off the front lines only temporarily. The military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said he expects Pyongyang to dispatch additional reinforcements to Russia, namely artillery units.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-absent-from-front-seoul-says/	2025-02-03T22:50:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-668705966.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 842,930 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 842,930 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 4. This number includes 1,270 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,938 tanks, 20,709 armored fighting vehicles, 35,921 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,655 artillery systems, 1,269 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,053 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,003 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-3/	2025-02-03T22:14:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/IMG_2727--1--2.jpg
Russia proposes easing conscription rules for people with certain mental disorders, syphilis, NGO reports	Russia&apos;s Ministry of Defense has proposed changes to military medical examination rules that would simplify the conscription of individuals with psychosis, hypertension, and syphilis. The amendments would also make it harder for soldiers to be discharged for health reasons during mobilization, according to a report by a Russian independent non-profit organization (Movement of Conscientious Objectors to military service in Russia). Currently, individuals diagnosed with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis are exempt from conscription under category &quot;B,&quot; meaning they are considered limitedly fit and not subject to the draft in peacetime. However, under the proposed amendments, they would instead be classified as fit for service with minor restrictions. Similar changes would apply to conscripts suffering from moderate, short-term endogenous psychoses and severe neurotic psychoses related to stress or mood disorders. These individuals, who were previously assigned category &quot;D&quot; (unfit for service), would now be deemed eligible with some restrictions. Additionally, the amendments remove an important provision that allowed for consideration of pre-existing illnesses that worsened after enlistment when determining a soldier&#x2019;s fitness. Under the new rules, such cases would no longer be formally recognized as a basis for discharge, further tightening restrictions on medical exemptions. According to an explanatory note, the Ministry of Defense developed these amendments to &quot;improve the system of medical examination of servicemen&quot; by incorporating lessons from the ongoing war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-easing-conscription-rules-for-people-with-certain-mental-disorders-syphilis-ngo-reports/	2025-02-03T21:47:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247591136.jpg
Ukraine secures return of 12 children from Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully brought back 12 children who had been forcibly taken to Russian-occupied territory, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak announced late on Feb. 3. The effort was part of the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, a program under President Volodymyr Zelensky aimed at rescuing Ukrainian children deported by Russia. Yermak said the children who returned home include a 16-year-old girl who lost her mother, a 17-year-old who had been issued a summons to join the Russian army, and an eight-year-old girl. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Ukraine considers these abductions a war crime and argues that they meet the U.N.&apos;s legal definition of genocide. Russia often claims it is relocating children to protect them from conflict zones. According to the Ministry of Reintegration, the government has managed to return 388 children so far. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&apos;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-12-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2025-02-03T19:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/dscf6830-1668456828oat5c.jpg
Trump expected to withdraw US from UN Human Rights Council, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Feb. 4 that the United States will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council and extend a freeze on funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, a White House official told Reuters. The move comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington. Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of UNRWA, accusing the agency of inciting anti-Israel sentiment and alleging that some of its staff members have ties to terrorism. During his first term from 2017 to 2021, Trump also halted U.S. contributions to UNRWA, arguing that the agency required reforms and that funding should be contingent on Palestinian participation in peace talks with Israel. His administration withdrew from the 47-member Human Rights Council in 2018, citing what it described as a persistent bias against Israel and a failure to implement reforms. The U.S. later rejoined the council under President Joe Biden, serving a term from 2022 to 2024. The Human Rights Council is set to review the United States&apos; human rights record in August as part of its routine evaluation of all member states. While the council lacks legal authority, its discussions carry political significance and can generate international pressure for policy changes. Since returning to office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has also ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, mirroring decisions made during his first administration. The U.S. was previously UNRWA&apos;s largest donor, contributing between $300 million and $400 million annually. However, in January 2024, Biden paused funding after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA employees of involvement in the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. In response, the U.S. Congress formally suspended contributions to the agency until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides essential aid, healthcare, and education services to millions of Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-expected-to-withdraw-us-from-un-human-rights-council/	2025-02-03T18:12:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
UK to provide more military aid to Ukraine this year than ever before, Starmer says	The United Kingdom will provide more military support to Ukraine in 2025 than it ever has before, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 3. The U.K. previously announced plans to deliver unprecedented military assistance to Ukraine this year, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. &quot;We must do all that we can to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Starmer said at a joint press conference alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels. &quot;That means stabilizing the front line, providing the kit and training that they need, and that&apos;s why this year the UK will give more military support to Ukraine than ever before.&quot; Starmer&apos;s comments come weeks after the U.K. and Ukraine signed a historic 100-year partnership agreement in Kyiv. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. During the press conference, Starmer described the devastating effects of Russia&apos;s full-scale war that he encountered on his recent visit to Kyiv. &quot;I saw residential buildings destroyed just days before,&quot; he said. &quot;I met soldiers in the ICU recovering from really terrible burns. And I met children whose parents are out there now on the front line, and it&apos;s yet another reminder that this is a war not just in Ukraine, but a war on Ukraine, against those children and their future.&quot; Starmer said it was essential for Ukraine&apos;s allies, particularly its European partners, to step up to help Kyiv meet its defense needs. He also mentioned U.S President Donald Trump&apos;s recent threat of santions against Russia. &quot;It&apos;s clear that&apos;s got (Russian President Vladimir) Putin rattled,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;We know that he&apos;s worried about the state of the Russian economy. So I&apos;m here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin&apos;s war machine.&quot; The U.K. and other European countries have pledged to play a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia amid the transition in the U.S. government. Trump has already limited U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine and other countries, and it is unclear what the future holds for ongoing weapons shipments from Washington to Kyiv. Starmer has promised that the U.K. will play its &quot;full part&quot; in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, possibly including the deployment of British troops to monitor a ceasefire on the ground.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-more-military-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-than-ever-before-starmer-says/	2025-02-03T16:29:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196935320.jpg
US briefly paused weapons to Kyiv in first days of Trump term, sources tell Reuters	The United States briefly stopped shipping weapons to Ukraine as the new White House administration debated its policies toward Kyiv, Reuters reported on Feb. 3, citing four sources familiar with the matter. U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, upending U.S. foreign policy with freezes on international development funds and promises to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. The Trump administration was initially inclined to stop all aid to Ukraine, but arms deliveries resumed over the weekend following internal discussion, two of the sources told Reuters. Opposing factions within the administration are debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons, a U.S. official said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days. The order disrupts NGOs doing vital infrastructure and humanitarian aid projects in Ukraine, but Ukrainian officials assured the freeze did not affect weapons deliveries. Trump told reporters on Feb. 3 that the U.S. is looking to strike a deal with Kyiv that would provide continued aid in exchange for Ukrainian rare earth elements. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; he said. The New York Times reported in December that Ukrainian authorities postponed signing an agreement with the U.S. on extracting rare earth minerals in order to let Trump take credit for the deal after his inauguration. President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine as a security guarantee that would strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-briefly-paused-weapons-to-kyiv-in-first-days-of-trump-term-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-02-03T14:42:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
We need the corps system' — Zelensky approves plan to restructure army	Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces are transitioning to a new organizational structure intended to modernize the army, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 3. The announcement comes after Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that reforming the army&apos;s structure and shifting to a corps-based system was among the military&apos;s key priorities. &quot;A plan has already been approved to transition to a new organizational structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. According to Zelensky, the government and the military are now focused on implementing the restructure plan with an eye toward modernizing Ukrainian forces. &quot;We need the corps system,&quot; the president said. &quot;Today we discussed approaches to the appointment of corps commanders: these should be the best-trained, most promising officers with combat experience and modern thinking. The army must be modern.&quot; The relevant decisions regarding the organizational restructure will be made public, Zelensky said. Syrskyi reported earlier on Feb. 3 that the organizational reforms were already &quot;in progress&quot; and would help strengthen the Armed Forces even as they face difficulties on the battlefield. Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to gain territory in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses. Ukraine also faces on ongoing mobilization struggle, scandals over personnel transfers and mismanaged brigades, and uncertainty over the future of U.S. military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-the-corps-system-zelensky-approves-plan-to-restructure-army/	2025-02-03T13:50:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196064752.jpg
Rubio takes control of USAID amid Musk's threats to shut down agency	U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting adminstrator over the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to a statement published Feb. 3. The announcement comes shortly after billionaire Elon Musk claimed that he had Trump&apos;s approval to shut down the agency. &#xA0; Trump has named Rubio acting administrator &quot;as an interim step toward gaining control and better understanding over the agency&apos;s activity,&quot; the state department said in a press release. USAID has &quot;long strayed from its original mission of responsibly advancing American interests abroad,&quot; the statement read. &quot;As we evaluate USAID and ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda and the efforts of the State Department, we will continue to protect the American people&apos;s interests and ensure their tax dollars are not wasted.&quot; Rubio told reporters in El Salvador that he would delegate day-to-day oversight of the agency to an official who has not yet been named. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, funds initiatives ranging from women&apos;s health in conflict zones and clean water access to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and civil society. During Trump&apos;s first days in office, the administration announced a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance, effectively halting USAID&apos;s programming and threatening vital development projects worldwide. Musk, head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) and world&apos;s richest man, has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization.&quot; He claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump &quot;agreed that we should shut (the agency) down.&quot; USAID staff were instructed to stay away from the agency&apos;s Washington headquarters and over 600 employees were locked out of the computer network, the Associated Press reported. Democratic lawmakers have assembled outside USAID headquarters to protest Trump&apos;s attacks on the agency. Senator Chris Van Hollen said the takeover of the agency constituted an &quot;illegal power grab&quot; and &quot;a corrupt abuse of power.&quot;Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. This funding has helped rebuild schools, finance bomb shelters, and equip hospitals with advanced medical equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-takes-control-of-usaid-amid-musks-threats-to-shut-down-agency/	2025-02-03T13:01:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kursk operation, long-range strikes into Russia — Syrskyi outlines Ukraine's priorities	Key developments on Feb. 3: Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 named Ukraine&apos;s operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and strikes against military facilities deep inside Russian territory as Kyiv&apos;s key battlefield priorities. &quot;We continue effectively destroying Russia&apos;s military facilities to reduce its strike potential. We are destroying Russian forces both in Ukraine and Russia,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on social media. The commander outlined Ukraine&apos;s key priorities, including holding defensive lines, preventing Russian advances, and enhancing the use of unmanned systems. &quot;On the ground, first of all, we saturate units holding the defenses at the front line with personnel and equipment,&quot; Syrskyi said. He stressed the need to improve recruitment and psychological support for soldiers and better integrate newcomers from training centers before they undertake combat missions. Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone strikes on Russian oil facilities in the past weeks, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and weaken Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s war effort. In Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been holding positions since the start of the cross-border incursion in August 2024, reportedly seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Kyiv seeks to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to have Ukraine supply the U.S. with rare earths as a condition for aid for the war-torn country. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 3. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he added. Trump did not specify what kind of materials Washington is seeking from Kyiv. A source in the President&apos;s Office familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent that sharing Ukrainian resources with allies was part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; shown to foreign leaders, including Trump. &quot;But for this, (Ukrainian) security must be guaranteed so that the Russians do not occupy this Ukrainian land with minerals,&quot; the source told the Kyiv Independent. Trump&apos;s remarks come amid uncertainty over the future of the U.S. aid to Ukraine. Ukraine is already using laser technologies to hit Russian targets, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. &quot;Laser technologies are already hitting certain objects at a certain altitude,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. The commander first said in mid-December 2024 that Ukraine is among the few nations with laser weapon capabilities. According to Sukharevskyi, Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than a year ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. When asked how successful the development of these technologies has been, Sukharevskyi said that the Ukrainian military&apos;s R&amp;D (Research and Development) &quot;involves a number of areas.&quot; The new system was the result of efforts to find an effective countermeasure against Russian aircraft and drones, specifically Shahed-type attack drones, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these claims. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late January, the Unmanned Systems Forces said that Ukraine deployed a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. U.S. military aid to Ukraine was delayed not only by opposition from congressional Republicans but also by concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict with Russia, Reuters said in its analysis published on Feb. 3. Further complicating deliveries was a chaotic weapons-tracking system in which different branches of the U.S. military reportedly used varying definitions of &quot;delivered,&quot; creating confusion over how much aid reached Ukraine. The most significant delays nevertheless stemmed from months of congressional gridlock in later 2023 and early 2024 over approving $60 billion in additional military assistance, mainly due to Republican resistance, the news agency wrote. Democratic and Republican lawmakers had urged House Speaker Mike Johnson for months to bring the aid package to a vote. Hard-line Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump reportedly pressured Johnson to block further assistance to Kyiv. Even after Congress approved the funding, U.S. military aid to Ukraine remained inconsistent, Reuters reported, citing sources in Washington and Kyiv. By November 2024, Ukraine had received only half of the military aid the U.S. had promised for that year from existing Pentagon stockpiles. According to the analysis, only 30% of the pledged armored vehicles had been delivered by early December. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is alarmed over a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, according to a press release obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 3. A total of 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents have been recorded by the mission since the end of August 2024. Presumably, some of these incidents concern group executions. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia during the war. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda that as of mid-December 2024, Kyiv had recorded the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers, with 109 of them last year. The U.N. mission interviewed witnesses and analyzed videos and photos published by Ukrainian and Russian sources showing killings or dead bodies of Ukrainian POWs. The mission also said it had documented the execution of an injured and incapacitated &#x2014; but not yet captured &#x2014; Russian soldier by the Ukrainian army in 2024. Kyiv has not commented on this report. Many Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered or were in the custody of the Russian forces were shot dead on the spot, according to the statement. Unarmed and wounded Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, witnesses said. The reported executions took place in areas where Russian offensive operations were ongoing. According to Danielle Bell, the head of the mission, Russian public figures have explicitly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of captured Ukrainian soldiers, with at least three such appeals recorded by the mission along with social media posts made by Russian military-linked groups. &quot;These incidents did not occur in a vacuum,&quot; Bell said. &quot;All allegations of execution of captured Ukrainian military personnel and public statements calling for, or condoning, such actions must be investigated.&quot; The statement that &quot;no quarter&quot; will be given is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime, according to the statement.

Unmanned Systems Forces have carried out over 220 operations deep into Russia since its establishment, commander says	Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) have conducted over 220 operations deep inside Russian territory in the six months since its creation, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the USF, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare tactics. &quot;Our units have conducted over 220 operations to engage the enemy on Russian territory. More than 3,500 weapons have been launched so far,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. Ukrainian bomber drones and the units that use them are &quot;extremely efficient,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. Ukrainian bomber drones have recently hit targets over 50 kilometers (31 miles) deep inside Russia, the commander added. Work is also underway to systematize various types of software systems, develop tactics, and use ground robotic systems, according to Sukharevskyi. &quot;We have already begun the process of synchronizing and developing the components of activities at sea regarding defense and attack. And I think we will move on to the practical part very soon,&quot; he said. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. The USF said on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. Ukraine also produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, according to Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin.	https://kyivindependent.com/unmanned-systems-forces-have-carried-out-over-220-operations-deep-into-russia-since-its-establishment-commander-says/	2025-02-03T12:25:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2864.jpg
Ukrainian citizen beaten to death in Bratislava, media reports	A homeless Ukrainian citizen was beaten to death in Bratislava, Slovakia, the Slovak media outlet Aktuality reported on Feb. 3. The Ukrainian man was found on Jan. 30 in front of the Nivy shopping center in Bratislava with serious injuries to his head and body. He was hospitalized but died the next day due to the severity of his injuries. The man was previously caught stealing from the New Yorker clothing store in Nivy. Later, he was taken to a back room of the shopping center, as seen on the surveillance cameras. Slovak police are investigating several versions of the circumstances surrounding the death of a Ukrainian national, according to Aktuality. Local law enforcement agencies have not ruled out the possibility that the man was beaten by police and private security guards. The paramedic who treated the man also pointed to a possible beating as the cause of the victim&apos;s injuries. The Ukrainian Embassy has reached out to the Slovak police and Slovakia&apos;s ombudsman. &quot;Shocked by the tragic death of a Ukrainian citizen in Bratislava. We cannot exclude ethnic hatred as one of the reasons for this crime,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. &quot;We demand an impartial investigation and accountability,&quot; Sybiha added. The death of the Ukrainian citizen comes amid increased tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, a long-time opponent of military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly policies sparked widespread demonstrations throughout Slovakia, which his government has blamed on an alleged Ukrainian-backed coup. Fico has not provided evidence to support the allegations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-citizen-beaten-to-death-in-bratislava-media-reports/	2025-02-03T12:24:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Bratislava_m-_stanicu-_ktor-_sa_vyrovn-_eur-pskym_metropol-m__Nazrite_do_Nivy_centra_-51536059094-.jpg
From drone simulators to civics: Ukraine reforms school curriculum to protect next generation from Russian threat	In a small town in Kyiv Oblast, 10th grader Alina Marynenko just beat her entire class to be the most accurate shooter on an AK-47 simulator. &quot;Fourteen out of fifteen! I set a record! We beat the boys!&quot; Marynenko yells out to her class. Marynenko and her classmates fired the simulated weapon during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson, an experimental course part of a wider educational reform passed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The course has been part of the Ukrainian school curriculum since Soviet times, also known over the years as &quot;Pre-Conscription Training&quot; and &quot;Defense of the Homeland.&quot; If before 2022, the subject was seen as obsolete, hardly taken seriously by students who at times saw it more as an opportunity to goof off, Russia&#x2019;s all-out aggression has given it a new life. &#xA0; Volodymyr Komlyk, a reserve officer in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and teacher of the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)The reform, launched in 2024, has outfitted nearly 600 classrooms at schools that have volunteered to participate in the trial phase with new equipment from first aid training kits, interactive whiteboards and computers, to drone simulators. The new program will be mandatory across all schools in 2027. The authors of the reform and its proponents are quick to distinguish the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; from its counterpart in Russia, where a similar mandatory school program returned basic military training to the curriculum after the start of the full-scale invasion. To distance itself from what many consider to be Russia&#x2019;s attempts at militarizing its youth, the new course in Ukraine includes topics such as civics, geopolitics, and history, in addition to weapons training on simulators. &quot;Every citizen has levers to influence certain processes in our society, the military, the state in general &#x2014; everywhere. And the skills the children acquire (in these classes) can be used in civilian life as well,&quot; Volodymyr Komlyk, a reserve officer in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and teacher of the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; course in Kyiv Oblast course. &quot;Ukraine needs to be defended not only in the trenches.&quot; In Soviet times up until the reform, the course was divided by gender. While boys trained for potential military service, girls learned first aid and the basics of medicine. Before entering the classroom, boys would have to line up to greet the course teacher with a salute or listen to the national anthem. In a different classroom, girls dealt with old rubber tourniquets and bandages. Impractical, and at times unscientific, the knowledge the girls learned would hardly save anyone on the front line today. Various activities during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)Textbooks were often full of outdated information. The classes were frequently taught by P.E., biology, or humanities teachers who at times had to rely on their own experience in teaching the subject. &quot;When I was at school, the teacher would come to class, open a page in a course book, and then his phone would ring. He worked as a taxi driver, and occasionally, he would get called in. We would sit alone and read from our textbook,&quot; Komlyk told the Kyiv Independent. The overall attitude toward the class meant it was often skipped by students, lawmaker Inna Sovsun, one of the authors of the reform, told the Kyiv Independent. The issue was both a lack of trained teachers and the Soviet curriculum, she said. School children during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)Sovsun said the main goal of the change was to remove everything related to outdated Soviet army regulations from the course materials. It also did away with separating the students by gender. The move didn&#x2019;t sit well with opponents who felt girls shouldn&#x2019;t be learning military basics, Sovsun said. &quot;During work with focus groups, one of the teachers made the point that girls should not be taught to shoot because they do not have enough strength in their fingers to pull the trigger,&quot; Sovsun said. Besides merging girls&apos; and boys&apos; classes, the program also added introductory sections on drones, as well as updated units on marksmanship training, terrain orienteering, crisis response, and the basics of national security and defense of Ukraine, among other topics.

(Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)The program&#x2019;s backers maintain they are not aiming to train 16 and 17-year-olds to be soldiers, but preparing them for a reality where Russian aggression is ongoing, with no clear end in sight. &quot;Can you imagine how many weapons are now in the hands of the military who will be returning home, where children live?&#x201D; Sovsun said, in reference to the importance of knowing how to properly handle weapons. &quot;I am also a mom. I don&apos;t want to prepare my children for military service, but it&#x2019;s my goal as a mother to make sure they know how to protect themselves so that Russia can&#x2019;t invade again in the future, and this knowledge isn&#x2019;t even needed.&#x201D; As the bell rings, the children head downstairs to a classroom that also serves as a shelter &#x2014; instead of desks, chairs are strewn across the room, which has been divided up into different zones for group activities and drone and shooting simulators. Komlyk works with 350 children from the 10th and 11th grades. Lessons are scheduled over 12 days a month, and children spend the entire school day at the location. Komlyk&apos;s school hosts its students and those from nearby smaller settlements. The name of the town where the school is located is not being disclosed for security reasons. &quot;We have merged some classes so that no more than 24 pupils are in each. Unfortunately, many children do not make it to class because of air raid alerts,&quot; Komlyk said.

The drone is very sensitive. I wouldn&apos;t say that it&apos;s much harder to operate this controller. I think it&apos;s more a matter of the drone itself.

The only goal is to overcome neon-colored obstacles. The same goes for the shooting simulator: children use toy weapons without ammunition to shoot at moving or stationary targets, and a computer records the results. &quot;I asked the children why we needed this subject in the first lesson. Many of them answered, &apos;For going to the trench at 18,&#x2019;&quot; Komlyk said. &quot;I explained that Ukraine needs to be defended not only at the front line. It can be done in the public, political, media, or cultural sectors. The statements voiced by the children are a consequence of the old approach to teaching this subject,&quot; the teacher added. Student Arianna Safronova said one of her favorite activities is the game &quot;Two Countries,&quot; which aims to give children a basic understanding of what factors lead to the prosperity or collapse of a state. Schoolchildren practice with guns and eat apples during a &quot;Defense of Ukraine&quot; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)&quot;We are now learning what a community is, its value and importance, and who we are,&quot; Safronova said, but added that she considers first aid to be the most important block of the course as Russia&#x2019;s war continues. Meanwhile, in 2024, the Russian state introduced a mandatory discipline for middle and high school called the &quot;Fundamentals of Security and Defense of the Motherland.&#x201D; The new course replaced the course &quot;Fundamentals of Life Safety&quot; (FLS), returning basic military training to the curriculum. For about 60 years, Soviet schoolchildren assembled and disassembled assault rifles, learned how to put on gas masks, and provided first aid during the lessons of &quot;Basic Military Training&quot; (BMT). This subject was removed from the school curriculum in the late 1980s and replaced with FLS. Discussions on its return were raised at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sergei Mironov, leader of the Just Russia &#x2014; For Truth party, said in 2022 that the resumption of BMT would help &quot;systematically prepare citizens for a possible confrontation with the enemy.&quot; The course is also intended to teach high school students how to use weapons and help employ war veterans who fought in Ukraine, according to Mironov. The topics for the revised course were developed in cooperation with the Russian Defense Ministry, with reserve lieutenant colonel Yuriy Kostikin from the Moscow Suvorov School leading the reform, according to the pro-Kremlin newspaper Lenta. As early as the first lesson, children should be taught how the Russian army was formed and that &quot;military service is the duty and obligation of every man,&#x201D; Kostikin said. Teenagers will learn about the principle of unity of command in the military and must internalize that &quot;the commander is always right,&quot; he said. The children will also go on several-day camps to practice their newly acquired skills in a hands-on environment, learning how to dig trenches, navigate the terrain, and survive in adverse conditions. The program in Russia requires children to memorize military regulations, as well as to obey the commands of &quot;Attention&quot; and &quot;Stand at ease.&quot; The updated course is mandatory only for boys, while girls can opt to study medicine. While Russia only made this subject compulsory in 2024, many Russian children have already been learning these skills in other forms, according to Jade McGlynn, a Leverhulme EC Researcher in the War Studies department at King&apos;s College London. Military and patriotic clubs, as well as ideological movements for youth, are widespread in Russia. The most well-known is the Young Army Cadets National Movement (&quot;Young Army&quot;), which is subordinated to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. Established in 2016, the &quot;Young Army &quot; is now sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland due to its militarization of children. McGlynn noted that Russia is making significant efforts to militarize younger generation of Russians, as they are quite vulnerable and easily influenced by different views in their age. A Russian army officer wearing a &#x201C;Z&#x201D; symbol, associated with support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, demonstrates a Kalashnikov assault rifle to a boy during a pro-military event in Krasnogorsk, Russia, on Feb. 24, 2024. The event, organized by local authorities, coincides with the second anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. (Contributor / Getty Images)Whether students are even interested in military training is no matter, McGlynn says, as the Russian state goes to length to ensure the interest emerges. &quot;The more you know about something, the more likely you&apos;ll become interested in it,&quot; she said. Russia has aimed its efforts to militarize young people in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine as well. Russia&#x2019;s proxies there have launched cadet classes, held events such as &quot;Vacations with the Russian Guard,&quot; and openly demonize Ukraine and the government in Kyiv. &quot;All (Ukrainian) children in occupation who&apos;ve lived through the war are going to be effectively militarized anyway just by having to grow up in such a horror,&quot; McGlynn said. &quot;This is not just about training children for war, in Russia&apos;s case. There is a deeply ideological, genocidal element of destroying their Ukrainian identity as well.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s very hard to destroy a person&apos;s identity. But the sort of pressure that Ukrainian children are placed under during the formative period of their self-realization means that, unfortunately, there is a strong possibility that Russia&#x2019;s efforts could be effective.&quot; Russian teenagers take part in a ceremony to join the patriotic Youth Army cadet movement in the main hall of the Stalingrad Battle Museum in Volgograd, Russia, on Jan. 25, 2023.

(Contributor / Getty Images)According to the Ukrainian government&apos;s official database, over 20,000 Ukrainian children have been displaced to Russian-occupied territories or Russia since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has suggested that this number could be much bigger &#x2014; nearly 150,000. The Ukrainian government, which has recognized the deportation of children as genocide against the Ukrainian people, continues to work to bring them home. Yet, an equally great challenge is to protect Ukrainian youth on Ukraine-controlled territories from Russian influence, which could pose an even more significant threat in the future. &quot;We will never completely eradicate the Russian influence. It will always follow us somewhere on social media or while traveling worldwide,&quot; said Arianna Safronova, the Ukrainian 10th grader. &quot;Every citizen must realize that they are Ukrainians. Ukrainian culture exists, and our heritage is very powerful, just like our country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/from-drone-simulators-to-civics-ukrainian-reforms-school-curriculum-to-protect-next-generation-from-russian-threat/	2025-02-03T12:04:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/--------------------------------------------_-------------------_----------2024.JPG
Ukraine announces privatization auction of country’s largest electromagnetic switch manufacturer	Ukraine&#x2019;s State Property Fund announced an auction to privatize the state-owned Radiorele plant in Kharkiv &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s largest switching equipment manufacturer, the fund said on Feb. 3. Kyiv has looked to privatize its long list of state-owned assets as a way to shore up its wartime budget. State-run assets are known to be a drain on the state&#x2019;s resources and have at times been feeding grounds for corruption. &#xA0; Ukraine&#x2019;s government included Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) in privatization proceeds in the 2025 budget, which envisions auctioning off both small and large-scale assets. Radiorele produces low-current, miniature, electromagnetic switches, and relays, which are used to control voltage, current, and temperature in electrical systems. The plant has been put up for auction in the past, but has so far been unable to attract a buyer. The auction, which is for a 100% stake in the plant, will be held on Feb. 4. Its starting price is Hr 234.4 million ($5.6 million), which includes debts for the last six months. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the enterprise&#x2019;s debt was Hr 2.4 million ($57,339), including wage arrears of Hr 755,000 ($17,933) and arrears to Ukraine&#x2019;s budget of Hr 697,000 ($16,555). The new owner must commit to keeping all 66 of the firm&apos;s associates employed for the next six months, the fund said. Ukraine privatized several high-profile state-owned assets at the end of last year, including the iconic Hotel Ukraina located in downtown Kyiv and the titanium producer giant UMCC-Titanium. Businessman Maksym Krippa purchased Hotel Ukraina on Sept. 18 for $60 million. UMCC-Titanium was sold to Cremin Ukraine on Oct. 9 for $96 million. Despite a couple of recent big ticket privatization sales, the country&apos;s efforts to offload its assets has been slow to take over the years. Announced auctions have failed due to the absence of bidders. After Kirppa&apos;s company Ola Fine paid for Hotel Ukraina, the fund&apos;s revenue plan for 2024 through privatizations exceeded its goal for 2024 for the first time in many years.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wants-to-privatize-countrys-largest-electromagnetic-switch-manufacturer/	2025-02-03T11:37:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1238672587.jpg
Trump seeks Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to have Ukraine supply the U.S. with rare earths as a condition for aid for the war-torn country, news agency AFP reported on Feb. 3. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Ukraine expressed its willingness to cooperate in supplying the essential materials, as many sectors rely on them, according to Trump. Trump did not specify what kind of materials Washington is seeking from Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-seeking-ukrainian-rare-earths-in-exchange-for-aid/	2025-02-03T11:13:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150483714.jpg
Ukrainian bakery Lviv Croissants opens first French location in Cannes	Ukrainian cafe chain Lviv Croissants opened its first restaurant in Cannes, France, making it the fifth country outside of Ukraine where it now operates, the company said in a press release on Feb. 3. Founded in Lviv in 2015, the chain has since grown to over 196 locations across Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, the U.S., and now, France. The franchise is known for its croissants stuffed with both sweet and savory fillings. Lviv Croissants said it chose Cannes as its first French location &#x201C;because of the impressive tourist flow and high prospects for the gastronomic business.&#x201D; The 70-square-meter restaurant is located in the center of Cannes, in the bustling shopping district of Rue d&apos;Antibes. The new location seats 13 people inside and 24 outside on the terrace during the warmer months. The company spent six months researching the local market and food preferences before opening the new location. Locally-based chefs were hired to create croissant fillings that will only be served in France. The French menu includes more than 35 options, such as a goat cheese, honey, and nut croissant, a mortadella, pear, and gorgonzola croissant, and another with raclette cheese and cured ham. &#x201C;Everything else has remained the same: the traditional Lviv atmosphere, delicious quality coffee, and high standards of service. This is what visitors all over the world know and love us for,&#x201D; the company said in its press release. The chain said it is planning to open more locations in France, as well as launch a delivery service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-bakery-lviv-croissants-opens-first-french-location-in-cannes/	2025-02-03T10:52:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475906225_18441142147077863_1549274476716618369_n.jpg
‘We are where we're needed:’ The local entrepreneurs, businesses who stay in front-line Donetsk Oblast	DRUZHKIVKA, Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; A loud explosion goes off, followed by a second. People begin to run in different directions. Despite the chaos, taxi driver Serhiy Pohrebnyakov sits calmly behind the wheel, waiting for customers. Pohrebnyakov&#x2019;s wife and daughter fled Druzhkivka after the start of the full-scale invasion, leaving him alone in the town. Amid near-daily Russian attacks, Pohrebnyakov goes out on his route every day to make money to help his family, he says. &#x201C;I work to earn money for my family, who are now in Germany,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;They don&apos;t send me money here, I send money to them. I also look after our home here because who knows what will happen next.&#x201D; &#x201C;When my daughter calls me and says, &#x2018;Dad, I love you,&#x2019; it gives me the strength to get up in the morning and drive,&#x201D; he tells the Kyiv Independent. Druzhkivka is located a mere 15 kilometers (9 miles) from one of the hottest spots on the front line, the embattled town of Chasiv Yar. As Russia advances in the east, it has come under increased shelling and aerial attacks by Russian forces, the head of the Druzhkivka military administration says. A local resident goes to the water pump room to get some water in Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 18, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)This is not the first time Druzhkivka has been threatened by a Russian invasion. It was occupied once before in 2014 when Russian-backed proxies took control of the town for nearly four months before being liberated by Ukraine. As Russia pushes westward toward the town, an uptick in attacks is damaging homes, businesses, and administrative buildings, much of which was rebuilt and developed over the past decade. Around 36,000 people &#x2014; half of Druzhkivka&#x2019;s wartime population &#x2014; have remained in the town. It has also become the new home of around 14,000 internally displaced people, and a hub for soldiers in the rear of the front lines. Those who have stayed, running businesses and organizations, keeping shops open and community centers alive, are vital to maintaining a semblance of normal life amid the devastation, as well as providing goods and services for soldiers in the area. &#xA0; Halyna Khomchenko watches children run around on a colorful playground from the second floor of a school in Druzhkivka. She is an entrepreneur and community activist who decided to stay in Druzhkivka to continue helping the locals. &#x201C;We are where we are needed,&#x201D; she tells the Kyiv Independent. Khomchenko opened the Child Development and Assistance Center in 2023 after the outbreak of the full-scale war. The center has around 50 students from pre-school-aged children to fourth graders. Despite its proximity to the front line and frequent Russian shelling, the center has all the qualities of a normal school life: textbooks are laid out on the desks, math and history lessons are in progress, and kids play during recess.

(Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)Schoolchildren look at their drawings during a break between lessons in Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 16, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)The outbreak of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 forced all schools in Druzhkivka to switch to online learning. Since then, Khomchenko&#x2019;s center has been the only place where students can study in person. &#x201C;We saw that after what they had experienced, children not only need knowledge but also emotional support. The center has become a place where they feel safe, learn, and recover from their traumas,&#x201D; says Khomchenko. Before the full-scale invasion, she ran a rehabilitation center for families who had adopted children in the neighboring village of Shchurove. Russian troops destroyed the rehab center when they occupied the village in May 2022. &#x201C;That wasn&#x2019;t the only place of my strength that was destroyed by the Russians,&#x201D; says Khomchenko. When Druzhkivka came under heavy attacks in early 2022, Russia hit Khomchenko&apos;s family&apos;s bakery, Khoma Khlib &#x2014; or Thomas Bread, in English. At the time, bread had already largely disappeared from the town&#x2019;s shelves due to shortages at the start of the invasion. It took Khomchenko several weeks to reopen their bakery in a new location. &#x201C;We worked around the clock so that people didn&#x2019;t have to worry about the lack of bread, so that the panic would disappear,&#x201D; Khomchenko recalls. Her bakery sold bread at a symbolic price of Hr 10 ($0.24) or distributed it free of charge to those who could not pay. Food is now readily available in the town, and shelves are stocked with bread, including Khomchenko&#x2019;s, as Druzhkivka adjusts to its wartime reality. Reliable access to water is another story, however, as Russian shelling regularly leaves the town&#x2019;s residents without water for several days, or even sometimes weeks.

The small shop where she works stands out among the grey and ruined buildings around it. &#x201C;At 5 a.m., everything is on fire, shining, illuminated,&#x201D; Radchenko says, laughing. Her small shop, located in Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, a village close to Druzhkivka, is always busy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s mostly our boys here. We work for them. We see them off to their positions and meet them when they come back,&#x201D; she says. Radchenko calls her shop a &quot;lost and found.&quot; She keeps lost phones and even a single lost mitten. Under the counter, she has a small handmade toy cat that someone left behind. &#x201C;It was the guys coming from their positions. It was dark, someone lost it. I want the owner to be found. I hope to God that he is alive,&#x201D; Radchenko says. She has been looking for the toy&#x2019;s owner for several months now, but says no one has heard anything about the soldier whom it belongs to, who goes by the call sign &#x201C;Docent.&#x201D; The small shop where Halina Radchenko works in Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, a village close to Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 16, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)The shop has become a place where soldiers shop before and after their missions. It sells hot dogs, coffee, socks, razor blades, cigarettes, deodorants &#x2014; everything soldiers might need while on the front. &#x201C;We already know who likes what. We don&apos;t even need to ask them,&#x201D; adds Radchenko. Russia&#x2019;s attacks are gradually destroying the area&#x2019;s businesses and centers of community life. The historic Druzhkivka factory that produced some of the country&#x2019;s most beloved sweets, including halva, was destroyed in a Russian attack in October 2024. The Altair Ice Arena &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s largest hockey and figure skating rink &#x2014; was struck in a missile attack in January 2023. And an orphanage and boarding school in Druzhkivka that served over 200 children with disabilities before the full-scale invasion was destroyed in March 2023. Despite being so close to the frontline, the local authorities are developing a plan to restore the town, even as the war continues. They are confident that Druzhkivka will have peace, development, and a future as part of Ukraine. &#x201C;We understand that we are on the right track, in the right place, at the right time,&#x201D; Khomchenko says.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-are-where-we-are-needed-the-people-who-choose-to-stay-in-front-line-areas-in-wartorn-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-03T10:32:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0359.JPG
Ukrainian commander involved in liberation of Kharkiv Oblast killed in combat	Anton Spitsyn, who led one of the battlegroups of the Omega special forces, part of the National Guard, died of wounds sustained during a combat mission, Spitsyn&apos;s brother, Oleksandr, wrote on Facebook on Feb. 3. Spitsyn was one of the co-founders of the unit, called the Peaky Blinders after the British crime drama series of the same name. Spitsyn&apos;s unit is currently defending Kharkiv Oblast. Spitsyn had served in Ukraine&apos;s National Guard since the first days of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia on Feb. 24, 2022. &quot;Today is the darkest and hardest day of my life. Today my brother left me. He was the closest and dearest person to me,&quot; Oleksandr Spitsyn wrote. &quot;He lived as a hero and died as a hero.&quot; Anton Spitsyn was born and raised in Kharkiv Oblast. Prior to the full-scale invasion, he owned a construction business and was involved in charity work, particularly teaching English to orphans for free, the Omega special forces statement read. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian troops find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian soldiers. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-commander-involved-in-liberation-of-kharkiv-oblast-dies-on-combat-mission/	2025-02-03T10:20:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/474857526_593641620315938_662519797290556589_n.jpg
Let's leave judgment to historians' — Orban evades question of whether he considers Russia responsible for war	Prime Minister Viktor Orban evaded answering the question of whether he personally considers Russia an aggressor state, proposing to &quot;leave judgment to historians,&quot; Swiss media outlet Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported on Feb. 3. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly, has repeatedly criticized aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs and escalates the war. &quot;Let&apos;s leave the judgment to the historians. I am a politician, and we have an EU decision. It obliges me to speak of &apos;Russian aggression,&apos;&quot; Orban told Neue Zurcher Zeitung. Orban also believed that Russia did not pose a threat to Hungary despite Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s 2021 demands for NATO to return to its 1997 borders that excludes Hungary and other Central European states from the alliance. &quot;I asked him (Putin) directly whether he had a problem with Hungary&apos;s NATO membership. He said no. Because we don&apos;t have any weapons stationed on our territory that Russia sees as a threat,&quot; Orban said. &quot;He is concerned with long-range tactical weapons. It&apos;s hard to imagine the Hungarians invading Moscow (laughs),&quot; the prime minister added. During the interview with Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Orban once again called for peace talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and said that without them, Ukraine risks becoming &quot;the Afghanistan of the European Union.&quot; Orban&apos;s remarks come amid strained relations between Hungary and the EU. Previously, the European Commission criticized Hungary for failing to meet democratic standards, particularly regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. Hungary will also not receive 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in aid from the EU due to violations of the rule of law. Budapest failed to meet the requirements, and thus lost funding, according to the European Commission.	https://kyivindependent.com/lets-leave-judgment-to-historians-orban-evaded-question-of-whether-he-considers-russia-aggressor-state/	2025-02-03T09:03:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239783290.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank cooperates with companies supplying Russian army, Bloomberg reports	The Russian wing of Raiffeisen Bank International cooperates with companies that supply to the Russian army, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 3. Raiffeisen is the largest Western bank continuing to operate in Russia. Hesitant to fully withdraw from the Russian market, the bank eventually announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; reduce its operations in the country. Over the past year, Raiffeisen in Russia received over 62 million rubles ($620,000) for servicing the Russian chemical company Unichim, that isn&apos;t under sanctions, yet provides sanctioned companies with components to produce military equipment, according to Bloomberg. Raiffeisen Bank cooperated with Unichim by involving accounts in banks such as Sberbank, VTB, Soledarnost (&quot;solidarity&quot; in English), and others under sanctions. Unichim also supplied acids to the Russian company Ravenstvo (&quot;equality&quot; in English) from under sanctioned. The deliveries were made for a project that specialized in developing and modernizing multiple launch rocket systems and aerial bombs. Ravenstvo, which mainly develops radar systems, is a division of the sanctioned Russian concern Granit-Electron, a manufacturer of key elements for missile systems. The company cooperated with the Proletarsky Shipyard, part of Russia&apos;s largest shipbuilder, the United Shipbuilding Corporation. Raiffeisen Bank also handled transactions for TotalElectro, a cable supplier to the Smolensk Aviation Plant, Bloomberg reported. The bank probably has other clients that facilitate supplies to the Russian defense industry, Bloomberg reported. Earlier in September, a Russian court issued a preliminary ruling that banned the transfer of Raiffeisen shares. &quot;This complicates the sales process&quot; and will &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in Raiffeisen&apos;s exit from Russia, the company said. Due to limitations imposed by the Russian government, Raiffeisen cannot transfer these funds to its parent company in Austria, which has led to the accumulation of 4.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of excess capital in Russia, according to Bloomberg. In 2023, the Russian branch of Raiffeisen Bank earned over $1 billion in the first three quarters, which accounted for about 50% of the group&apos;s total profit. The bank also paid 277 million euros ($284 million) in taxes to Russia over the same period, the media outlet added.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-cooperates-with-companies-supplying-russian-army-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-03T08:00:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/reiff.jpg
Romanian presidential candidate says his claims on Ukraine's partition are 'theoretical'	Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu said his recent claims about the partition of Ukraine&apos;s territories were &quot;an absolutely theoretical hypothesis,&quot; Digi24 reported on Feb. 3. Romanian far-right populist Georgescu tried to somewhat walk back on his remarks, days after he called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that Ukraine&apos;s borders can change as a result of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, suggesting Romania could claim some of the country&apos;s territories. Speaking on Romanian television on Feb. 2, Georgescu said that politicians who criticize him for these words are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; &quot;I was talking about a very simple thing, by the way. We have to learn from our historical experience. The world is changing,&quot; Georgescu said. &quot;If we talk about the period of World War II, we made a lot of mistakes, we did not really understand how to position ourselves. And Greater Romania became Little Romania. This is the reality,&quot; he added. Georgescu&apos;s recent comments were also dismissed by Kyiv as revisionist and contrary to international norms, the U.N. Charter, and democratic values. &quot;His attempts to position himself as an &apos;independent&apos; politician look absurd &#x2014; the rhetoric he voiced is identical to Russian propaganda, indicating complete dependence on his masters in Moscow,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. Earlier, similar remarks were made by other Romanian far-right politicians. Claudiu Tarziu, one of the leaders of Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, said his country should &quot;reunite&quot; with Moldova and the Ukrainian border regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Zakarpattia. Zakarpattia Oblast is Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region with significant Hungarian and Romanian ethnic minorities. The historical region of Northern Bukovina is a part of today&apos;s Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast, while Bessarabia covers Moldova and parts of Chernivtsi and Odesa oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-presidential-candidate-says-his/	2025-02-03T07:35:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191257472.jpg
24-year-old Ukrainian pilot killed in action	Ivan Bolotov, a 24-year-old Ukrainian pilot and captain of the 831st Tactical Aviation Brigade, was killed during a combat mission, the brigade said on Feb. 3. &quot;He was only 24, but he was a competent and experienced warrior who mercilessly beat the (Russian forces) on all their approaches and front lines,&quot; the statement read. Captain Bolotov has carried out Air Force flight missions since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to the brigade. According to the media reports, he had a wife and a five-month-old son. Another Ukrainian fighter pilot from the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade was confirmed as killed in combat in December 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/24-year-old-ukrainian-pilot-killed-in-action/	2025-02-03T06:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/--------------2025-02-03-151324.png
Ukraine identifies soldier in severed head photo, documents Russian war crime	Editor&apos;s note: Due to its graphic nature, the editorial team has decided not to publish the footage circulated by Russian sources. Ukraine has preliminarily identified the decapitated Ukrainian service member whose photos were circulated online by Russian sources, said Artur Dobroserdov, the Commissioner for Persons Missing in Special Circumstances, on Feb. 3. The photo shows the severed head of a Ukrainian soldier being held, presumably, by a Russian soldier. The National Police will conduct investigations to clarify the circumstances of the incident, locate the body, and gather further details, Dobroserdov said. &quot;We urge you to refrain from spreading unverified information and trust only official sources of information,&quot; he added. The National Police has been tasked with contacting the soldier&apos;s relatives and investigating the case while Ukrainian authorities are documenting another violation of international humanitarian law by Russia. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office was informed of the incident as part of ongoing efforts to document Russian war crimes. &quot;Each war crime is thoroughly documented, and the relevant information is transmitted to international legal institutions,&quot; Dobroserdov added. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia, including the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers as of mid-December 2024. Cases of Russian forces decapitating Ukrainian troops have also surfaced in June and August 2024. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported a sharp increase in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, with 79 executions recorded in 24 separate incidents since August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-identifies-soldier-in-severed-head-photo-documents-russian-war-crime/	2025-02-03T05:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Ukraine's laser technologies 'already hit certain objects,' commander says	Ukraine is already using laser technologies to hit Russian targets, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. &quot;Laser technologies are already hitting certain objects at a certain altitude,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. The commander first said in mid-December 2024 that Ukraine is among the few nations with laser weapon capabilities. According to Sukharevskyi, Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than a year ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. When asked how successful the development of these technologies has been, Sukharevskyi said that the Ukrainian military&apos;s R&amp;D (Research and Development) &quot;involves a number of areas.&quot; The new system was the result of efforts to find an effective countermeasure against Russian aircraft and drones, specifically Shahed-type attack drones, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these claims. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late January, the Unmanned Systems Forces said that Ukraine deployed a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-using-laser-weapons/	2025-02-03T05:14:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2034676935.jpg
Russia sees Saudi Arabia, UAE as possible venues for Trump-Putin meeting, Reuters reports	Moscow views Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as potential venues for an anticipated meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Reuters reported on Feb. 3, citing two Russian sources. The report follows Trump&apos;s remarks that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia are progressing, though he provided few details. Since his election campaign, the U.S. president has pledged to broker a swift end to the war. Senior Russian officials have allegedly visited both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in recent weeks, according to Reuters. Some Russian diplomats and intelligence officials reportedly oppose the idea, citing the close military and security ties that both countries maintain with the United States. Russian officials have denied any direct contact with the U.S. regarding preparations for a phone call between Putin and Trump, which is expected to occur before an in-person meeting later this year. Trump has previously said he believes Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by refusing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine, adding that Moscow would be better off ending the war. Trump&apos;s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC News on Jan. 12 that Trump and Putin were expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; On Jan. 24, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin was willing to engage in talks with Trump. Moscow has previously rejected key aspects of a peace proposal reportedly floated by Trump&apos;s team, which included freezing the front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers. While Trump has not disclosed specific details about his plan to end the war, his team has indicated that the administration aims to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio nevertheless suggested that Kyiv and Moscow need to make concessions to reach a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sees-saudi-arabia-uae-as-possible-venues-for-trump-putin-meeting-reuters-reports/	2025-02-03T04:48:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Kursk operation, long-range strikes in Russia — Syrskyi outlines Ukraine's priorities	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 named Ukraine&apos;s operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and strikes against military facilities deep inside Russian territory as Kyiv&apos;s key battlefield priorities. &quot;We continue effectively destroying Russia&apos;s military facilities to reduce its strike potential. We are destroying Russian forces both in Ukraine and Russia,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on social media. The commander outlined Ukraine&apos;s key priorities, including holding defensive lines, preventing Russian advances, and enhancing the use of unmanned systems. &quot;On the ground, first of all, we saturate units holding the defenses at the front line with personnel and equipment,&quot; Syrskyi said. He stressed the need to improve recruitment and psychological support for soldiers and better integrate newcomers from training centers before they undertake combat missions. Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone strikes on Russian oil facilities in the past weeks, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and weaken Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s war effort. In Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been holding positions since the start of the cross-border incursion in August 2024, reportedly seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Kyiv seeks to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations. Syrskyi also highlighted the importance of strengthening military training and improving recruitment and psychological support for troops. He also reported progress in reforming the Armed Forces&apos; organizational structure, including a shift to a corps-based system. Syrskyi earlier described Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Despite persistent attacks, Russian forces have not achieved a significant breakthrough, though Ukrainian defenses remain under pressure across multiple sectors. &quot;February will not be easy for our troops, but Russia will also have a hard time. I have assigned tasks to the relevant commands and military authorities,&quot; Syrskyi added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-operation-strikes-on-russian-military-targets-syrskyi-outlines-ukraines-priorities/	2025-02-03T04:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/2023-04-19-20.26.28.jpg
Biden admin's escalation fears, 'chaotic' organization delayed aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. military aid to Ukraine was delayed not only by opposition from congressional Republicans but also by concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict with Russia, Reuters said in its analysis published on Feb. 3. Further complicating deliveries was a chaotic weapons-tracking system in which different branches of the U.S. military reportedly used varying definitions of &quot;delivered,&quot; creating confusion over how much aid reached Ukraine. The most significant delays nevertheless stemmed from months of congressional gridlock in later 2023 and early 2024 over approving $60 billion in additional military assistance, mainly due to Republican resistance, the news agency wrote. Democratic and Republican lawmakers had urged House Speaker Mike Johnson for months to bring the aid package to a vote. Hard-line Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump reportedly pressured Johnson to block further assistance to Kyiv. Even after Congress approved the funding, U.S. military aid to Ukraine remained inconsistent, Reuters reported, citing sources in Washington and Kyiv. By November 2024, Ukraine had received only half of the military aid the U.S. had promised for that year from existing Pentagon stockpiles. According to the analysis, only 30% of the pledged armored vehicles had been delivered by early December. Until September, the Biden administration allocated an average of about $558 million per month to Ukraine. Following Trump&apos;s victory in the presidential election, U.S. military aid surged, reaching levels not seen since mid-2023. Between October 2024 and Biden&apos;s departure from office on Jan. 20, 2025, U.S. assistance averaged $1.1 billion per month &#x2014; matching the pace set during the first two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Reuters&apos; findings are based on analyzing official U.S. spending data, congressional records, and interviews with over 40 U.S. and Ukrainian officials, lawmakers, and congressional aides. During his campaign, Trump suggested that Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bear partial responsibility for Russia&apos;s ongoing war and pledged to negotiate a swift peace deal. Trump has frequently criticized Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and touted his positive relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising concerns that he may pursue a settlement unfavorable to Kyiv. More recently, Trump has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, blaming Putin for failing to end the war and threatening Russia with economic consequences if a peace deal is not reached. The United States is Ukraine&apos;s largest military aid provider that has been supplying billions in security assistance since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Trump administration has been evasive about whether the new U.S. president plans to cut support after taking office.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-admins-fear-of-escalation-chaotic-tracking-system-reportedly-delayed-us-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-03T04:24:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/biden.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike 2 major energy facilities in Russia, Kyiv confirms	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in Volgograd and a gas processing plant in Astrakhan in Russia overnight on Feb. 3, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. The drones, operated by the SBU and the Special Operations Forces, targeted the flare farm, two primary processing units, and two technological units at the Volgograd oil refinery, owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, the source said. The gas condensate processing complex at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant was also reportedly damaged. The facility has halted operations as the fire continues. Both targeted facilities are said to be major fuel producers for the Russian military. The statement comes after Russian authorities reported fires and drone attacks against the Volgograd and Astrakhan oblasts overnight. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff later confirmed that Ukrainian forces were behind the attacks. &quot;The Volgograd oil refinery processes almost 6% of all oil in Russia,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. This is the fifth attack on Russian oil refineries and other facilities in 2025, the source said. Ukrainian drones previously hit the Lukoil-owned oil refinery in Volgograd on Jan. 31. Recent drone strikes also attacked a refinery in Ryazan, a distillery in Tambov Oblast, and a chemical plant in Bryansk. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, later suspended operations due to the damage.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-energy-facilities-kyiv-says/	2025-02-03T04:01:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-03_06-40-42.jpg
UN monitors see 'alarming rise' in executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russia	The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is alarmed over a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, according to a press release obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 3. A total of 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents have been recorded by the mission since the end of August 2024. Presumably, some of these incidents concern group executions. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia during the war. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda that as of mid-December 2024, Kyiv had recorded the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers, with 109 of them last year. The U.N. mission interviewed witnesses and analyzed videos and photos published by Ukrainian and Russian sources showing killings or dead bodies of Ukrainian POWs. The mission also said it had documented the execution of an injured and incapacitated &#x2014; but not yet captured &#x2014; Russian soldier by the Ukrainian army in 2024. Kyiv has not commented on this report. Many Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered or were in the custody of the Russian forces were shot dead on the spot, according to the statement. Unarmed and wounded Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, witnesses said. The reported executions took place in areas where Russian offensive operations were ongoing. According to Danielle Bell, the head of the mission, Russian public figures have explicitly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of captured Ukrainian soldiers, with at least three such appeals recorded by the mission along with social media posts made by Russian military-linked groups. &quot;These incidents did not occur in a vacuum,&quot; Bell said. &quot;All allegations of execution of captured Ukrainian military personnel and public statements calling for, or condoning, such actions must be investigated.&quot; The statement that &quot;no quarter&quot; will be given is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime, according to the statement.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-mission-records-pow-executions/	2025-02-03T03:21:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1960109268-1.jpg
Pro-Russian collaborator Sarkisyan dies in hospital after Moscow explosion, media reports	Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian collaborator from Donetsk Oblast wanted by Ukraine, died in the hospital after being injured in an explosion in an elite residential complex in Moscow on Feb. 3, the state news agency TASS reported, citing healthcare officials. Sarkisyan was severely injured when an unidentified explosive device went off in the lobby of one of the buildings in the&quot;Alye Parusa&quot; (Scarlet Sails) residential complex in northwestern Moscow. The collaborator was initially reported killed, but the Russian media later clarified he was transported to the hospital and had to undergo a leg amputation. Other Russian outlets, including the Interfax news agency, have since reported that Sarkisyan had died in the hospital. Sarkisyan was a crime boss and a close former associate of Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin ex-President Viktor Yanukovych and has been on the international wanted list since 2014 for organizing murders in central Kyiv, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. During the EuroMaidan Revolution, Sarkisyan reportedly organized the hired pro-government thugs (&quot;titushky&quot;) who harrassed pro-EuroMaidan protesters. After the full-scale war broke out, Sarkisyan founded the &quot;Arbat&quot; Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion fighting against Ukraine. The unit is reportedly made up of ethnic Armenians, many of whom have criminal records. Russian law enforcement services suspect that Sarkisyan was a victim of a planned assassination, TASS reported. The explosion reportedly occurred when Sarkisyan and his security guards were entering the building. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. It is currently unclear who was behind the explosion.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-collaborator-sarkisyan-dies-in-hospital-after-moscow-explosion-media-reports/	2025-02-03T02:53:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Sarkiysan.png
Ukraine foils Russian-backed plot to blow up Rivne Oblast railway, SBU says	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 3 that it had prevented a sabotage attempt on a railway in Rivne Oblast, arresting a 23-year-old man allegedly working for Russian intelligence services. &quot;The man, on the instructions of the Russian intelligence services, came to the city of Sarny to blow up the railway tracks of the junction station through which trains with military equipment for the Armed Forces pass,&quot; the SBU said in a statement. The suspect was detained near the tracks while attempting to place explosives intended for remote detonation. Investigators learned that he was also tasked with gathering intelligence on military facilities in Lviv Oblast, according to the SBU. The SBU noted that the man had previously expressed pro-Russian views on social media and wanted to move to Russia. He had previously been prosecuted for desecrating Ukrainian soldiers&apos; graves and was reportedly recruited by Russia due to his ideology. The man has been charged with high treason and sabotage under martial law, offenses punishable by life imprisonment and confiscation of property. The arrest comes days after the SBU dismantled a Russian spy network on Jan. 28 that was gathering intelligence on Ukrainian aircraft and aviation infrastructure for potential strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-foils-russian-backed-sabotage-attempt-on-rivne-railway-security-service-reports/	2025-02-03T02:25:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/740a0900034e4c50e179738c2bd0a5a4.jpg
Syrskyi condemns recent violence against draft officers, calls for investigation	Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 condemned recent violent attacks against enlistment officers, calling for a full investigation and punishment of the perpetrators. &quot;In a short time, unfortunately, three shameful acts of violence occurred in different regions, in which servicemen were injured,&quot; Syrskyi said. In Poltava Oblast, a draft officer was shot dead overnight on Jan. 31 while escorting conscripts to the 199th training center. The alleged perpetrator was detained soon after. In Rivne, an explosive device detonated by an unknown attacker on Feb. 1 injured several service members, leaving one in serious condition. Another explosion on Feb. 2 in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, lightly wounded a service member. &quot;We expect a full and comprehensive investigation of these crimes. The perpetrators must be brought to justice,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine has faced significant challenges in mobilizing troops to compensate for losses and rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Corruption schemes to avoid service have further complicated recruitment efforts. Syrskyi acknowledged ongoing issues with the enlistment but emphasized the importance of public support for the military. &quot;The national defense of Ukraine is impossible without public support for the army and respect for the military,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-condemns-violence-against-recruitment-centers-calls-for-investigation/	2025-02-03T01:51:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Syrskyi.jpg
It's beyond repair' — Musk aims to shut down USAID, claims Trump's backing	Elon Musk said on Feb. 3 that he discussed closing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with President Donald Trump, who allegedly agreed to shut it down. Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted the USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. The agency funds initiatives ranging from women&apos;s health in conflict zones and clean water access to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. &quot;With regards to the USAID stuff, I went over it with (the president) in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,&quot; Musk said during a conversation on X Spaces. Separately, Trump said that the agency is run by &quot;radical lunatics&quot; who need to be removed before the White House makes a final decision on the agency. Earlier reports suggested that the Trump administration aims to move the Congress-funded independent agency under the State Department. USAID&apos;s website has been offline since Feb. 2, signaling the agency&apos;s potential dissolution. &quot;What we have is just a ball of worms. You&apos;ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It&apos;s beyond repair,&quot; Musk added. Musk&apos;s comments follow reports that DOGE representatives accessed USAID&apos;s headquarters in Washington and gained entry to classified areas and data. Trump&apos;s administration reportedly placed two top USAID security officials on leave over the weekend after they attempted to block Musk&apos;s team from restricted areas. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. This funding has helped rebuild schools, finance bomb shelters, and equip hospitals with advanced medical equipment. Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee has begun consultations with European counterparts on temporarily replacing U.S. funding provided through USAID.	https://kyivindependent.com/usaid-faces-shutdown-push-as-musk-claims-trumps-backing/	2025-02-03T01:45:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176083179.jpg
Ukraine needs more than a leadership shake-up to fight financial crime	The recent shake-up at the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine (SFMS), responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, has drawn mixed reactions. Some see it as a step toward fighting corruption and financial crime, while others view the changes with caution, uncertain about the motivations behind the overhaul. But personnel changes, however symbolic, aren&#x2019;t the answer to systemic problems. Ukraine&#x2019;s financial system faces deeper challenges: an underutilized public-private partnership model, a gaping regulatory void in the virtual asset space, and a lack of clarity and capacity in financial investigations. Tackling these issues demands urgent, structural reforms &#x2014; not just new faces at the top. The situation is critical, with far-reaching consequences for Ukraine&apos;s future. As billions in international aid flow in and Ukraine pushes closer to European Union accession, the country&#x2019;s financial integrity has become a litmus test for both international trust and domestic accountability. This is Ukraine&#x2019;s moment to demonstrate its strength &#x2014; not only as a recipient of global support but as a reliable partner in the fight against financial crime. Globally, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as one of the most effective tools in fighting financial crime. PPPs involve collaboration between public institutions and private companies (in this case, financial institutions) to enhance information sharing, risk assessment, and coordinated action. The benefits of such cooperation are clear &#x2014; from Australia&#x2019;s rapid takedown of a multimillion-dollar laundering syndicate to Singapore&#x2019;s real-time financial crime collaboration platform. Ukraine, however, has yet to fully tap into this potential. The Center for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI, in collaboration with Ukraine-based Center for Financial Integrity (CFI), evaluated the current status of these initiatives in its first task force report, &#x201C;PPPs and Fighting Financial Crime in Ukraine.&#x201D; Private financial institutions, from banks to payment processors, possess the data, technology, and on-the-ground insight that could transform Ukraine&#x2019;s anti-money laundering efforts. Yet trust deficits and weak information-sharing mechanisms have stymied meaningful cooperation. To bridge this divide, Ukraine must go beyond ad hoc councils and discussions. Establishing a secure, real-time platform for collaboration &#x2014; focused on high-risk areas like monitoring cryptocurrency transactions or tracking suspicious cross-border payments &#x2014; would be a powerful first step. As trust builds, targeted pilot programs can pave the way for broader systemic change. A new era calls for deeper collaboration with businesses, the IT industry, and fintech companies to revolutionize the fight against financial crime. A woman withdraws money from an ATM in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Ed Ram/Getty Images)Cryptocurrency was a lifeline for Ukraine during the first days of the war, enabling rapid international donations when traditional systems were too slow or rigid. Yet this success story comes with risks. Without clear regulations, virtual assets have also become a conduit for illicit financial flows. Despite two competing draft laws sitting in parliament since 2023, the sector remains largely unregulated, leaving Ukraine vulnerable. The solution is straightforward but requires political will. Ukraine must pass legislation designating a regulator, such as the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, to oversee virtual asset service providers (VASPs). A registry of these providers &#x2014; backed by compliance incentives and penalties &#x2014; should be implemented. Beyond legislation, Ukraine must conduct risk assessments of virtual asset flows, particularly in cross-border transactions. Regulatory sandboxes, where new technologies can be tested under supervision, could also foster innovation while maintaining oversight. The lack of clear regulatory oversight over virtual assets opens the door for Russia to weaponize cryptocurrency, using it to evade sanctions and mine bitcoins in gray zones. Addressing this issue is no longer solely about the financial system &#x2014; it&#x2019;s an integral part of national security. Financial investigations are the backbone of any effective anti-money laundering regime. Yet in Ukraine, they remain disjointed and inconsistent. Agencies lack not only the tools but also the clear roles and responsibilities necessary to act decisively. As a result, critical investigations stall or fail to deliver meaningful outcomes. To address this, Ukraine needs a foundational overhaul of its approach to financial investigations. First, the government should establish clear guidelines outlining the roles of each agency involved. Second, it should invest in capacity-building, providing investigators with advanced analytical tools and targeted training. A focus on parallel financial investigations &#x2014; where financial aspects of crimes are pursued alongside criminal probes &#x2014; would also strengthen outcomes. Finally, closer collaboration with international law enforcement could offer both technical expertise and moral support during this transformative period. Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime circumstances have understandably led to restrictions on access to public financial data, but these measures must remain temporary. Civil society and oversight bodies, both domestic and international, need access to this information to ensure accountability. Without transparency, Ukraine risks undermining its credibility at a time when trust is its most valuable currency. Many state registries have resumed operations, though access to certain data remains restricted to safeguard sensitive information. By balancing security with transparency, Ukraine could signal a commitment to accountability and allow citizens and allies alike to see its progress firsthand. Equally important, Ukraine must ensure that financial investigations lead to real-world consequences: convictions, asset recoveries, and a deterrent effect that criminals can&#x2019;t ignore. The number of convictions in money laundering cases remains disappointingly low, as does the success rate of asset recovery &#x2014; something the global financial crime watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, is likely to view negatively in any upcoming evaluation. Leadership changes at the SFMS are not unimportant, but they are no substitute for meaningful reform. If Ukraine wants to be seen as a reliable partner &#x2014; not just a recipient of aid &#x2014; it must take bold, decisive action. Though the steps to address these challenges are clear, their execution demands political will and coordination. Ukraine must harness the power of public-private collaboration, close regulatory gaps in virtual assets, and build capacity for financial investigations. This moment presents a rare chance for meaningful change. With the world&#x2019;s eyes on its struggle for sovereignty and stability, real reform would send an unmistakable message: Ukraine is not just surviving but leading by example &#x2014; leaping forward with significant societal reforms, including in the fight against financial crime.

Explosion rocks Moscow residential complex, casualties reported	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An explosion occurred in the lobby of the &quot;Alye Parusa&quot; residential complex in northwestern Moscow on Feb. 3, the state news agency TASS reported, citing emergency services. At least one person was killed and four injured, the Russian media reported. The injured victims reportedly include the security guards of the man killed in the blast. Citing sources, the pro-state outlet Kommersant identified the victim as Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian collaborator from Donetsk Oblast wanted by Ukraine.

The explosion occurred when one of the building&apos;s residents &#x2014; the man killed in the blast &#x2014; entered the entrance with his security guards, the Russian Telegram channel 112 claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-rocks-moscow-residential-complex-casualties-reported/	2025-02-03T00:07:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247556676.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 3. Russia launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones overnight, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 38 drones, while 25 others were lost in the airspace without causing damage. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and wounded 13 others, including two children, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russian forces also killed one resident of Donetsk Oblast in Myrnohrad. Another five people were wounded in the oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 39-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man were injured in a drone attack and suffered first and second-degree burns, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 70-year-old man was wounded in an attack on the Synelnykove district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and is in moderate condition, Governor Serhii Lysak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-5/	2025-02-02T23:50:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-02_17-23-58.jpg
Key Russian, North Korean officers killed in Ukraine's strike on Kursk Oblast command post, Zelensky says	A Ukrainian strike on a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast killed dozens of Russian and North Korean officers, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Associated Press on Feb. 2. &quot;There was a strong operation by our military &#x2014; they hit their central command post in the Kursk direction. And they lost key officers of Russia and North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview. The strike, allegedly conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Missile and Artillery Forces on Jan. 31, targeted the command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the city of Rylsk. &quot;It was our military target, a fair one. There was a missile attack from our side and various types of weapons; a complex attack was launched against them,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also claimed that Russia had deployed around 12,000 North Korean troops to Kursk Oblast, of whom more than 4,000 &quot;had been lost.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;They lost the combat capability of this first package of North Koreans. I can&apos;t call them anything else because it&apos;s a package &#x2014; they don&apos;t know where they&apos;re going, and they&apos;re fighting against a country they&apos;ve never been to,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August 2024, allegedly seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of that area, the fighting continues. Kyiv hopes to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to the area to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion. North Korean troops have not been seen in the areas where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces are fighting for roughly three weeks, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment came as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front lines after suffering heavy casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-strike-on-russian-command-post-kills-key-russian-north-korean-officers/	2025-02-02T22:54:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Ukraine's drones reportedly strike Russian energy facilities in Astrakhan, Volgograd oblasts	Ukrainian drones attacked energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires, according to local authorities. The news comes as Ukraine ramps up long-range strikes against Russian energy infrastructure to stifle Moscow&apos;s gas and oil exports that fuel its war chest. Russian air defenses &quot;repelled a massive attack against Volgograd Oblast,&quot; Governor Andrei Bocharov claimed. &quot;Most of the drones were intercepted and neutralized. There were no casualties. Fallen debris caused fires on the territory of a local oil refinery,&quot; the governor said in a statement, reporting short-term voltage drops in the power grid. Volgograd residents reported at least 50 explosions during the night, with almost all of the drones intercepted over the local Lukoil oil refinery, the Russian Telegram channel Baza reported. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage allegedly showing a Ukrainian drone attack against Volgograd Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 3, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko/Telegram)The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine and was previously targeted by Ukrainian drones on Jan. 31. In Astrakhan Oblast, air defenses and electronic warfare systems were deployed to intercept drones attacking fuel and energy facilities, Governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;A fire broke out after a crash of one of the drones,&quot; Babushkin said on his Telegram channel without specifying the exact location of the fire while reporting no casualties. Baza claimed that the fire broke out at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage allegedly showing a Ukrainian drone attack against the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant in Astrakhan Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 3, 2025.

Astrakhan Oblast is located in southwestern Russia on the Caspian Sea coast and borders Kazakhstan. The city of Astrakhan is almost 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Russian air defenses intercepted 70 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over Rostov Oblast, 25 over Volgograd Oblast, seven over Astrakhan Oblast, five over Voronezh Oblast, four over Belgord Oblast, and two over Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-drones-reportedly-strike-russian-energy-facilities-in-astrakhan-volgograd-oblasts/	2025-02-02T22:41:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-03_06-40-42.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 841,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 841,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 3. This number includes 1,300 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,920 tanks, 20,685 armored fighting vehicles, 35,798 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,589 artillery systems, 1,268 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,053 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,911 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-841-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-02T22:11:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/img-0974-1655999300w0hvt.jpg
EU leaders to discuss defense strategy against Russia, Trump’s tariffs	European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels on Feb. 3 to address the continent&#x2019;s defense strategy against Russia and to navigate the challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent tariff decisions targeting Canada, Mexico, and China. The leaders of the EU&#x2019;s 27 member states will convene at a former royal palace turned conference center, where they will be joined for lunch by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and later dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, according to Reuters. Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, has framed the gathering as a &quot;retreat&quot; rather than a formal summit, aiming to foster open discussions without official declarations or binding decisions. A key focus of the meeting is geopolitics and EU relations with the United States, with Trump&#x2019;s sweeping tariffs expected to dominate the agenda. EU officials are increasingly concerned that similar measures could soon be imposed on European exports. Additionally, Trump&#x2019;s demands for increased European defense spending and reduced reliance on NATO will be a major topic, particularly as he has called for EU member Denmark to relinquish Greenland to the U.S., further straining transatlantic relations. Costa emphasized the need for Europe to enhance its defense capabilities, adding in a letter to EU leaders that &quot;Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense. It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous, and a more reliable security and defense actor.&quot; While countries like France and the Baltic states support joint EU borrowing for defense spending, Germany and the Netherlands remain opposed. A potential compromise could involve borrowing to finance loans rather than direct grants for defense projects, Reuters reports. European defense spending has risen significantly since Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, EU nations collectively spent an estimated 326 billion euros ($334.48 billion) on defense, an increase of 30% from 2021. Despite this, Trump has pushed for NATO&#x2019;s European members to allocate 5% of GDP to defense, a target that no member, including the U.S., currently meets.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-to-discuss-defense-strategy-against-russia-trumps-tariffs/	2025-02-02T21:39:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg
Ukrainian FM calls Putin’s remarks on Zelensky’s legitimacy 'absurd'	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s claims about President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, calling them &quot;absurd.&quot; &quot;Putin&apos;s remarks about the legitimacy of Ukraine&apos;s President are absurd. During his quarter-century stay in the Kremlin, Ukraine saw three presidents change in fair elections; President Trump returned for a second term after an impressive victory. This is democracy and legitimacy,&quot; Sybiha wrote in a post on X on &#xA0;Feb. 2. Putin has reiterated his claim that Zelensky is &quot;illegitimate&quot; and said that he has no right to sign any documents in potential peace negotiations, according to an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya 1 broadcast on Jan. 28. Russia has frequently promoted the narrative that Zelensky is illegitimate as part of its propaganda campaign to undermine the Ukrainian government. However, leading Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts assert that this claim is baseless and without merit. Sybiha further criticized Putin for consolidating power by dismantling Russia&#x2019;s constitution, suppressing opposition, shutting down independent media, and staging sham elections to remain in office for longer than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. &quot;Now this person is lecturing the world on legitimacy. Give us a break,&quot; he added. According to Sybiha, Putin&#x2019;s statements are deliberate attempts to mislead foreign leaders and audiences. &quot;Only fools can trust them. If anyone&apos;s legitimacy is called into question, it is that of Moscow&apos;s dictator, who creates cannon fodder from men in their twenties born while he was already in power,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-calls-putins-remarks-on-zelenskys-legitimacy-absurd/	2025-02-02T20:41:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg
Trump says talks with Ukraine, Russia 'going pretty well,' media reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia are making progress, though he provided few details. &quot;We have meetings and talks scheduled with various parties, including Ukraine and Russia. And I think those discussions are actually going pretty well,&quot; Trump told reporters late on Feb. 2. Earlier in the day, Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, suggested that both nations would need to make concessions to negotiate an end to the war. &quot;President Volodymyr Zelensky has already indicated he will soften his position on land,&quot; Kellogg reportedly said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;And [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is going to have to soften his positions as well.&quot; He added that discussions would continue in the near future, calling negotiations &quot;good for both sides.&quot; Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. However, as Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine remains uncertain. Kellogg noted that the previous administration provided $174 billion in assistance, a figure Trump has frequently criticized. Meanwhile, Russia has sustained heavy battlefield losses and continues to face economic strain due to military spending and Western sanctions. Trump has promised to end the war swiftly but has not disclosed any specific plans. On Jan. 31, Kellogg claimed the former president had a &quot;solid&quot; strategy to end the war within months.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-talks-with-ukraine-russia-going-pretty-well-media-reports/	2025-02-02T19:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Zelensky warns of Russia’s growing alliance with Iran, North Korea	President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Russia has officially strengthened its alliance with Iran and North Korea, posing a direct threat to the United States. In an interview with the Associated Press on Feb. 2, Zelensky added that while these countries had previously cooperated on weapons and technology, they are now openly engaged in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &quot;For the first time in decades, Russia has officially demonstrated its alliance by involving Iran and North Korea. Yes, they had relations before, exchanging technology, weapons, and so on, but now they have actively brought them into the war. Iran is supplying weapons, North Korea is providing both weapons and troops,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(...) As of today, North Korea, Russia, and Iran form a concrete alliance against Ukraine and the entire West. I believe this is, in fact, an alliance against the United States. This is a very dangerous alliance.&quot; He emphasized that the three nations have deepened their military cooperation, effectively merging their defense industries to ramp up weapons production. &quot;These three countries, aside from being nuclear powers, are highly escalatory states, and they are certainly not about peace. They are now united, they are strategic partners. They have effectively merged their defense industries, and they will continue to expand and increase weapons production,&quot; he warned. Zelensky also raised concerns about North Korean troops stationed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, saying they are gaining combat experience that could be used in future conflicts elsewhere. &quot;This is happening now, and it is very dangerous for the United States and for many countries in that region,&quot; he said. Earlier reports indicated that North Korean troops in the Kursk region had been undergoing rotations due to heavy losses. However, Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces recently reported that no North Korean presence had been detected in the region for about three weeks.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russias-growing-alliance-with-iran-north-korea/	2025-02-02T18:52:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Trump administration removes more USAID staff as agency faces uncertain future, CNN reports	The Trump administration removed two top security officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) over the weekend after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&#x2019;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing restricted areas, CNN reports. The removals are part of a broader effort by Trump&#x2019;s team to strip USAID of its independence. Nearly 100 senior career staff members have been placed on leave as discussions continue about shifting the agency under State Department control. A senior Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that DOGE personnel entered USAID headquarters without security clearances and were initially turned away by agency security officers. However, the officers were allegedly threatened with action by the federal Marshals Service. Shortly afterward, USAID&#x2019;s security director, John Voorhees, and his deputy were removed from their positions. DOGE officials accessed offices containing classified materials and personal data, though it remains unclear what information was obtained. In response, DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller said on social media that &quot;no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.&quot; The shake-up has raised legal concerns, with congressional Democrats warning that dismantling USAID&#x2019;s independence could violate U.S. law. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jeanne Shaheen has formally requested an explanation from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast voiced support for placing USAID under State Department oversight: &quot;There needs to be more command and control,&quot; according to Reuters. The agency&#x2019;s website has been offline since Feb. 2 afternoon, a sign that USAID could be nearing its dissolution. The agency&#x2019;s funding supports initiatives ranging from women&#x2019;s health in conflict zones and access to clean water to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has played a vital role in supporting the country. The agency has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. This funding has helped rebuild schools damaged by Russian attacks, finance bomb shelters, and supply hospitals with advanced medical equipment. Billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead a federal cost-cutting panel, has ramped up his attacks on USAID, calling it &quot;a criminal organization&quot; on his social media platform X and declaring that it is &quot;Time for it to die.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-removes-more-usaid-staff-as-agency-faces-uncertain-future-cnn-reports/	2025-02-02T16:56:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172231465.jpg
Russia used US banks to send billions to Turkey, dodging sanctions, WSJ reports	A U.S. Justice Department investigation found that Russia funneled billions of dollars through American banks to Turkey in 2022, using the Akkuyu nuclear power plant project as cover to evade sanctions, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup facilitated more than $5 billion in transfers linked to the Russian-backed project, with at least $2 billion later frozen by U.S. authorities. The Justice Department suspects the scheme was orchestrated at the highest levels in Moscow, with the Bank of Russia secretly funding a $9 billion loan through Gazprombank. This allowed Russian money to flow into Turkey while avoiding direct transactions with sanctioned entities. Officials believe the transfers were designed not just for nuclear construction but also to create an offshore dollar reserve for Russian state initiatives. Despite prosecutors&#x2019; efforts to seize the frozen funds in 2024, the Biden administration halted the case, fearing diplomatic fallout with Turkey, a NATO ally. The White House and State Department worried legal action could strain cooperation on prisoner exchanges, counterterrorism, and Middle East stability. A key concern was the suspected involvement of Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin and former finance minister Nureddin Nebati in facilitating the payments. Turkey, unlike other NATO members, has refused to impose sanctions on Russia and has expanded trade with Moscow while simultaneously providing weapons to Ukraine. The country&#x2019;s financial system benefited from the Russian transfers as the Turkish central bank sought to stabilize the lira amid inflation. With the case now on hold, the Trump administration must decide whether to pursue action. During his first term, tensions flared between Washington and Ankara over sanctions violations involving Turkey&#x2019;s state-owned Halkbank.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-us-banks-to-send-billions-to-turkey-dodging-sanctions-wsj-reports/	2025-02-02T15:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1028370860-1.jpg
Russian vice-governor and military commander killed in Kursk Oblast, Astra reports	Sergei Yefremov, Vice-Governor of Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai and commander of the Tiger military unit, was killed in Kursk Oblast, Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported on Feb. 2. According to reports from another Russian channel Mash, Yefremov&#x2019;s vehicle struck a mine and exploded, killing him and another officer. &quot;While returning from a combat mission, Sergei Yefremov, the commander of the Tiger unit, was killed,&quot; Primorsky Krai Governor Oleg Kozhemyako said. The Tiger volunteer unit was formed in 2022, and Yefremov took command of it in Aug. 2024. Following his new appointment, his unit was deployed to Kursk Oblast. Kyiv&apos;s limited incursion into Kursk Oblast began on Aug. 6, 2024, when Ukrainian forces temporarily captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. Ukraine hopes to leverage its presence in the area in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-vice-governor-and-military-commander-killed-in-kursk-oblast-astra-reports/	2025-02-02T13:54:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/efremov.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Poland scrambles jets, puts air defense on high alert during Russian missile attack on Ukraine	Key developments on Feb. 1-2: Polish and other allied aircraft were quickly mobilized on Feb. 1 in response to a large-scale missile attack by Russia on western Ukraine, Poland&apos;s Armed Forces reported on X. &quot;Attention, due to the attack of the Russian Federation performing strikes on facilities located in the west of Ukraine, among others, the operation of Polish and allied aviation in our airspace has begun,&#x201D; the statement said. All available forces and means were activated during the attack, the command said, adding that it was constantly monitoring the situation. In accordance with procedures, fighter jets were dispatched, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance assets were put on high alert, the Polish military said. Russia launched a combined attack of 165 &#xA0;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles at Ukraine overnight and in the morning on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defense intercepted 56 Russian UAVs, the Air Force said. At least seven people were killed and 14 injured in a residential building strike in Poltava. Civilian enterprises and infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky, and Kyiv oblasts were damaged, according to the report. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year. Russia is building a new naval base in Ochamchire, Abkhazia, a move that raises fears Georgia could be drawn into the war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports. The base is part of Moscow&#x2019;s strategy to safeguard its naval forces after suffering heavy losses in the Black Sea. Since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has lost or sustained damage to roughly a third of its fleet in the region. Satellite images obtained by the outlet show continued upgrades at the Ochamchira port, including expanded access points to fit larger vessels. Though relatively small, experts say the facility could host ships equipped with cruise missiles, bolstering Russia&#x2019;s military presence in the Black Sea. Ochamchire, more than 700 kilometers southeast of the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, could provide Moscow with a naval base that remains largely beyond the range of Ukraine&#x2019;s existing long-range strikes. Russia has occupied Abkhazia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. The region is internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil. The Wall Street Journal reports that if Ukraine were to target Russian warships there, Georgia could find itself pulled into the war. Beyond military risks, the base threatens a key trade route between Asia and Europe. Before Russia&#x2019;s invasion, more than 85% of land-based trade between China and Europe moved through Russian territory. Sanctions have disrupted that route, shifting attention to the Middle Corridor, which runs through Georgia. The World Bank estimates this corridor could handle 11 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030, up from less than 3 million tonnes in 2023. A large-scale fire broke out at a warehouse in Kharkiv after a Russian drone struck a civilian enterprise late at night on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Russia launched a drone attack against the city&apos;s Slobidskyi district, causing a massive fire in a production and warehouse facility. The fire spread over an area of 2,000 meters, the State Emergency Service said. Firefighters contained the blaze at 1:27 a.m. local time on Feb. 2. The warehouse was part of a civilian enterprise, according to authorities. No casualties have been reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure with missiles, drones, and glide bombs. Some 15,000 Russian soldiers were &quot;neutralized&quot; by Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast during January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 2. In a post on Facebook that included a video of combat footage, Syrskyi said the area &quot;remains one of the hottest&quot; on the front, adding Ukrainian forces were &quot;continuously inflicting losses on the occupiers.&quot; &quot;In January of this year alone, our soldiers neutralized more than 15,000 invaders here, of which about 7,000 were killed,&quot; he added. 0:00/0:541&#xD7;The video released by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 2 of combat in the Pokrovsk sector (Facebook) The Kyiv Independent could not verify the figures. A report from the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28 said that overall across the front lines, the intensity of Russian assaults was declining, but remains high. It added that Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces were deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the sector, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27. The peak intensity of Russian offensive efforts across the front lines was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot; Five people, among them two children, were injured after Russia targeted a minibus with a drone, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Feb. 2. A 12 year-old boy and a 13 year-old girl, along with three adult women, have been diagnosed with concussions after the attack. &quot;All the victims have been taken to medical facilities, where doctors are providing them with the necessary assistance,&quot; Prokudin wrote. Kherson Oblast remains under partial Russian occupation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. The region, including the city of Kherson, is frequently targeted by Russian forces, with regular attacks resulting in civilian casualties. Drone attacks targeting civilians in the southern city of Kherson have become so frequent that locals speaking to the Kyiv Independent last year &#xA0;described the violent campaign as a &quot;human safari.&quot; Under international law, the intentional targeting of civilians who are not actively engaged in hostilities during wartime constitutes a war crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-poland-scrambles-jets-puts-air-defense-on-high-alert-during-russian-missile-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-02-02T12:29:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/fire.jpg
Multiple Georgian opposition leaders arrested as pro-EU demonstrators block highway in Tbilisi	Georgian police arrested two opposition leaders, including the former mayor of Tbilisi, during a street protest against the ruling Georgian Dream party, Echo of the Caucasus reported on Feb. 2. Along with former Tbilisi Mayor Gigi Ugulava, the leader of EU-friendly party &#x201C;Akhali&#x201D; Nika Melia was arrested as well. Both Melia and Ugulava had previously been imprisoned under the current government on charges widely criticized as politically motivated. The arrests took place as thousands of demonstrators attempted to block a major highway leading into Tbilisi, near the capital&#x2019;s main shopping center. Authorities warned that blocking the highway was a criminal offense, citing a recent legislative amendment on January 31 that added &quot;roads of international and domestic importance&quot; to the list of strategic objects. Officials stated that the protest near Tbilisi Mall fell under Article 222 of the Criminal Code, which carries penalties ranging from correctional labor to up to two years in prison. Several other protesters were also detained, with at least one reported injury. &quot;Fire to the oligarchy,&#x201D; &quot;No justice - no peace&quot;, the protestors chanted. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. Hundreds of protestors have been arrested since the fall, and numerous cases have been reported of Georgian police using tactics such as tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrations.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-georgian-opposition-leaders-arrested-as-pro-eu-demonstrators-block-highway-in-tbilisi/	2025-02-02T11:23:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg
Zelensky comments on Defense Procurement Agency dispute, says Umerov is entitled to make any decisions to prevent military supply delays	President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the conflict between the Defense Ministry and the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) on Feb. 2 in an interview with the Associated Press (AP), commenting that the Defense Minister has the right to do everything to ensure that there is no slowdown in supplies. &quot;We have a Defense Minister who clearly understands that, God forbid, there will be any interruptions somewhere from anyone in supporting our military: from drones to air defense, there will be not only military losses, there will be civilian losses, children will suffer, there will be more strikes, Russia will be stronger,&#x201D; Zelensky told AP. He also warned that if there were institutional problems affecting contracts or deliveries, immediate action was necessary to prevent interruptions. Zelensky emphasized that there should be no pauses in supply of artillery packages. &#x201C;Therefore, the Defense Minister has the right to do everything to ensure that there is no slowdown in supplies. Today, all of our money is in the Defense Ministry, in our army. And if there is money there, and some delivery has not come, then, frankly, he must do everything to prevent such problems from happening again... And he is doing it,&#x201D; Zelensky concluded. The dispute arose after the Defense Procurement Agency&#x2019;s head, Maryna Bezrukova, was suspended by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, despite her contract being extended. Arsen Zhumadilov was appointed as acting head. The Defense Ministry cited several reasons for her removal, including alleged failure to fulfill planned deliveries for the front, poor procurement planning and delays, lack of timely communication with the General Staff, and leaks of classified information, which are reportedly expected to be investigated. Umerov&apos;s decision to fire Bezrukova sparked backlash, as Ukrainian law grants supervisory boards the sole authority to appoint or dismiss state enterprise heads. The Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-comments-on-defense-procurement-agency-dispute-says-umerov-is-entitled-to-make-any-decisions-to-prevent-military-supply-delays/	2025-02-02T10:06:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/ZelenskySyrskyi.jpg
Russia’s ‘appalling’ response to oil tanker crash caused ‘ecological catastrophe’ in Black Sea	On the night of Dec. 15, 2024, two Russian oil tankers, Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, sank in the Kerch Strait, a narrow maritime connection between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, off the coast of occupied Crimea. Both vessels were constructed for service on rivers, not on the open sea, and did not have valid sailing documents at the time of the disaster. The tankers also violated a weather-based ban on entering the Kerch Strait. The vessel crews then attempted for days to obtain an authorization to discharge their oil at a nearby port on the coast of Crimea. To no avail. A storm picked up, with waves reaching three meters. This brought an end to the service of Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, which had been in use since 1969 and 1973, respectively. While on Jan. 25, the Russian government officially declared that emergency services had finished an ongoing oil extraction operation, this only concerned one part of Volgoneft-239, which eventually drifted to the coast of Crimea following the wreckage. The remaining parts of this vessel, and all of Volgoneft-212, are currently only being &#x201C;examined underwater,&#x201D; with no attempts yet being made to haul them to shore or extract the fuel oil left in their reservoirs. According to Eugene Simonov, an expert with the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Work Group (UWEC) who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the sunken vessel parts are left untouched because Russian authorities simply do not have the appropriate equipment to extract oil from underwater reservoirs. As a result, according to Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the head of science at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Volgoneft wreckages could evolve into the &#x201C;worst ecological catastrophe&#x201D; Russia has seen in the 21st century. While oil spills have already occurred in the region in the past, the December incident surpasses anything the Black Sea has ever seen. In the closest comparable case, 1,300 tons of fuel oil were released in November 2007, also after a Russian tanker sank in the Kerch Strait. As for the most recent wreckage, estimates by Russian state-aligned media put the amount of fuel oil released at 3,700 tons. In late January, the fuel oil reached Ukraine&#x2019;s Odesa Oblast, with Ukrainian emergency services now also tasked with cleaning up the shores. According to Russian environmental experts, the seabed and the shores of Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai will be especially affected by the spill. Much of this is due to the type of fuel which was spilt. The Volgoneft tankers carried &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil, known as Mazut, which typically conglomerates into solid lumps that are heavier than water. As a result, the lumps sink and cannot be easily localized, which makes cleanup operations more difficult. Some lumps of &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil sink, covering the seabed and squashing life beneath. Others eventually wash up on nearby coasts, polluting shoreline waters and beaches. In comparison, so-called &#x201C;light&#x201D; oil typically floats at the surface, spreading in black pools. While the immediate effects of such a spill can be more drastic, cleanup operations are more straightforward.

(Stringer/AFP via Getty Images)In the case of &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil, lumps can continue washing up on shorelines for months. Some of those that sink remain there until they are dissolved by microorganisms, which can take years if not decades. According to Natalia Gozak, director of Greenpeace Ukraine, the Black Sea is currently going through its peak of immediate contamination. While this wave might be over soon, the released fuel oil will now move along the maritime food chain, making fish and other wildlife in the sea unsuitable for consumption. In total, the Black Sea might need 10 to 12 years to rid itself from the oil spill, Gozak told the Kyiv Independent. Regardless of this, Russian public health officials were quick to claim that fish from the Black Sea was safe to eat, even if it came from affected areas. Certain types of fish are, however, already becoming difficult to find on sale in the Krasnodar Krai, Russian media reported. According to a Russian ecologist and oil spill expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on conditions of anonymity, the reaction by Russian authorities was in fact &#x201C;appalling.&#x201D; Actions taken in the first days following such disasters are crucial, and in the case of the Black Sea oil spill, authorities &#x201C;hardly reacted at all&#x201D; within this time frame. Authorities only started reacting after the disaster went viral on Russian social media, the expert said. &#x201C;Normally, in all countries, there are protocols for what to do in such situations. In Russia, there are also such plans for oil spills, and legislation is highly developed. However, the issue is that these plans and legislation were not applied.&#x201D; In the first weeks, Russian authorities &#x201C;acted without any plan&#x201D; to manage the effects of the disaster, according to Simonov. &#x201C;The main instinct of the responsible officials was rather classic: to hide from higher-up (authorities) their inability to manage the consequences of a rather trivial (oil) spill,&#x201D; the expert said. Authorities only started taking appropriate measures after Vladimir Putin reacted to the situation, Simonov claimed. Volunteers clean up a bird from oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the settlement of Vityazevo in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, on Jan. 12, 2025. (Stringer/AFP via Getty Images)Inaction by authorities forced locals in affected Russian regions to self-organize, as explained in turn by the anonymous Russian expert. As a result, cleanup operations were conducted haphazardly, without adequate material, creating serious health risks for the hundreds of volunteers who rushed to the shoreline of Krasnodar Krai. The region, which lies east of the Black Sea waters, seems for now to be the most affected by the disaster. As part of the improvised cleanup operation, fuel oil lumps which washed up on its shores were gathered into bags in order to be utilized. However, these bags reportedly never reached processing plants, creating further environmental and public health concerns. The response by authorities in occupied Crimea was &#x201C;even weaker,&#x201D; Gozak claimed, meaning that the disaster will have lasting effects on the peninsula. According to a Russian environmental expert who spoke to Kedr, an independent news outlet that focuses on environmental issues, Russian authorities likely did not even have enough adequate equipment to deal with the consequences of the oil spill. Although conditions in the Black Sea were extreme at the time of the incident, authorities should have trained emergency services to respond to such situations, according to the anonymous Russian expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. Volunteers clean up the shore from fuel oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, Dec. 20, 2024. (Krasnodar Krai Emergency Service)On a positive note, the Black Sea is a dynamic ecosystem with warm waters, which increases the likelihood that the area will be able to clean itself from the fuel oil, possibly even within a year, the expert claimed. Simonov, on the other hand, argued that Mazut fuel oil will remain on the seabed and contaminate ecosystems for the next 10 to 20 years. &#x201C;After the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, this is the second-largest environmental catastrophe in Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion,&#x201D; Gozak said. &#x201C;These accidents are really dramatic, and the worst is that they could have been prevented.&#x201D; Central to understanding this crisis, according to Gozak, is Russia&#x2019;s use of its so-called &#x201C;shadow fleet,&#x201D; which the United States began to go after in the final days of Joe Biden&#x2019;s presidency. In 2022, the EU introduced sanctions on Russian oil delivered by sea, making it in theory impossible for Russia to charter or insure oil tankers which did not comply with the sanctions regime. However, Russia was soon able to circumvent these sanctions, using various schemes to ship its oil worldwide. As these tankers are in a legal gray zone, they often do not comply with security regulations and are not properly insured. This last element makes it even more difficult to coordinate the ongoing Black Sea cleanup operations, as the responsibility of companies running &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; vessels is unclear. The shore polluted with fuel oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, Dec. 20, 2024. (Krasnodar Krai Emergency Service)&#x201C;Stopping this shadow fleet could help prevent such catastrophes, (cut) funding for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and, in the long run, help address climate change,&#x201D; Gozak said. Similar disasters could occur in the future if exports by Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; continue, Simonov added. As for Ukraine, the environmental effect of the disaster is for now mainly felt in occupied Crimea, as well as in parts of the occupied regions of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, which are located on the shoreline of the Sea of Azov. While some oil lumps have also reached the Danube Delta south of Odesa, the amounts collected there are for now, symbolic.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-oil-tanker-crash-causes-ecological-catastrophe-with-black-sea-in-need-of-a-decade-to-recover/	2025-02-02T09:15:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/5474402793822480595-e1736416462922.jpg
The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 3-Feb. 9. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. On Feb. 3-8, Washington will host the 4th annual Ukrainian Week, which seeks to build ties between US and Ukrainian policy-makers and church representatives. Pavlo Unguryan, a notable figure in Ukraine&#x2019;s outreach to US evangelicals, will lead the organization, which will include various religious, cultural, business, and diplomatic events. A delegation of Ukrainian MPs may meet with members of US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team, according to David Arakhmia, head of the ruling Sluha Narodu faction in parliament. The status of US aid to Ukraine will likely be discussed (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked for a government report on the criticality of affected programs; there is talk of appealing for exemptions). However, the main topic of any potential discussions will be the specifics of a US plan to end the war. Trump reaffirmed his desire to pursue a peace deal, hinting at using pressure on Russia to do so in 100 days. Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio&#x2019;s emphasis that both Kyiv and Moscow would need to make concessions signals a difficult path forward. (Note: many in Kyiv are eagerly anticipating the next concrete steps in the process &#x2013; with both a visit by Special Ukraine-Russia Envoy Keith Kellogg and a Trump-Putin call being expected in the coming weeks). On Feb. 3, European leaders will meet at an &#x201C;informal retreat&#x201D; to discuss the potential deployment of troops to Ukraine. This meeting, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, aims to explore the feasibility, scope and political will for such a mission, as the war in Ukraine continues to demand stronger international support. The idea has gained traction recently, but it remains divisive among NATO allies. The UK, France, Nordic and Baltic countries are broadly seen as having a higher degree of readiness, while Poland and Germany are more cautious and will likely remain so until at least after their respective elections. (Of note, there is also discussion on the resumption of Russian gas imports). Effective from Feb. 5, Russia will implement an &#x201C;expulsion regime&#x201D; legislation targeting foreigners or stateless persons. Russian police will be granted enhanced authority to deport foreign nationals or facilitate the acquisition of legal residency status. The next Rada plenary (dates have not been set) will likely consider suspending ex-President Petro Poroshenko for six months for violating ethics rules. If supported, this would demonstrate the ruling coalition&#x2019;s ability to deliver 226 votes on a highly politicized issue.

5 people including 2 children injured in Kherson after Russia targets minibus with drone, governor says	Five people, among them two children, were injured after Russia targeted a minibus with a drone, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Feb. 2. A 12 year-old boy and a 13 year-old girl, along with three adult women, have been diagnosed with concussions after the attack. &quot;All the victims have been taken to medical facilities, where doctors are providing them with the necessary assistance,&quot; Prokudin wrote. Kherson Oblast remains under partial Russian occupation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. The region, including the city of Kherson, is frequently targeted by Russian forces, with regular attacks resulting in civilian casualties. Drone attacks targeting civilians in the southern city of Kherson have become so frequent that locals speaking to the Kyiv Independent last year &#xA0;described the violent campaign as a &quot;human safari.&quot; Under international law, the intentional targeting of civilians who are not actively engaged in hostilities during wartime constitutes a war crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-5-people-including-2-children-injured-in-kherson-after-russia-targets-vehicle-with-drone/	2025-02-02T07:50:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1244779094.jpeg
Zaluzhnyi proposed Kursk-style incursion into Russia's Belgorod Oblast in 2022, Ukrainian general says	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., proposed an incursion into Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast in 2022 to protect Kharkiv Oblast, General Viktor Nazarov told the BBC on Feb. 2. The plan was similar to Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, in August 2024, launched in part in a bid to prevent Russian forces from staging an attack on Sumy Oblast, which was carried out under the command of his successor, Oleksandr Syrskyi. Ukrainian troops seized around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory, though Kyiv has reportedly since lost roughly half of those gains. Clashes continue in the area with Russian forces bolstered by North Korean troops. &quot;The idea was to conduct an offensive on Russian territory, in the general direction somewhere at the junction of Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, toward Belgorod. A political decision was all that was needed,&quot; Nazarov told the BBC. Zaluzhnyi reportedly advocated for a strategy of encirclement or blockade aimed at cutting off the Russian military&#x2019;s ability to carry out fire and missile strikes on Kharkiv. The goal was to &quot;create a threat to the northeastern flank of the supply of material resources for the grouping operating in Donbas,&quot; Nazarov added. When asked why the incursion wasn&apos;t carried out in 2022, Nazarov replied that it was a &quot;political question.&quot; Prior to his dismissal in early February 2024, media reports circulated that the President&apos;s Office and Zaluzhnyi had conflicting ideas about how the war should be carried out. In Kursk Oblast, North Korea&apos;s troops fighting alongside Russian forces have been taking heavy losses and have reportedly been withdrawn from some parts of the front line. They have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that roughly half of the 11-12,000-strong North Korean contingent deployed to the embattled Russian region have been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. On Jan. 22, Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces released footage of them resisting a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.

Russian independent media Meduza, German PR firm pull campaign featuring Ukrainian war victims after backlash	Independent Russian media outlet Meduza and a German PR agency both apologized on Feb. 2 for a promotional campaign that featured photos of Ukrainian war victims. The campaign used a photo of Yaroslav Bazylevych whose entire family was killed when a Russian missile hit their apartment building on Sept. 4 in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. His 7-year-old daughter Emilia, 18-year-old Daryna and 21-year-old Yaryna were killed together with his wife Yevhenia, 43, as they were making their way to a bomb shelter Meduza used a photo from his family&apos;s funeral, as well as other pictures of Ukrainian war victims in a promotional video as part of the campaign, which has now been pulled. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 1 that the images were used without his permission. In its apology, Meduza claimed &quot;the video was selected with care and in full compliance with legal requirements.&quot; &quot;Nevertheless, it included images of Ukrainians who had not given permission for their use. This was a mistake, and we deeply regret it,&quot; it added. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent he considered the use of his photo &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Berlin-based Lure PR agency, which worked on the campaign with Meduza, also issued a public apology on Feb. 2, specifically mentioning the footage of Bazylevych in its campaign which provoked outrage from Ukrainians. The PR agency claimed that their intention was to &quot;stand in solidarity with Ukraine and support independent journalism that challenges Russian propaganda.&quot; The ad campaign has been removed from the agency&apos;s website. Yaroslav Bazylevych&apos;s photo from the funeral of his family, killed in a Russian strike, on the Lure agency&apos;s website that developed a promo campaign for a Russian media outlet Meduza. (Lure / Official website)&quot;We deeply regret that our approach caused distress, particularly regarding the inclusion of Yaroslav Bazylevych,&quot; Lure said in a statement released on their official Instagram. &quot;We have listened to concerns raised and, together with Meduza, have taken the campaign down. We remain committed to supporting those fighting for truth and justice against Russia&apos;s brutal war and propaganda machine.&quot; Meduza has not publicly stated who financed the campaign or where the funds to support it originate from. When asked by the Kyiv Independent who financed the campaign, a spokesperson for Meduza sent a link to the public statement with no further comment. The campaign was met with swift criticism in Ukraine, by both officials and the public. &quot;Exploiting our tragedy to evoke sympathy for Russians is a complete disgrace,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry in a statement. &quot;We demand that all such promo content exploiting Ukrainian suffering caused by Russian terror be removed immediately from all media platforms where it has appeared,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi. Founded in 2014, Meduza, an independent Russian news outlet headquartered in Latvia, was designated a &quot;foreign agent&quot; by Moscow in 2021. The ad campaign was supposed to expand its reach among English-speaking audiences.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-pr-agency-apologizes-for-meduza-campaign-featuring-ukrainian-war-victim/	2025-02-02T05:56:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2174646356.jpg
18-year-old injured in Russian drone attack on Sumy dies	Eighteen year-old Denys Zhurba has died from his injuries following the Jan. 30 Russian drone attack on Sumy, the Sumy City Council reported on Feb. 2. Zhurba sustained severe injuries from the attack when a shahed-type attack drone struck a multistorey building in Sumy shortly after midnight local time. The attack was part of a broader assault involving 81 attack and decoy drones launched against Ukraine. Zhurba&apos;s classmates launched a fundraising campaign for his medical treatment, according to the Sumy City Council. While they succeeded in raising the necessary amount, Zhurba ultimately succumbed to his injuries. The 18 year-old&apos;s father was among the wounded and is currently being treated in the hospital. Ukraine&apos;s northern Sumy Oblast, bordering Russia, is a frequent target of Russian strikes. Children of all ages are often among the victims of Moscow&apos;s nationwide attacks.Overnight, Russia targeted Ukraine&apos;s central Poltava Oblast, killing at least 14 people, including two children.	https://kyivindependent.com/city-council-18-year-old-injured-in-jan-30-attack-on-sumy-dies/	2025-02-02T05:19:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475521295_1053949616763279_2119158003595389289_n.jpg
15,000 Russian troops 'neutralized' in Pokrovsk direction in January alone, Syrskyi says	Some 15,000 Russian soldiers were &quot;neutralized&quot; by Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast during January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 2. In a post on Facebook that included a video of combat footage, Syrskyi said the area &quot;remains one of the hottest&quot; on the front, adding Ukrainian forces were &quot;continuously inflicting losses on the occupiers.&quot; &quot;In January of this year alone, our soldiers neutralized more than 15,000 invaders here, of which about 7,000 were killed,&quot; he added. 0:00/1&#xD7;The video released by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 2 of combat in the Pokrovsk sector (Facebook)The Kyiv Independent could not verify the figures. A report from the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28 said that overall across the front lines, the intensity of Russian assaults was declining, but remains high. It added that Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces were deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the sector, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27. The peak intensity of Russian offensive efforts across the front lines was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/15-000-russian-troops-neutralized-in-pokrovsk-direction-in-january-alone-syrskyi-says/	2025-02-02T04:39:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Putin will never try again after this' — NATO chief has 'secret' ideas for Ukraine peace talks	NATO Chief Mark Rutte has said he has ideas about any future peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow that are a &quot;little secret&quot; but will ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin will &quot;never try again&quot; to conquer Ukraine. In an interview with the German newspaper Bild published on Feb. 1, Rutte was asked if peace between the two countries was even possible. &quot;We must ensure that (Putin) can never, ever again conquer even one square kilometer of Ukraine,&quot; he replied, adding the most important thing for NATO to do right now is to support Kyiv with weapons and training for its soldiers. He went on to say that if Ukraine decides to enter peace talks, it will then have to bring Putin to the negotiating table. &quot;I can&apos;t describe to you exactly how these talks will go,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I already have ideas about what this composition could look like. But we don&apos;t want to make Putin any smarter than he already is. &quot;We&apos;re making it a little secret. Only the end is certain &#x2014; Putin will never try again after this.&quot; Rutte did not elaborate further on his ideas. He was also asked during the interview about the direction of the full-scale invasion, and if Ukraine along with its Western allies were losing given Russia&apos;s continued grinding advances in the Donbas. &quot;The front is moving in the wrong direction. But at what price?,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The Russians are paying for it with 1,000 to 1,500 people a day who are dying or seriously wounded. And yet the Russians are not achieving their goals. &quot;And our job is to ensure that they never achieve their goals. So no, Ukraine is not losing and we must support them in getting into a position of strength.&quot; The comments come a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his team is already engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with the Russian side on how to end the war in Ukraine. In response, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the AP that talks about the war that do not include Ukraine are &quot;very dangerous.&quot; &quot;They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us &#x2014; it is dangerous for everyone,&quot; Zelensky said Zelensky said that the first step for Ukraine is to hold a high-level meeting with Trump, so that Kyiv and Washington can develop their own plans for a ceasefire. Then the parties can move on to discussions that involve Russia. &quot;I believe that, first and foremost, we (must) hold a meeting with (Trump), and that is important. And that is, by the way, something that everyone in Europe wants,&quot; Zelensky said. Following the meeting, &quot;we should move on to some kind of format of conversation with Russians,&quot; he added. &quot;And I would like to see the United States of America, Ukraine, and the Russians at the negotiating table. ... And, to be honest, a European Union voice should also be there. I think it would be fair, effective.

Russia blames Ukraine for deadly strike on Kursk boarding school, Air Force evidence suggests otherwise	Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee launched a &quot;terrorism&quot; probe on Feb. 2 against the commander of Ukraine&apos;s 19th Separate Missile Brigade over a deadly strike on a boarding school being used to shelter civilians in Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine says was carried out by Russia&apos;s military. At least four people were killed and 84 rescued after the attack on the evening of Feb. 1, which the General Staff says was carried out by Russia using a targeted guided aerial bomb strike. &quot;There is indisputable evidence and objective monitoring results showing that the strike was carried out by Russian tactical aviation,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Air Force wrote on Feb. 1, with screenshots published from the Virazh-Tablet system allegedly showing the flight path of the Russian guided aerial bomb. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that Ukraine carried out a missile attack from Sumy Oblast. It did not provide any evidence. The Kyiv Independent could not verify either of these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, writing on Feb. 1 that civilians in the residential facility were being evacuated to safety. Drawing parallels to Russia&apos;s 1990s wars in Chechnya that devastated cities and killed tens of thousands of civilians, he said: &quot;Even against their own civilians, the Russian army uses similar tactics.&quot; A series of apartment bombings occurred in cities across Russia during the late 1990s, which the Russian government blamed on Chechen militants and used as a pretext to escalate military action in Chechnya. In the lead-up to discussions about a potential negotiated ceasefire, Russia is attempting to frame Ukraine as the aggressor, even as it continues to launch daily attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Jan. 20, Russian state-controlled media claimed that they had discovered the bodies of civilians in the village of Russkoe Porechnoe in Kursk region that were &quot;executed&quot; by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The original news story, aired on Rossiya 1, didn&apos;t specify the number of people killed, and the soldier in the footage only mentions four bodies. Later, on Jan. 31, Rossiya 1 aired footage of what they claimed was a Ukrainian soldier &quot;confessing&quot; to taking part in the executions, and the number of civilians killed was suddenly listed as 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-exchange-blame-over-strike-on-residential-facility-in-sudzha/	2025-02-02T03:05:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475810408_1040127424821872_3107816189091721438_n.jpg
Woman in Russian-occupied Crimea fined for 'promoting child-free lifestyle'	A 29-year-old woman in Russian-occupied Sevastopol was fined 50,000 rubles ($500) for &quot;promoting the appeal of a child-free lifestyle&quot; on social media, local occupation authorities reported on Jan. 31. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; in November last year, equating it to the promotion of &quot;non-traditional sexual relations.&quot; When Putin came to power in 1999, Russia&#x2019;s fertility rate stood at 1.18 children per woman, according to data collected by the U.N. It peaked at 1.79 in 2015 but declined to 1.46 in 2024, with the country facing a &quot;devastating&quot; demographic crisis, experts say. According to the local occupation authorities, the woman had been posting &quot;misanthropic content&quot; on her VKontakte social media account and allegedly did not remove it after the law came into effect. Screenshots allegedly from her account, included in the local occupation authorities&apos; Telegram post, show a meme featuring American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino alongside the quote: &quot;Making movies, not babies&#x2014;that&#x2019;s my motto.&quot; The other two screenshots depict characters from TV shows and films flipping the middle finger &#x2014; both have the dates and times of the posts blurred out. Legal experts cited by independent Russian news outlet Agentsvo confirmed that this is the first recorded fine under Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;childfree propaganda&#x201D; law. They warned the case could set a troubling precedent, potentially leading to fines for other non-criminal expressions, such as women speaking about the challenges of motherhood. Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula has been under Russian occupation since 2014, when Moscow seized it following a widely condemned referendum. The report from local occupation authorities does not clarify whether the woman was a Ukrainian resident of Sevastopol before the annexation, but Ukrainian citizens are frequently targeted by the occupying authorities. Russia&apos;s controversial law banning so-called &quot;child-free propaganda&quot; also prohibits the adoption of Russian children by nationals from countries where gender transition surgeries are legal. While Russia faces a looming demographic crisis, the names of nearly 89,000 thousand soldiers killed fighting in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have been identified by independent Russian media. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/woman-in-russian-occupied-crimea-fined-for-promoting-child-free-lifestyle-online/	2025-02-02T00:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-479350285.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 840,360 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 840,360 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 2. This number includes 1,320 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,908tanks, 20,667 armored fighting vehicles, 35,709 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,538 artillery systems, 1,267 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,793 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-840-360-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-01T23:10:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1245325264-1670930356n0giu.jpg
Massive fire breaks out at Kharkiv warehouse after Russian drone attack	A large-scale fire broke out at a warehouse in Kharkiv after a Russian drone struck a civilian enterprise late at night on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Russia launched a drone attack against the city&apos;s Slobidskyi district, causing a massive fire in a production and warehouse facility. The fire spread over an area of 2,000 meters, the State Emergency Service said. Firefighters contained the blaze at 1:27 a.m. local time on Feb. 2. The warehouse was part of a civilian enterprise, according to authorities. No casualties have been reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure with missiles, drones, and glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-fire-breaks-out-at-kharkiv-warehouse-after-russian-drone-attack/	2025-02-01T21:14:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/fire.jpg
They killed Syrians the same way' — Zelensky condemns alleged Russian strike on civilians in Kursk Oblast	President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russia&apos;s alleged bombing of a nursing home in Kursk Oblast, comparing the attack to Russian warfare in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine. The presidents comments come after the Ukrainian military reported a Russian airstrike on a residential facility in the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast on Feb. 1. The attack killed at least four people and critically wounded four others. &quot;This is how Russia waged war against Chechnya decades ago,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;They killed Syrians the same way. Russian bombs destroy Ukrainian homes the same way. And even against their own civilians, the Russian army uses similar tactics.&quot; The targeted building, which served as a shelter, primarily housed elderly residents. Over 80 people were evacuated from the building in the aftermath of the attack. The Ukrainian military said that Russia launched a KAB aerial guided bomb at the site, which they claim was previously targeted by Russian forces in an attack on Jan. 11. The Russian Defense Ministry later on Feb. 1 accused Ukraine of the bombing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force published screenshots from the Virage Tablet system purporting to show the trajectory of the Russian bomb. The system is an automated software program the military uses to track aerial threats. &quot;This is a state devoid of civility,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;And this is an evil that will not stop on its own.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks refer to Russia&apos;s brutal military campaigns against Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, and Russia&apos;s support for former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, now in exile in Moscow. With Russia&apos;s military backing, Assad&apos;s regime imprisoned, tortured, and killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians during its crackdown on opposition forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/they-killed-syrians-the-same-way-zelensky-condemns-alleged-russian-strike-on-civilians-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-01T19:28:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/zel.jpeg
No unit named Georgian Legion' in our agency — Ukraine's military intelligence hits back at Slovakia's coup accusations	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) dismissed claims by Slovak officials that HUR had orchestrated an attempted coup in Bratislava using members of the volunteer-based Georgian Legion. &quot;The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine officially reports that there is no unit called the Georgian National Legion in its structure,&quot; the agency said in a statement on Feb. 1. The statement comes after Slovakia banned Georgian Legion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili from entering the country amid allegations that his unit was connected to a coup plot. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed on Jan. 31 Mamulashvili helped organize mass protests in Slovakia on behalf of Ukraine as part of a hybrid operation against his government. He did not explain how Mamulashvili organized the demonstrations or plotted a coup but said the commander was &quot;subordinate&quot; to HUR. Fico also claimed that the Peace for Ukraine initiative, a group that has helped mobilize the recent protests, had financed the Georgian Legion&apos;s attempts to overthrow the government. HUR &quot;strongly rejects false accusations of organizing illegal actions in the Slovak Republic,&quot; the agency&apos;s statement said. Mamulashvili &quot;has no relation to Ukrainian intelligence, and does not receive any tasks or instructions from the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine. This person terminated his contract with the International Legion of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine in April 2023 and did not renew it,&quot; HUR said. The Georgian Legion is a volunteer unit that has been fighting in Ukraine &#xA0;since 2014. Mamulashvili established the unit to combat Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. Fico&apos;s accusations come at a time of heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. The termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1 triggered retaliatory threats from Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly government, and Fico has reportedly criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky for supporting the protests in Slovakia. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24. Around 100,000 people nationwide chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; voicing opposition to the prime minister&apos;s pro-Russian stance.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-unit-named-georgian-legion-in-our-agency-ukraines-military-intelligence-hits-back-at-slovakias-coup-accusations/	2025-02-01T17:47:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1691800076.jpg
US, EU should be part of Ukraine-Russia peace talks, Zelensky says	The United States and the European Union should join Ukraine and Russia at the negotiating table in future peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Associated Press (AP) in an interview published Feb. 1. The comments come a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his team is already engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with the Russian side on how to end the war in Ukraine. Talks about the war that do not include Ukraine are &quot;very dangerous,&quot; Zelensky told the AP. &quot;They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us &#x2014; it is dangerous for everyone,&quot; Zelensky said, referring to Trump&apos;s earlier remarks. Zelensky said that the first step for Ukraine is to hold a high-level meeting with Trump, so that Kyiv and Washington can develop their own plans for a ceasefire. Then the parties can move on to discussions that involve Russia. &#xA0; &quot;I believe that, first and foremost, we (must) hold a meeting with (Trump), and that is important. And that is, by the way, something that everyone in Europe wants,&quot; Zelensky said. Following the meeting, &quot;we should move on to some kind of format of conversation with Russians,&quot; he said. &quot;And I would like to see the United States of America, Ukraine, and the Russians at the negotiating table. ... And, to be honest, a European Union voice should also be there. I think it would be fair, effective. But how will it turn out I don&apos;t know.&quot; Zelensky told the AP that Moscow is not interested in holding peace talks due to their advantage on the battlefield, but that Trump could force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate by threatening harsher sanctions against Russia. The U.S. should also continue supplying weapons to Kyiv, he said. &quot;I think these are the closest and most important steps.&quot; The president also addressed comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said on Jan. 30 that the war has set Ukraine &quot;back 100 years.&quot; Rubio &quot;needs to come to Ukraine, first of all, to see what Russia has done,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;But also to see what the Ukrainian people did, what they were able to do for the security of Ukraine and the world, as I said, and just talk to these people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-eu-should-be-part-of-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-zelensky-says/	2025-02-01T17:00:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167462835.jpg
Trump launches trade war with steep tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico	U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Feb. 1 imposing steep tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, potentially triggering a trade war between the U.S. and its largest economic partners. The orders placed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, with only a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Trump promised throughout his campaign to use tariffs to pressure foreign countries, threatening traditional allies as well as adversaries. The day before the executive orders, Trump threatened to enact &quot;100% tariffs&quot; on BRICS countries if they attempted to supercede the U.S. dollar in international trade. Trump also threatened to use tariffs to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada were imposed before any negotiations between the U.S. and those countries, according to the New York Times. The first two weeks of Trump&apos;s second term in office have been characterized by a whirlwind of executive orders that have caused domestic and international shockwaves. The administration has frozen foreign aid, cracked down on migrants, and enacted sweeping purges of the federal government. The stoppage of foreign aid has impacted vital organizations in Ukraine, including independent media and groups working to restore the country&apos;s battered energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-launches-trade-war-with-steep-tariffs-on-china-canada-mexico/	2025-02-01T16:09:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196787795.jpg
Ukraine's NATO membership 'cheapest' security guarantee, 'victory' for Trump, Zelensky tells AP	NATO membership is the &quot;cheapest&quot; possible security guarantee for Ukraine and a chance for U.S. President Donald Trump to score a geopolitical victory over Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the Associated Press (AP) on Feb. 1. The question of Kyiv&apos;s future accession to the Alliance is likely a key point of contention in the expected Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, which Trump has pledged to initiate within the next few months. NATO membership is the best possible security guarantee for Ukraine and the &quot;cheapest&quot; option for Western allies, Zelensky told the AP. &quot;I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide. I think this is a great victory for Trump.&quot; Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C. that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian propaganda narratives frequently cite Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. Trump himself has echoed this talking point, saying that former President Joe Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations provoked the full-scale war. &quot;That&apos;s been like written in stone,&quot; Trump said on Jan. 7, referring to Russia&apos;s opposition to Ukraine joining the Alliance. &quot;And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand (Russia&apos;s) feelings about that.&quot; Moscow has said that a ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry to NATO is a key condition of any ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have disputed Trump&apos;s narrative and dismissed Russia&apos;s demands. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry called Russia&apos;s proposed ban &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. Zelensky told the AP that Ukraine&apos;s accession to the Alliance would be mutually beneficial to Kyiv and to member states. The addition of Ukrainian defense forces would also be an asset to NATO, potentially allowing the U.S. to withdraw its troops stationed overseas. French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s proposal to deploy European peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire is also being discussed, Zelensky said. Questions remain as to its feasability, and it would have to be backed by other security measures. &quot;That&apos;s not enough,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Imagine, there is a contingent. The question is who is in charge? Who is the main one? What will they do if there are Russian strikes? Missiles, disembarkation, attack from the sea, crossing of the land borderline, offensive. What will they do? What are their mandates?&quot; Macron and Zelensky are &quot;still in the process of this dialogue,&quot; the president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-membership-cheapest-security-guarantee-victory-for-trump-zelensky-tells-ap/	2025-02-01T15:26:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193463528.jpg
Russia’s new naval base raises fears of Georgia’s involvement in Ukraine war, WSJ reports	Russia is building a new naval base in Ochamchire, Abkhazia, a move that raises fears Georgia could be drawn into the war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports. The base is part of Moscow&#x2019;s strategy to safeguard its naval forces after suffering heavy losses in the Black Sea. Since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has lost or sustained damage to roughly a third of its fleet in the region. Satellite images obtained by the outlet show continued upgrades at the Ochamchira port, including expanded access points to fit larger vessels. Though relatively small, experts say the facility could host ships equipped with cruise missiles, bolstering Russia&#x2019;s military presence in the Black Sea. Ochamchire, more than 700 kilometers southeast of the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, could provide Moscow with a naval base that remains largely beyond the range of Ukraine&#x2019;s existing long-range strikes. Russia has occupied Abkhazia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. The region is internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil. The Wall Street Journal reports that if Ukraine were to target Russian warships there, Georgia could find itself pulled into the war. Beyond military risks, the base threatens a key trade route between Asia and Europe. Before Russia&#x2019;s invasion, more than 85% of land-based trade between China and Europe moved through Russian territory. Sanctions have disrupted that route, shifting attention to the Middle Corridor, which runs through Georgia. The World Bank estimates this corridor could handle 11 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030, up from less than 3 million tonnes in 2023. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-new-naval-base-raises-fears-of-georgias-involvement-in-ukraine-war-wsj-reports/	2025-02-01T12:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1241355624--2--1.jpg
Russia strikes nursing home in Kursk region's Sudzha, Ukraine's General Staff reports	A Russian strike targeted a nursing home in the Ukrainian-captured town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Feb. 1, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. The building, which served as a shelter, primarily housed elderly residents. Nearly 95 people were said to be trapped under the rubble. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify the claims. &quot;At the time of the attack, dozens of local residents were inside the building preparing to evacuate,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. &quot;The Russians knew that the building housed mainly civilians - local residents, including women and children. Everything possible is being done to rescue the survivors.&quot; &#x421;&#x44C;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x43D;&#x456;, 1 &#x43B;&#x44E;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E;, &#x43E; 16:54 &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x430; &#x430;&#x432;&#x456;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x44F; &#x437;&#x430;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x430; &#x443;&#x434;&#x430;&#x440;&#x443; &#x43A;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x44E; &#x430;&#x432;&#x456;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x44E; &#x431;&#x43E;&#x43C;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x44E; (&#x41A;&#x410;&#x411;) &#x43F;&#x43E; &#x456;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x442;&#x443; &#x432; &#x43C;&#x456;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456; &#x421;&#x443;&#x434;&#x436;&#x430; &#x41A;&#x443;&#x440;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456;. &#x423;&#x434;&#x430;&#x440;&#x443; &#x437;&#x430;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x446;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43F;&#x440;&#x44F;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E;.&#x414;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x434;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x448;&#x435;: https://t.co/PCtQnMEw8q pic.twitter.com/J7RFO29H7Z Officials have yet to confirm casualties, but emergency crews have been dispatched to the scene.

The attack, which took place on the evening of Jan. 11, left one woman with severe arm injuries, who died later in the morning of Jan. 12, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi said. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil.

Russian independent media uses Ukrainian war victim in ad campaign, sparking outrage	Russian independent news outlet Meduza used a photo of a Ukrainian man mourning his family killed in a Russian strike to bolster its European promo campaign &#x2014;&#xA0;without his permission, he told the Kyiv Independent. The photo is of Yaroslav Bazylevych, whose entire family was killed when a Russian missile hit their apartment building on Sept. 4 in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Meduza used the man&apos;s photo from his family&apos;s funeral, as well as other pictures of Ukrainian war victims in a promotional video as part of the campaign, first published over two months ago. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent he considered the use of his photo &quot;unacceptable.&quot; The campaign &#x2014; which uses images of Russian atrocities in Ukraine to promote a Russian media outlet &#x2014; has been met with swift criticism in Ukraine, by both officials and the public. &quot;Exploiting our tragedy to evoke sympathy for Russians is a complete disgrace,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry in a statement. &quot;We demand that all such promo content exploiting Ukrainian suffering caused by Russian terror be removed immediately from all media platforms where it has appeared,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi. In a press-release on their English-language website, Meduza said that the video is meant for &quot;bolstering Meduza&#x2019;s crowdfunding efforts&quot; and asked their audience to share it. It was also screened across European capitals in a widespread promotional campaign titled &quot;Where other headlines end, Meduza begins.&quot; The video was developed pro-bono by a Berlin-based creative agency Lure. As of Feb. 1, the agency used Bazylevych&apos;s photo as a title picture for the campaign on their website, with the title &quot;Meduza&quot; posted across his wounded face. Meduza did not publicly state who financed the campaign or where the funds to support it originate from. At the time of publication, Meduza had not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment. Yaroslav Bazylevych&apos;s photo from the funeral of his family, killed in a Russian strike, on the Lure agency&apos;s website that developed a promo campaign for a Russian media outlet Meduza. (Lure / Official website)Bazylevych said that no one contacted him to ask for permission to use his pictures from either Meduza or Lure Agency, despite the agency&apos;s claim that they conducted &quot;meticulous research&quot; to design the campaign. His 7-year-old daughter Emilia, 18-year-old Daryna and 21-year-old Yaryna were killed together with his wife Yevhenia, 43, as they were making their way to a bomb shelter. Bazylevych was lightly wounded in the attack. &quot;I consider it unacceptable for their advertising campaign,&quot; Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent over the text. Bazylevych confirmed over text that he plans to pursue legal action to stop the use of this ad campaign. Kevin Rothrock, Meduza&apos;s English version&apos;s managing editor, told the Kyiv Independent that he wasn&apos;t aware of the campaign. Meduza is an independent Russian media outlet that was founded in 2014 outside of Russia, with its headquarters in Riga, Latvia.

US urges Ukraine to hold elections after ceasefire, Reuters reports	The United States is urging Ukraine to hold elections, possibly by the end of the year, particularly if a truce with Russia is reached in the coming months, according to President Donald Trump&apos;s top Ukraine official. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Reuters that presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the all-out war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that most democratic nations hold elections during wartime and that doing so would strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s democracy. &quot;That&#x2019;s the beauty of a solid democracy, you have more than one person potentially running,&quot; Kellogg said. Trump and Kellogg have indicated they are working on a plan to broker a peace deal within the first months of the new administration, though details remain scarce. While the strategy is still being developed, two sources familiar with White House discussions and a former U.S. official briefed on the matter said Trump officials are considering pushing Ukraine to hold elections as part of an initial ceasefire with Russia. The administration is also debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a more permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. The response from Kyiv to such a proposal remains uncertain, according to Reuters. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that elections could take place if fighting ends and security guarantees are in place to prevent renewed Russian aggression. However, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian government and another official said that the Trump administration has not yet made a formal request for elections by year&#x2019;s end. Ukrainian law currently prohibits elections under martial law, which has been in effect since February 2022. Washington previously raised the issue of elections with Ukrainian officials in both 2023 and 2024 during Joe Biden&#x2019;s presidency, according to two former senior U.S. officials. U.S. diplomats emphasized the importance of elections for democratic legitimacy, but Ukrainian officials resisted, arguing that elections during wartime could create internal divisions and expose Ukraine to Russian disinformation campaigns. The Kremlin has questioned the absence of elections, with Russian President Vladimir Putin insisting that the Ukrainian leader lacks the legal authority to sign binding agreements. However, Putin has said Zelensky could still take part in negotiations if he first repeals a 2022 decree that bans talks with Russia while Putin remains in power. The former Western official familiar with the U.S. proposal expressed concerns that lifting martial law for elections could destabilize Ukraine by allowing mobilized soldiers to leave the military, triggering financial instability, and prompting draft-age men to flee the country. If Trump pressures Ukraine to hold elections, the former Western official warned, the U.S. could be aligning with Russian narratives. &quot;Trump is reacting, in my view, to ... Russian feedback,&quot; the official said. Russia wants to see an end to Zelensky.&quot; Some former U.S. officials doubt that a peace deal will be reached in the coming months or that elections will take place in 2025, given the lack of consensus on how to start formal negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-ukraine-to-hold-elections-after-ceasefire-trumps-envoy-tells-reuters/	2025-02-01T09:05:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Kidnapped Belarusian soldier fighting for Ukraine paraded on Belarusian state-controlled television	Branded a terrorist by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime for taking part in Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia, Vasyl Verameichyk was paraded on state-controlled television in late January for a two-part interview titled &quot;Confessions of a Militant.&quot; During the so-called interview, Verameichyk spoke of plans for an alleged incursion into Belarus, similar to the Ukrainian military&apos;s operation in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Verameichyk also acknowledged some of the challenges he faced during his military service in Ukraine, which Belarusian state-controlled television tried to distort and use to portray Ukrainian military life as rife with drug abuse, corruption, and a pervasive fear of death by the hands of one&#x2019;s own fellow soldiers. After being arrested in Vietnam in November, Verameichyk was swiftly extradited to Belarus. It is believed that he was targeted in a coordinated operation by Lukashenko&#x2019;s security services for having served in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment of Belarusian volunteers fighting for Ukraine. &#x201C;It seems to me that the regime is using all of this for the domestic audience. They need to create the impression that everything around them is chaos, war, and destruction &#x2014; that only Lukashenko can &#x2018;save&#x2019; them,&#x201D; volunteer and journalist Maria Malyavko, a longtime friend of Verameichyk, told the Kyiv Independent. Belarusian volunteers in Ukraine have been attempting to rally Kyiv to help facilitate Verameichyk&#x2019;s freedom. While Malyavko and others who know Verameichyk were relieved to see new footage of him being alive, their relief is tempered by the harsh reality that as long as Verameichyk remains in Belarusian custody, his life and health remain at risk. The Belarusian regime&apos;s media frenzy focused primarily on the revelation of a supposed plan for the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, assisted by Ukrainian and other European intelligence services, to launch an offensive and seize part of Belarusian territory &#x2014; mirroring Ukraine&apos;s ongoing actions in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Verameichyk&#x2019;s time serving in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment was reportedly cut short by a dispute with a staff officer that temporarily prevented him from reentering Ukraine, although those who served alongside him said he was looking for ways to return to the front. &#x201C;I am aware of the existence of a classified part of the strategy for the liberation of Belarus &#x2014; secret protocols that outline specific actions and possible scenarios,&#x201D; Verameichyk told the state propagandist conducting the interview. &#x201C;This is a set of measures developed with the assistance of serious organizations, Western intelligence agencies, the intelligence services of Lithuania, Poland, and, of course, the SBU, aimed at using armed force to seize a certain territory of Belarus.&#x201D; Specifically, Verameichyk pointed to the border town of Malaryta, situated in Belarus&#x2019; western Brest region near the borders of Poland and Ukraine. For some Belarusian exiles who watched the interview, this only added to the spectacle. &#x201C;Vasyl didn&#x2019;t say anything unexpected for us, except for the &#x2018;plans to capture Malaryta,&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x201D; Malyavko said. Vasil Verameichyk, a former fighter of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, was detained in Vietnam and extradited to Belarus in Minsk, Belarus, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Screenshot from ONT video)&#x201C;This topic has been so meme-worthy for a long time that it sounded more like mocking the Belarusian regime, who are going through a severe creative crisis.&#x201D; The bizarre tone of the interview was further marked by mentions of foreign fighters supporting the regiment in its alleged incursion into Belarus. Both the Belarusian and Russian governments regularly label foreign fighters in Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries,&quot; a narrative spread through state-controlled media to reinforce the claim that the West aims to destabilize their so-called region of interest. Propagandists also pressed Verameichyk on internal conflicts within the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, pointing to drug use, though Veremeychyk only acknowledged alcohol and marijuana consumption among some of those serving in the regiment. He further discussed the disconnect between the staff based in Kyiv and those serving on the front lines &#x2014; an issue that is not unique to the regiment but has been observed across the military as a whole. Verameichuk was also asked about the medal he was awarded by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence for his role in coordinating the evacuation of more than 60 Ukrainian soldiers from encirclement near Oleksandrivka in Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Mykolaiv Oblast. He replied that while he never wore the medal, he accepted it &quot;with pride,&quot; a reply that Belarusian state-controlled television characterized as his attempt to &quot;distance&quot; himself from the honor. The Kastus Kalinouski Regiment didn&#x2019;t respond to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment on what was said by Verameichyk, only clarifying that &#x201C;a person who is effectively being held hostage by Lukashenko&#x2019;s authorities may and will say whatever is demanded of them.&#x201D; Although Belarus has not officially joined the full-scale war, it actively supports Russia by serving as a strategic hub for Russian military operations. As a result, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime has designated the soldiers serving in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment as members of a terrorist organization. At the end of the state propaganda film showcasing the capture of Verameichyk in November, the head of Belarus&#x2019; security service declared to the camera that Belarusians fighting alongside Ukraine &quot;should live with the knowledge that Belarus will find them, no matter where they are in the world.&quot; Those who know Verameichyk and served alongside him emphasize that, as a captive of Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime, he was essentially forced to perform for the camera. &#x201C;The interview turned out to be quite soft. Most of the information had already been mentioned by other Belarusian volunteers in opposition media,&#x201D; Andrei Kushnerau, a Belarusian soldier who is currently serving in the Da Vinci&#x2019;s Wolves battalion, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Vasyl handled himself very well, especially considering that he is in captivity.&#x201D; &#x201C;Such &#x2018;interviews&#x2019; are typically watched to read between the lines, to observe how the person comes across, since there&apos;s no other connection &#x2014; it has to be done consciously and with a clear mind,&#x201D; Malyavko added. Kushnerau, alongside other Belarusian volunteers, has been actively lobbying Kyiv to facilitate a prisoner exchange with Minsk aimed at securing the release of Verameichyk, given that the regime&apos;s targeted campaign against him stems from his role in the fight for Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;However, the Ukrainian side has still done nothing to help the person who fought for its freedom,&#x201D; Kushnerau said. The President&#x2019;s Office did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment. While the timeline for securing Verameichyk&apos;s freedom remains uncertain, his friends and fellow soldiers refuse to give up. Instead, they continue to amplify his case, steadfast in their resolve to ensure his plight is not forgotten, holding onto hope that they&#x2019;ll see him again, however elusive it may sometimes seem. &#x201C;In connection with Vasily&apos;s story, I feel like speaking out and shouting: have respect for soldiers!&#x201D; Malyavko said. &#x201C;These are people who take on enormous burdens at the front, and we must carry their burden in civilian life. Unfortunately, we are so far away that we can&#x2019;t help him (directly). And now, almost a miracle is needed to make it possible.&#x201D; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s struggle for a better future is ongoing, especially as the Lukashenko regime continues to target innocent individuals. We must also remember amid all this the many Belarusian soldiers risking their lives to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression &#x2014; they don&apos;t get enough coverage but deserve our recognition and support.

Poland scrambles jets, puts air defense on high alert during Russian missile attack on Ukraine	Polish and other allied aircraft were quickly mobilized on Feb. 1 in response to a large-scale missile attack by Russia on western Ukraine, Poland&apos;s Armed Forces reported on X. &quot;Attention, due to the attack of the Russian Federation performing strikes on facilities located in the west of Ukraine, among others, the operation of Polish and allied aviation in our airspace has begun,&#x201D; the statement said. All available forces and means were activated during the attack, the command said, adding that it was constantly monitoring the situation. In accordance with procedures, fighter jets were dispatched, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance assets were put on high alert, the Polish military said. Russia launched a combined attack of 165 &#xA0;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles at Ukraine overnight and in the morning on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defense intercepted 56 Russian UAVs, the Air Force said. At least seven people were killed and 14 injured in a residential building strike in Poltava. Civilian entreprises and infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky, and Kyiv oblasts were damaged, according to the report. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-scrambles-jets-alerts-air-defense-during-russian-missile-attack/	2025-02-01T06:30:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1601919862.jpg
Emergency power cuts temporarily introduced across Ukraine after Russian missile attack	Emergency power outages were introduced temporarily in seven Ukrainian oblasts on Feb. 1 following a Russian missile attack to prevent the collapse the energy system. The restrictions were applied in Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, according to Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo. Three hours later, Ukrenergo announced that restrictions were lifted across the country. &quot;The enemy continues its energy terror,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushenko in response to the attacks. Earlier on Feb. 1, Poltava Regional Administration reported damage to energy infrastructure in the Myrhorod district. Several hours later, the administration reported that the energy supply was restored in the district. There have been two massive Russian attacks on energy infrastructure over the past month, as well as frequent smaller attacks, but because of the warm weather, the Ukrainian energy grid was able to operate without scheduled blackouts. The outages on Feb. 1 was the second time this year when Ukraine had to introduce emergency power cuts across several oblasts due to the damage of the power system and threat of its collapse after the Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/emergency-power-cuts-introduced-across-ukraine-after-russian-attack/	2025-02-01T04:56:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620452.jpg
Man detained after allegedly killing draft officer in Ukraine's Poltava Oblast	The Poltava Oblast National Police detained a man who allegedly shot a draft officer, stole his weapon, and escaped with another man overnight on Jan. 31. The armed attack happened at a fuel station near Pyriatyn during the escort of conscripts to the 199th training center, the Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces said on Feb. 1. According to a Ground Forces statement, an unidentified man wearing a gray balaclava and military pants approached a serviceman of the Poltava draft office, threatening him with a hunting rifle and demanding that he hand over his weapon. &quot;When he refused, the man shot the soldier. The soldier died on the spot as a result of a serious injury,&quot; the statement said. The attacker seized the soldier&apos;s assault rifle and fled with one of the mobilized conscripts after the attack. Within a few hours of search operations, the police established the location of the attackers, according to a statement by the Poltava Oblast National Police. The man who allegedly shot the soldier was detained, and investigators seized his weapon, the report said. It also specified the shooter was a resident of Poltava region born in 1984. His accomplice was a resident of Poltava born in 1988. Police detained a man who allegedly killed a draft officer in Poltava Oblast on Jan. 31, 2025. (Poltava National Police / Official website)The prosecutor&apos;s office said it had launched a criminal investigation. &quot;The Ground Forces Command strongly condemns the armed attack on the serviceman of the Poltava Regional conscription office and demands a prompt investigation of this crime and severe punishment for the perpetrators,&quot; the Ground Forces wrote in their initial statement. Ukraine has long struggled with manpower shortages on the front to compensate for losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on fighting since the start of the full-scale invasion. Corrupt schemes uncovered throughout the full-scale invasion helping men avoid service have added to the difficulty of shoring up more soldiers for the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/man-was-detained-after-allegedly-killing-a-draft-officer-helping-another-man-escape/	2025-02-01T04:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/natpolice2.jpg

Another terrorist crime,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram in response to the attacks. &quot;Each such terrorist attack proves that we need more support in defending ourselves against Russian terror. Every air defense system, every anti-missile is a life-saver,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-9-injure-36-over-past-day/	2025-02-01T03:22:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-31_21-35-20--2--1.jpg
At least 3 dead, 10 injured in Poltava after Russian missile strike on residential building	Editor note: This is a developing news story. A Russian missile struck a residential building in the city of Poltava in the morning on Feb. 1, killing at least three people and injuring 10 others, including a child, the Ukrainian State Emergency service reported. The attack destroyed all five floors of one of the building&apos;s sections, caused a fire and damaged neighboring buildings. Twenty-one people was rescued from the building, said acting Poltava Oblast Governor Volodymyr Kohut. A search and rescue operation is ongoing at the site. Russia launched attacks on several oblasts overnight, hitting residential buildings in Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, according to Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak. &quot;Attacks on residential buildings, civilians, typical tactics of the Russian army,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. &quot;This is the true face of Russia. Murderers who have absolutely no respect for any leader in the world, or any other nation,&quot; he added. Poltava is a city of around 300,000, located in Poltava Oblast in central Ukraine. The city is situated around 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the border with Russia, and 230 kilometers (143 miles) from the eastern front.

Moldova to provide temporary gas loan to Transnistria following Russian supply halt	Moldova will supply 3 million cubic meters of gas to the Russian-occupied Transnistria region on February 1, under an agreement signed earlier in the week, Reuters reported. Moldovagaz head Vadim Cheban stated that the gas will be delivered as a loan, which must be repaid by March 1, 2025. Transnistria&#x2019;s leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, described the supply as &quot;technical assistance,&quot; emphasizing that it is intended to maintain pipeline pressure rather than provide heating for residents. He also accused Chisinau of delaying the arrival of EU-funded gas and urged the European Commission president to intervene. Meanwhile, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean announced an EU financial aid package of 64 million euros ($66.3 million) to address the energy crisis, with 20 million euros ($20.7 million) of the package allocated for gas supplies to Transnistria. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom claimed that it halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s alleged unpaid debts rather than transit issues. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. The Russian-held region is dependent on Russian supplies while the rest of the country pivoted toward European sellers.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-to-provide-temporary-gas-loan-to-transnistria-following-russian-supply-halt/	2025-01-31T21:07:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2043797379.jpg
AI-powered drone company to assist in demining Ukrainian farmlands	AI company Safe Pro Group has signed a multi-year agreement with Ukrainian agricultural company Nibulon to deploy AI-powered drones for detecting landmines in farmland, BusinessWire reported on Jan. 31. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Economy estimates that over 139,300 square kilometers of land are potentially contaminated with explosives from the ongoing war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion. The partnership will use Safe Pro&#x2019;s SpotlightAI platform, hosted on Amazon Web Services, to survey affected farmland more efficiently. War-related farmland abandonment has already led to $2 billion in lost crops. Safe Pro&#x2019;s AI has processed over 931,000 drone images, identifying more than 18,000 explosive remnants across 10,500 acres, significantly speeding up mine detection. Nibulon, headquartered in Mykolaiv, stands as the sole company in the country&apos;s agriculture sector equipped with a proprietary fleet and shipyard. Specializing in the export of grains like wheat, barley, and corn, Nibulon is a prominent player in the industry. Ukraine remains the world&#x2019;s most mined country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ai-powered-drone-company-to-assist-in-demining-ukrainian-farmlands/	2025-01-31T19:53:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Lithuania's president calls for Ukraine's involvement in peace talks, stronger regional defense against Russia, AP reports	Lithuania&#x2019;s President Gitanas Nauseda emphasized the necessity of Ukraine&#x2019;s full involvement in peace negotiations and increased defense spending by regional countries to prevent future Russian aggression. In an interview with the Associated Press, Nauseda warned that a peace settlement without proper deterrents would allow Russia to consolidate its forces and prepare for further military action.&quot;You cannot believe that the intentions of Russia will be just to stop and do nothing,&quot; he said, stressing that any ceasefire would provide Russia a break to rebuild its military capabilities. Nauseda also raised concerns about potential Russian targets, including Ukraine and the Baltic countries, should the war reach a ceasefire. Lithuania, a country with a history of Soviet occupation until 1990, faces ongoing fears of Russian aggression. Its geographical position, bordering Russia&#x2019;s Kaliningrad exclave and Moscow&#x2019;s ally Belarus, makes Lithuania vulnerable to further conflict. Nauseda explained that, even after a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine, Lithuania will remain exposed to threats from Russia for the foreseeable future. &quot;You always have the threat from the East, and you must be aware and take all the necessary precautionary measures in order not to be attacked,&quot; he cautioned. Lithuania recently committed to increasing its defense spending to at least 5% of its GDP, following a push from U.S. President Donald Trump. This move contrasts with some NATO countries, which have resisted such a significant economic burden. Nevertheless, Lithuania sees this commitment as essential for its security. Nauseda echoed this sentiment, noting the need for his country to strengthen its defense capabilities in light of the ongoing conflict. &quot;This is an absolutely clear priority for this country, as a frontline country, that we have to spend more,&quot; he asserted. In the context of the war in Ukraine, Nauseda stressed the importance of including Kyiv in any peace talks. He declared it would be &quot;unacceptable if the peace would be set behind the doors and without the involvement of Ukraine,&quot; acknowledging the country&apos;s sacrifices in the war. He reiterated that Ukraine &quot;deserves the right to set the conditions of this peace.&quot; As concerns grow about the security of the Baltic region, Lithuania is also focused on the growing threat to its undersea infrastructure. Since October 2023, at least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged, sparking suspicion that the damage may be intentional. The most recent incident occurred when a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland ruptured. In response, NATO launched a mission called &quot;Baltic Sentry&quot; to protect vital underwater infrastructure. Nauseda called for increased maritime capabilities in the region, urging NATO and the EU to take stronger measures to prevent future incidents. &quot;It is time for us to show some muscle,&quot; he declared. Despite some objections within Lithuania regarding the rise in military spending, Nauseda argued that the country must take responsibility for its defense. While Lithuania can rely on NATO allies, the president emphasized that it would be naive to assume others would prioritize the country&apos;s security if it failed to demonstrate the ability to protect itself.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-president-calls-for-ukraines-involvement-in-peace-talks-stronger-regional-defense-against-russia-ap-reports/	2025-01-31T16:49:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2160823562.jpg
Trump claims he and Putin could take 'significant' steps to end Russia’s war in Ukraine	Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 31 that his team has already engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with Russia about its war in Ukraine. He suggested that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take &quot;significant steps&quot; toward ending the conflict. &quot;We will be speaking, and I think we will perhaps do something that&#x2019;ll be significant,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;We want to end that war. That war would not have started if I was president.&quot; Trump did not clarify who in his administration has been in contact with Russia but insisted that discussions were already underway. When asked if he had personally spoken with Putin, he declined to answer directly: &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to say that.&quot; He has repeatedly claimed that the war would not have started under his leadership, despite the fact that hostilities between Ukraine and Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine escalated during his presidency, leading up to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Since returning to office, Trump has criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, arguing that he should have negotiated with Putin to prevent the war. He has also promised to end the conflict quickly if elected in 2024, frequently attacking President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration for providing billions in military and economic aid to Ukraine. In a recent interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump, calling him a &quot;clever and pragmatic man&quot; focused on U.S. interests. &quot;We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,&quot; Putin said. &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t disagree with him that if he had been president if they hadn&#x2019;t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s relationship with Putin has long been a subject of scrutiny. During his 2016 campaign, he publicly urged Russia to find and release Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s deleted emails. As president, he dismissed U.S. intelligence findings on Russian election interference and instead sided with Putin, later calling his actions in Ukraine &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-and-putin-could-take-significant-steps-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150483714.jpg
Ukrainian director Chernov wins Documentary Directing award at Sundance	Ukrainian journalist and director Mstyslav Chernov won the Best Documentary Direction award at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 31 for his film &quot;2,000 Meters to Andriivka&quot; in the World Cinema category. The documentary follows Ukraine&#x2019;s 2023 counteroffensive, as Chernov embeds with a platoon from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. Their mission was to liberate Andriivka, a strategically important village in Donetsk Oblast. Surrounded by mines, the village is accessible only through a narrow stretch of forest, making the battle particularly grueling. &#x1F3C6; The Directing Award: World Cinema Documentary goes to Mstyslav Chernov @mstyslavchernov for &#x201C;2000 Meters to Andriivka&#x201D; pic.twitter.com/wc1W1RP9lO &quot;This is the story of Ukrainian soldiers fighting for every inch of their land,&quot; Chernov said. &quot;It&#x2019;s the story of a small forest and the village of Andriivka, located just two hours from my hometown. It&#x2019;s the story of modern warfare&#x2014;how it&#x2019;s fought, how it&#x2019;s endured, and how it changes us.&quot; Chernov worked on the project with Associated Press photographer Oleksandr Babienko. The film was produced by Michelle Misner and Rainey Aronson-Rath, both of whom won an Oscar for &quot;20 Days in Mariupol.&quot; Misner also served as the film&#x2019;s editor. Chernov, an acclaimed war correspondent and documentary filmmaker, was invited last year to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a body of more than 10,000 members that votes on the annual Oscar winners. His previous film, &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 96th Academy Awards last March. The film captures the Russian siege of Mariupol in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion, offering a firsthand account from Chernov and his team. It is the first Ukrainian-directed film to ever receive an Oscar.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-director-chernov-awarded-best-documentary-director-at-sundance/	2025-01-31T13:27:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1759941515.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean troops not seen for 3 weeks in parts of Kursk Oblast, Ukraine’s special forces say	Key developments on Jan. 31: North Korean troops have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment comes as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been taken off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent, confirming the reports. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that roughly half of the 11-12,000-strong North Korean contingent deployed to the embattled Russian region have been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. In a video, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. The Ukrainian fighters held off the assault with small arms, grenade launchers, and snipers. Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. Previous comments by Ukrainian officials earlier this week suggest that North Korean troops may have been taken off the front lines only temporarily. Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb, the Unmanned Systems Forces said on Jan. 31. The drone is described as a &#x201C;unique development&#x201D; and a potential game changer on the battlefield. The military did not disclose the number of drones in service or additional details about their capabilities. &quot;Russian propaganda constantly claims to have &apos;shot down&apos; such aircraft, but explosions at military-industrial complexes, refineries, and ammunition depots suggest otherwise,&quot; the statement read. The drones, operated by Ukraine&apos;s 14th Regiment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, have targeted Russian facilities for more than a year, &#x201C;flying hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometers,&#x201D; according to the statement. &#x201C;There have already been dozens of such missions, and there will be more,&#x201D; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, in Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Flashes and explosions were recorded near the plant, though the extent of the damage is still being assessed, the military said, adding it was &quot;one of the 10 largest oil refineries in Russia in terms of design capacity.&quot; &quot;The refinery produces gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, and aviation fuel,&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, later said. The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast &#xA0;lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine, and was targeted in a joint operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). It has been targeted multiple times during the war, including in February, July, and September 2023. Russian forces launched missile strikes on Odesa&#x2019;s historic center on the evening of Jan. 31, injuring at least two people, Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said. Three explosions were reported around 8 p.m. local time, shortly after Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force warned of missile launches from the Black Sea. &quot;The strikes are directly targeting the city, hitting ordinary civilian buildings. Again and again: Air defense systems are the first priority,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Videos and photos shared on social media show damage to the five-star Bristol Hotel. One of the injured is a hotel employee, according to Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper. Debris also fell near the Opera House, a well-known downtown landmark. Trukhanov said the attack caused significant damage in Odesa&#x2019;s UNESCO-protected historic district.

(Oleh Kiper/Telegram)Finland announces $206 million military package for UkraineThe Finnish government has approved its 27th military aid package for Ukraine worth 198 million euros ($206 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on Jan. 31. This brings Finland&apos;s total defense aid provided to Ukraine since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 to 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion). As with the previous Finnish aid packages, the content of the latest tranche is classified. &quot;This package of almost 200 million euros has been built in close cooperation with Ukraine. We are providing exactly the kind of support that will help Ukraine defend itself in an acute situation on the front,&quot; Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said in a press release. &quot;It is up to us Europeans how Europe&apos;s security continues to develop. Securing Ukraine&apos;s independence and ability to defend itself is the most important thing right now,&quot; Hakkanen said.

US foreign aid transformed Ukraine. Its suspension threatens a setback	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The Kyiv Independent isn&#x2019;t a recipient of U.S. foreign aid, and its funding wasn&#x2019;t affected by the aid freeze. With the stroke of a pen, U.S. President Donald Trump last week put a freeze on projects that have helped Ukraine become freer and more democratic since the earliest days of its independence in 1991. The White House ordered a 90-day suspension of U.S. foreign aid-funded projects globally, to ascertain if they aligned with &quot;American interests&quot; and &quot;American values.&quot; The agencies affected include the National Endowment for Democracy, the Food for Peace Emergency Program, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization particularly active in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more. Yet USAID&apos;s support for Ukraine began well before the full-scale invasion and, according to people who have worked on such projects, their work is vital, and their value immeasurable. Ukrainian photographer Vladyslav Sodel, who has been capturing USAID&#x2019;s work in Ukraine for the past eight years, said people &quot;can&apos;t even imagine&quot; how deeply all the funds provided by USAID have become woven into Ukrainians&apos; lives &quot;to the point where they don&#x2019;t even suspect it.&quot; In a post on Facebook, Sodel said this aid ranges from &quot;a bed with a mattress&quot; for war refugees, to &quot;multi-billion-dollar investments&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure that has been ravaged by Russian mass missile attacks. This &quot;support from the American people&quot; has allowed Ukrainians to &quot;move forward and achieve something greater,&quot; he added. Opinion polls show that Americans significantly overestimate the proportion of the U.S. federal budget that is spent on foreign aid, believing it to be around 25 percent when in fact it was only around 1 percent in 2023, amounting to just 0.25% of GDP. Yet due to the size of the U.S. economy, this translates to 40 percent of all humanitarian aid globally. And it&apos;s not just a one-way street &#x2014; while hugely benefiting the citizens of the countries in which it is spent, U.S. foreign aid also has positive impacts on American citizens back home, Professor Liam Swiss, a foreign aid expert and head of the department of sociology at Canada&apos;s Acadia University, told the Kyiv Independent. Highlighting USAID programs to fund polio immunization, Swiss said that unless someone steps in to fill the gap, it could harm the global drive to eradicate the disease. &quot;The only reason we aren&apos;t dealing with polio in the U.S. or in Canada, or the U.K. now, is because we&apos;ve kind of had these successful immunization campaigns to eliminate it,&quot; he said. Another consequence of reducing or cutting foreign aid that Swiss highlights is the potential of it exacerbating one of the most pressing issues for many Trump supporters &#x2014; immigration.

(Oleksii Samsonov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;If you abandon support&#x2026; does that actually start to drive further migration from those parts of the world that are then furthering the MAGA-perceived border crisis?&quot; he said. According to Deborah Fairlamb, the co-founder of Green Flag Ventures, who previously worked on several USAID-funded projects in Ukraine, there is also a public misconception that USAID is used by the U.S. to dictate terms and conditions on countries, a mistruth often exploited by Russia and its supporters. &#x201C;It&apos;s not the U.S. coming in and unilaterally telling Ukraine what it needs and deciding this. It is always done in conjunction with (the state) and the approval,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent, adding the Russian propaganda narrative that &quot;USAID is an arm of the CIA&quot; has no basis in reality. With the signing of a bilateral agreement between Ukraine and USAID in 1992, the agency started working alongside the Ukrainian government to build a competitive market economy, implement crucial social reforms, provide humanitarian, technical, and financial assistance, and help Ukraine navigate its post-Soviet transition. &#x201C;Thus began a 30-year partnership that has endured, animated by the belief that by working together, we can forge a secure and prosperous future for all Ukrainians,&#x201D; reads the USAID statement on its work in Ukraine. In over 30 years of working in Ukraine, USAID has played a key role in transforming numerous sectors that often go unnoticed. Dmytro Boyarchuk, the executive director of the Centre for Social and Economic Research (CASE Ukraine), said that Ukraine would not have been able to implement vital reforms without the support of international donors like USAID. The USAID&#x2019;s technical assistance program which provides expert advice, support, and resources to help countries implement reforms and achieve development goals, played a big role in transforming Ukraine after the EuroMaidan Revolution that ended the rule of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. Boyarchuk says that back then, the &quot;reform-minded&quot; people took advantage of it to introduce changes and push solutions through the parliament. USAID&apos;s efforts have also included supporting judicial reforms and anti-corruption initiatives, and promoting transparency and accountability in governance. It also supported Ukraine&#x2019;s 2014 decentralization reform, which granted more economic and political freedom to small villages and towns. While USAID&#x2019;s impact on freedom of speech in Ukraine can only be traced &quot;indirectly,&quot; the organization greatly supported Ukrainian human rights activists and journalists, says Oksana Romaniuk, chief of the Kyiv-based Institute of Mass Information (IMI). &quot;We, in turn, monitored freedom of speech, we made statements, we held protests, we developed media legislation,&quot; Romaniuk told the Kyiv Independent, adding USAID was a &quot;supporting structure&quot; for independent media. But in 2022, Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion reshaped the focus and priorities of USAID&#x2019;s work in Ukraine. &quot;When the (all-out) war started, everything shifted into survival mode. And it was not just USAID, it was the entire country,&quot; says Fairlamb. Before that, USAID may have been helping a community &quot;develop a business plan and figure out how best to use the new tax-free resources,&quot; Fairlamb says, but after Feb. 24, 2022, the critical issue became &quot;making sure people in that community had electricity, and that those who had been displaced could find homes.&quot; It is these seemingly small efforts that have played a crucial role in helping Ukraine lessen the devastating impact of the full-scale war. Mykolaiv-based entrepreneur Tetiana Viaznikova says the small grant that she received thanks to USAID has helped save lives during the war. Back in 2021, Viaznikova launched her first aid course &quot;Sample&quot; but Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war forced her to switch to working at a military administration center in southern Ukraine. Then last summer, she quit her job and decided to scale the courses up. A small grant of Hr 410,000 (around $9,700) allowed her to purchase new tourniquets and mannequins, expand her course offerings, and order a marketing strategy. &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t just money to get by &#x2014; it was a boost that helped me scale my business,&quot; Viaznikova says. &quot;Thanks to a marketing strategy, I found clients and continue to train people.&quot; Since last fall, over 750 people have undergone her training, and several of them have already saved lives using their new skills. &quot;For small business owners and those just starting out, even small amounts of money, like mini-grants, provide a foundation that gives you the opportunity to start and scale up,&quot; Viaznikova says.

(Volodymyr Tarasov / Ukrinform / Getty Images)There are thousands of success stories like Viaznikova&#x2019;s across Ukraine, all made possible by USAID, from training teachers and providing scholarships for researchers, to supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure and agriculture. A farmer from war-torn Kharkiv Oblast managed to save his crops after receiving costly fertilizers for free, while Ukrainian internally displaced persons (IDPs) gained access to vital medication and essential goods. The work of USAID in just one territorial community in Chernihiv Oblast amply demonstrates its impact. USAID-funded projects have created spaces for young people, organized workshops and training sessions for locals, supplied new equipment for municipal services and hospitals, and much more. &quot;The stop of USAID&#x2019;s support means lost opportunities,&quot; Andriy Tkach, the secretary of the Sosnytsia village council, told the Kyiv Independent. While the U.S. has issued a waiver for &quot;life-saving humanitarian assistance,&quot; most USAID-funded programs in Ukraine now face at least a three-month pause in funding, and an even more dire situation if it is not renewed after the U.S. State Department review. Boyarchuk said Ukraine&#x2019;s agriculture sector &#x2014; &quot;the key sector today that is holding up the economy, with more than 60% of commodity exports being agricultural products&quot; &#x2014; is largely dependent on donors&#x2019; support. &quot;And while we praise their (farmers&#x2019;) resilience, their equipment was damaged, destroyed, or taken &#x2014; this is all a significant cost, and they have to continue working,&quot; he adds. Many Ukrainian non-profits and media outlets are already appealing for alternative funds and donations, while others have decided to halt certain operations. Veteran Hub, an NGO that supports Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families, announced that it had to close its operations in Vinnytsia. Ukrainian Veterans at Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)Ukrainian media, especially regional outlets, are under threat as well. According to Romaniuk, nearly 90% of regional media funding relies on grants, with advertising accounting for only 3-10% of their revenue. &quot;At the start of the invasion, over 300 regional outlets shut down due to financial strain, Russian attacks, and people fleeing,&quot; Romaniuk says, adding: &quot;This may lead to another wave of media shutdowns.&quot; Bogdan Logvynenko, founder of Ukrainer, a popular online magazine that lost most of its funding due to the U.S. aid freeze, says that Trump&#x2019;s decision is not just about Ukraine &quot;but about a new isolationist policy of the U.S.&quot; &quot;How will the (media) sector survive this? I think it may shrink by half,&quot; he says.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-us-foreign-aid-transformed-ukraine-through-the-years/	2025-01-31T11:42:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/48381089_2332694146962651_4325046064370417664_n.jpg
Ukraine's unlikely ally against Russian attacks on energy sector — warm weather	Nearly three years into the war, Ukrainians have grown used to bracing for brutal winters with electricity blackouts and heating cuts from Russian attacks on the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. This winter was predicted to be one of the toughest ones of the war yet. In a worst-case scenario, blackouts were expected to reach 20 hours a day. Greenpeace warned in November that Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid faced a &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure.&#x201D; But thanks to a combination of unseasonably warm weather, and Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to adapt to a third year of Russian campaigns against its energy system, the worst has not come to pass. Since Russia began targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure in late 2022, the country has learned to better protect the power grid, figuring out how to make repairs in record time following Russian strikes. Climate change &#x2014; which has been causing warmer winters each year in Ukraine &#x2014; has also become Ukraine&apos;s unexpected ally in resisting Russia&#x2019;s tactic of freezing Ukrainians into submission. &#x201C;The fact that we have such warm weather of +6, +7 degrees Celsius (42-44 degrees Fahrenheit) is fantastically positive for us,&#x201D; said Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of the Energy Industry Research Center, crediting the mild winter as a main factor for the lack of problems with power in Ukraine. In the past, Ukraine had hot summers and cold winters, consistent with its mostly continental climate. Snow and temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) characterized every winter, including the one in 2014 when the Euromaidan Revolution unfolded and protesters on Independence Square in Kyiv danced to patriotic chants to warm up. Things are different now. Ukraine&#x2019;s Environment Ministry on Jan.19 went as far as to say in a social media post that, &#x201C;Due to global warming, there is no climactic winter in Ukraine (this year).&#x201D; &#x201C;If the winter used to be a season of frost and snow, then now the weather often reminds of late autumn or early spring,&#x201D; the ministry wrote. The Central Geophysical Observatory declared 2024 &#x201C;the warmest year on record&#x201D; in Kyiv, with the December average at zero degrees Celsius. Temperatures were above zero every day the last week of January, a record for the country, the observatory said. &#x201C;Ukraine is one of the regions of the planet where the temperature has been rising at the highest rate over the past decade,&#x201D; said Svitlana Krakovska, head of the applied climatology laboratory at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute. &#x201C;And the main warming occurs primarily in winter,&#x201D; she was cited as having said in the ministry&#x2019;s post on social media. Ukraine hasn&#x2019;t yet had to implement any country-wide rolling blackouts in 2025, according to open data collected by the Energy Map. These scheduled limitations of electricity supply for businesses and households were put in place at various times throughout the previous years to cut the consumption in peak hours to avoid the collapse of the country&#x2019;s strained power system. Hours-long blackouts were widely used throughout the country for much of the spring and summer of 2024 following Russia&#x2019;s bombing of power plants and transmission stations, and during scheduled repairs of the nuclear power plants. The power cuts were implemented sporadically throughout December. Women ride a scooter on Khreshchatyk Street in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 23, 2025, amid the Russian invasion.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;As you can see, electricity is now being supplied without restrictions almost all over the country, apart from the front-line regions, where the situation is difficult in general,&#x201D; Kharchenko told the Kyiv Independent. As the temperature continues to hover at or above zero, the country&#x2019;s energy system hasn&#x2019;t yet entered a red zone where it has to start cutting power. &#x201C;Every degree below zero Celsius requires an additional 200 megawatts (MW) of power,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;With our current operating capacities, we simply don&#x2019;t have enough (to cater) for temperatures of minus three and four degrees Celsius (24-26 degrees Fahrenheit) and below.&#x201D; Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian critical infrastructure since it began its campaign in 2022, destroying over half of the country&#x2019;s pre-war power system capacities. &#x201C;In 2022-2023, Ukraine&apos;s power system lost about 21 gigawatts (GW) of capacity,&#x201D; out of the 47 GW before the full-on war, wrote Oksana Zueva, a senior expert in open data at Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group. To take that much capacity out, Moscow carried out at least thirty massive attacks on energy facilities, according to open data gathered by the Energy Map. The attacks evolved over time to use various weapons and tactics, while Russia&#x2019;s goal remained the same: plunging Ukraine into a humanitarian crisis, making regular citizens&#x2019; lives as difficult as possible, and destabilizing the country before any possible peace talks in the future.

(Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Around 10 GW of energy generation was knocked out in 2024 due to Russia&#x2019;s missile and drone attacks, the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Since mid-November, six massive attacks were launched by Russia over the two and a half months of this winter season, causing &#x201C;much greater damage and destruction than in previous years,&#x201D; the ministry added. The attacks included anywhere between 70 to 90 cruise or ballistic missiles and 90 to 120 drones each time, as well as internationally banned cluster munitions. &#x201C;But they didn&#x2019;t reach their goals,&#x201D; Kharchenko told the Kyiv Independent. According to Kharchenko, Ukraine has also gotten much better in resisting Russia&#x2019;s attacks on energy in over two years since they began. It improved coordination with air defense protecting the power system and built some fortifications that have already proved effective. Experience also helps when the attacks succeed: at this point, there are reserves of equipment to restore the damaged facilities and clear plans for bypassing them in the grid and restoring them as quickly as possible, Kharchenko said. A lot of that equipment is pledged or financed by international partners, the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In 2024, Ukrenergo&apos;s repair teams set an absolute record by replacing an autotransformer at one of its substations within three weeks,&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This included transportation, installation, and connection. For comparison, in EU countries, such works are carried out in three to four months,&#x201D; the statement said. Warm weather also contributed to the speed of repairs, Ukrenergo said. However, with temperatures projected to drop in the coming days, Ukraine needs to secure its energy supply for any weather.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;For the Ukrainian power system to operate efficiently and confidently, we need to build about 4-4.5 GW of additional peaking power plants,&#x201D; Kharchenko said. Peaking power plants are meant to step in during peak periods of consumption to avoid blackouts. They should be able to quickly increase or decrease the energy output, which is impossible for the three Ukrainian-controlled nuclear power plants that currently supply up to 55-60% of the country&#x2019;s energy, according to Kharchenko. Peaking power plants could be coal-based, hydroelectric, or gas-powered, Kharchenko added, as other types of power are either dependent on weather conditions or too long to develop. But so far, it was coal-based thermal plants, hydroelectric plants, and the transmission grid around them that were targeted by Russian attacks the most. Eighty percent of Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-war coal-fired power capacities were destroyed, though some of them were restored, Kharchenko said. Nine Ukrainian hydroelectric plants remaining after Russia&apos;s destruction of the Kakhovka dam still generate up to 12% of the country&#x2019;s energy despite Russian attacks. &#x201C;Unfortunately, we can&#x2019;t build many of them,&#x201D; Kharchenko said, referring to the limitations of the country&#x2019;s natural river resources needed to build more hydroelectric generation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-unlikely-ally-against-russian-attacks-on-energy-sector-warm-weather/	2025-01-31T11:32:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194146058.jpg
Russian missiles strike Odesa’s historic center, injuring 2	Russian forces launched missile strikes on Odesa&#x2019;s historic center on the evening of Jan. 31, injuring at least two people, Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said. Three explosions were reported around 8 p.m. local time, shortly after Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force warned of missile launches from the Black Sea. &quot;The strikes are directly targeting the city, hitting ordinary civilian buildings. Again and again: Air defense systems are the first priority,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Videos and photos shared on social media show damage to the five-star Bristol Hotel. One of the injured is a hotel employee, according to Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper. Debris also fell near the Opera House, a well-known downtown landmark. Trukhanov said the attack caused significant damage in Odesa&#x2019;s UNESCO-protected historic district. The city&apos;s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in January 2023. In July of that year, a Russian missile strike damaged over 20 architectural monuments and heavily hit the Transfiguration Cathedral. Odesa, a port city on Ukraine&#x2019;s Black Sea coast with a population of around 1 million, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks throughout the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-targets-odesa-historical-center/	2025-01-31T11:26:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1241068016.jpg
Netherlands to send more F-16s in 2025, Ukrainian defense minister says	The Netherlands will deliver another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 31. Ukraine has already received U.S.-made F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them in air defense roles during Russian missile strikes. The first jets arrived in August 2024. The F-16 program was a key focus of Umerov&#x2019;s meeting with Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans in The Hague. The Netherlands will continue training Ukrainian pilots, engineers, and technicians, Umerov said after visiting the base where Ukrainian personnel are gaining hands-on experience in servicing and repairing the aircraft. &quot;This is yet another step toward establishing a full-fledged aviation infrastructure in Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. Umerov also met with representatives of Dutch defense companies who showcased missiles, drones, and radars. He and Brekelmans discussed further development of Ukraine&#x2019;s drone capabilities, the 400 million euros ($415 million) in military aid previously announced by the Netherlands, and joint projects to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike capacity. &quot;Industrial cooperation is another key focus. The next logical step is the development of joint defense enterprises to strengthen our armed forces,&quot; Umerov added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-new-batch-of-f-16-batch/	2025-01-31T11:17:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/474771783_1011806427434364_8970661374252198735_n.jpg
Ukraine deploys long-range drone capable of 2,000 km strike, military says	Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb, the Unmanned Systems Forces said on Jan. 31. The drone is described as a &#x201C;unique development&#x201D; and a potential game changer on the battlefield. The military did not disclose the number of drones in service or additional details about their capabilities. &quot;Russian propaganda constantly claims to have &apos;shot down&apos; such aircraft, but explosions at military-industrial complexes, refineries, and ammunition depots suggest otherwise,&quot; the statement read. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes in an effort to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war efforts. The drones, operated by Ukraine&apos;s 14th Regiment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, have targeted Russian facilities for more than a year, &#x201C;flying hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometers,&#x201D; according to the statement. &#x201C;There have already been dozens of such missions, and there will be more,&#x201D; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare tactics. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. Ukraine produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, according to Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-deploys-long-range-drone-capable-of-2-000-km-strike-military-says/	2025-01-31T09:57:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-31-193201.png
Defense Ministry approves Ukrainian-made Hromylo drone for military use	The Ukrainian-made Hromylo unmanned aerial vehicle has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 31. Equipped with engines capable of carrying a payload, the first-person-view (FPV) drones can target personnel, equipment, and field shelters, according to the statement. These drones are capable of operating both day and night and are resistant to electronic warfare, the ministry added. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and successfully deployed for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the ongoing war with Russia. As of December, Ukraine has delivered over 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-homemade-hromylo-aerial-vehicle-for-military-use/	2025-01-31T09:29:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/hromylo-99e244dbfd.webp
Ukraine’s inflation set to peak by mid-2025, cool to 8% by year-end, central bank says	Ukraine&#x2019;s inflation rate is expected to peak at 15% by mid-2025 before dropping to 8.4% by year&apos;s end, Ukraine&#x2019;s Central Bank said on Jan. 31. Poor harvests and higher wages amid labor shortages are currently driving the rising inflation, according to the bank. Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% year-on-year in December 2024, surpassing the bank&#x2019;s earlier projections. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and fuel, rose to 10.7% in December 2024, with service prices increasing by 12.5%. The bank responded by raising its key interest rate to 14.5% to curb inflation expectations. After peaking in the middle of the year and cooling to 8.4% by year&#x2019;s end, the bank expects inflation to reach a target 5% in 2025. The slowdown is expected to be driven by the bank&#x2019;s interest rate policy measures, currency market stability, a new harvest, a narrowing of the fiscal deficit, and moderate external price pressure. Ukraine has secured assurances from its international partners for $38.4 billion in financial aid for 2025, including support from the U.S., said Andrii Pyshnyi, the bank&#x2019;s head. The risk of not receiving the expected funding in 2025 is low, he said. &quot;External financing, together with the possibilities of the domestic debt market, will allow the government to cover the budget deficit without resorting to emission,&quot; Pyshnyi wrote on Facebook. The bank expects real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 3.6% in 2025, with further acceleration to around 4% in the next two years. Growth will come from investments in energy and production recovery, growing domestic demand, and better harvests. The impacts of the war, labor issues, and low production investment will hold continue GDP growth back. The bank&#x2019;s forecast is based on continued international support and a gradual economic recovery, including a return of Ukrainians who fled abroad at the outset of the full-scale invasion, as well as investment growth.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-inflation-set-to-peak-by-mid-2025-cool-to-8-by-year-end-central-bank-says/	2025-01-31T08:48:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-502752806-1.jpg
SBU probes alleged leak of Budanov’s statement on threat to Ukraine’s existence	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a criminal investigation following media reports alleging that Ukraine&#x2019;s spy chief made a statement about a threat to the country&#x2019;s existence during a closed-door parliamentary meeting, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 31, citing the SBU. The case was opened under the legal provision on the disclosure of state secrets. Ukrainska Pravda published an article on Jan. 27 claiming that Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR), warned of serious consequences for Ukraine&#x2019;s existence if negotiations do not begin by the summer. The report, which cited an unnamed lawmaker who attended the meeting, did not specify what developments Budanov was allegedly referring to. HUR denied the report, calling the alleged quote attributed to Budanov &#x201C;false.&#x201D; The SBU said the investigation involves individuals who had access to the classified session in parliament. &quot;We act within the law and strictly adhere to professional journalistic standards. Ukrainska Pravda, as always, stands by its sources, which are protected under Ukrainian and international law,&quot; said Sevgil Musayeva, Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s editor-in-chief. The reports come amid growing speculation about potential peace talks, as U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-probes-alleged-leak-of-budanovs-statement-on-threat-to-ukraines-existence/	2025-01-31T08:30:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2180021113.jpg
Norway should cede its war windfall to Ukraine	Norway&#x2019;s government has effectively become a war profiteer, we argued in a commentary in December. It is an opinion shared by a number of European politicians, and by European and Norwegian media. But rather than paying attention, Norway&#x2019;s government is getting defensive. The basic facts are not up for debate. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War caused natural gas prices to rise sharply in Europe, Norway reaped windfall profits totaling some 108 billion euros ($113 billion), according to the Norwegian Finance Ministry. That is more than the value of all military and civilian support Ukraine has received from the United States and Germany combined from when the war started through October 2024. It is roughly one-third of the value of the Russian central-bank assets that are currently frozen in the West (and which Western governments have extensively debated channeling to Ukraine for defense and reconstruction). But Norway has kept its windfall for itself, providing a measly 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in aid to Ukraine in its 2025 budget, only slightly up from the previous year. This approach is simply wrong: Norway must transfer its recent &#x201C;super-profits,&#x201D; excess profits above the normal level, in full, directly to Ukraine. Unfortunately, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re and Norwegian Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum seem more interested in justifying their decision not to do so than in helping Ukraine, Europe, or even future Norwegians. St&#xF8;re and Vedum contend that the windfall gains were a normal result of the myriad market forces that determine gas prices. But this argument is disingenuous. While it is true that many factors shape energy prices, Norway&#x2019;s excess profits overwhelmingly reflect one: in 2022-23, it had in Europe a captive market for its natural-gas exports. This was a direct result of the Ukraine war: Russia had cut its natural-gas supplies to Europe, but European gas importers had not yet managed to build liquefied natural gas terminals to offset the loss. St&#xF8;re and Vedum do not stop at dismissing Norway&#x2019;s war profits as good fortune; they claim that their government, and the oil companies operating in Norway, did our European neighbors a favor by stepping up gas supplies when Russian deliveries ceased. Europe should be thanking us, Vedum says. This &#x201C;Good Samaritan&#x201D; narrative smacks of hypocrisy, especially as Norway, while pocketing its lucky gains from the spike in gas prices, sends a pittance to the Ukrainians fighting and dying for their country&#x2019;s survival and Europe&#x2019;s security. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re speaks to the press after the Think Tank Agenda event at the University Aula in Oslo, Norway, on Jan. 28, 2025. (Ole Berg-Rusten / NTB / AFP via Getty Images)In fact, from the perspective of European gas consumers, the elevated gas prices were equivalent to a Norwegian &#x201C;war tax&#x201D; on them. The increased energy costs strained the budgets of households and companies, thereby reducing European governments&#x2019; room to raise taxes for supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort. And yet, many of these countries have still managed to provide far more support to Ukraine, as a share of GDP, than Norway has. St&#xF8;re and Vedum say that, rather than use its windfall as a &#x201C;political instrument,&#x201D; the excess profits should go directly into the Government Pension Fund Global, Norway&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, where they will be preserved for future generations of Norwegians. This position aligns with Norway&#x2019;s longstanding commitment to safeguarding its long-term fiscal sustainability, exemplified by a rule that no more than 3% of the fund&#x2019;s value can be transferred to the government budget each year. But St&#xF8;re and Vedum&#x2019;s position is short-sighted in the current context. After all, what could harm future generations of Norwegians more than the failure to preserve democracy, freedom, and the rule of law in Europe? In any case, the fiscal rule was created to prevent domestic macroeconomic problems (such as exchange-rate appreciation and excessive inflation), which would not arise if the funds were transferred directly to Ukraine. The leaders responsible for establishing it &#x2014; including former Norwegian Prime Minister and former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg &#x2014; could not possibly have imagined that Norway&#x2019;s government would one day use it to justify holding on to wartime rents. Norway did provide critical energy supplies to Europe in a desperate moment. But in a purely fiscal sense, one can argue that the country did more to support Russia, as its captive market for gas (which it did nothing to create) limited its neighbors&#x2019; ability to raise wartime taxes, while Norway refrained from sending much aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Norway has enriched itself immensely, through the returns on the government&#x2019;s direct investments in oil and gas fields, dividends from its ownership share in its parastatal oil company Equinor, and tax revenues from oil companies, which are subject to a 78% marginal rate on their profits. Refusing to use this war windfall to support Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and reconstruction reflects a myopic perspective that Norway&#x2019;s government would do well to abandon. Despite our reluctance to join the European Union, we Norwegians are part of &#x2013; and dependent on &#x2013; the European community. Rather than focusing exclusively on narrow domestic interests, Norway&#x2019;s government must start considering the well-being of all of Europe. Growing threats to liberal democracy &#x2013; coming not only from our big neighbor to the East, but also from our big ally across the Atlantic &#x2013; makes this shift all the more urgent.

Ex-president Poroshenko may be suspended from parliament for three days instead of six months, lawmaker says	Ukraine&apos;s parliament may suspend former President Petro Poroshenko from sessions for three days rather than six months, Mykyta Poturayev, head of the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s Humanitarian and Information Policy Committee, told RFE/RL on Jan. 31. The Verkhovna Rada&apos;s Committee on Regulations recommended on Jan. 30 that Poroshenko be suspended over an alleged altercation with Servant of the People lawmaker Bohdan Yaremenko. Poroshenko&apos;s European Solidarity party accused President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office of pressuring the ruling Servant of the People party to bar him from attending parliamentary sessions. &quot;As the person who authored this request, I will definitely vote for a decision that will give an assessment. And, if necessary, a certain punishment,&quot; Poturayev said. He added that European lawmakers could view a six-month suspension as disproportionate. &quot;I believe that if it were not for the war, then, according to the rules of procedure, the maximum that could happen to him is a suspension for three sessions, i.e., three days,&quot; Poturayev said. &quot;I hope that maybe the Committee on Regulations and other colleagues will be able to find some solution that will not be about six months.&quot; The European Solidarity claims that lawmakers from the Servant of the People faction have been allegedly pressured to vote in favor of barring Poroshenko from sessions, calling it an attempt to block his parliamentary work. European Solidarity MP Oleksii Honcharenko condemned the move as &quot;outright persecution of the opposition,&quot; warning that it could harm Ukraine&apos;s democratic reputation. &quot;This decision can turn into a terrible story. You are not harming an individual politician now; you are harming the whole country,&quot; he said. Yaremenko has not publicly commented on the incident, and the Verkhovna Rada has yet to support the committee&apos;s decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-may-be-suspended-from-parliament-for-three-days-instead-of-six-months-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-31T08:02:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1065624868.jpg
Slovakia bans Georgian Legion commander, linking him to alleged coup plot	Slovakia has banned Georgian Legion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili from entering the country after the government linked his unit to an alleged coup plot, Denn&#xED;k N reported on Jan. 31. The volunteers-based Georgian Legion, which has been fighting in Ukraine since 2014, was founded by Mamulashvili to combat Russian forces. Slovak Interior Minister Mat&#xFA;&#x161; &#x160;utaj-E&#x161;tok said a total of 10 people were on the list of individuals barred from entering Slovakia. During a press conference, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico did not explain how Mamulashvili could have organized protests in Slovakia or been behind the alleged coup plot. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24, with around 100,000 people nationwide chanting slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe&quot; in opposition to his policies and pro-Russian stance. The protests were also fueled by Fico&apos;s visit to Moscow in late December, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014; one of the few European Union leaders to do so since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Fico cited a photo of Mamulashvili with Lucy &#x160;tasselov&#xE1; from the Peace for Ukraine initiative and Denn&#xED;k N commentator Martin &#x160;ime&#x10D;ka, both of whom supported the Georgian Legion, as evidence for his claim. The Georgian Legion dismissed the Slovak government&apos;s accusations as &quot;absurd and groundless.&quot; &quot;These statements are nothing more than a deliberate attempt to discredit our unit, which has been fighting alongside Ukraine against Russian aggression since 2014,&quot; Mamulashvili said. A similar accusation previously emerged in Georgia, where the State Security Service (SSG) alleged that the Georgian Legion, a former bodyguard of ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, and Giorgi Lortkipanidze&#x2014;allegedly a deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence&#x2014;were involved in a plot against the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party. &quot;Now, the Slovak authorities have decided to follow the same Russian game, recycling the same lies to serve their own political agenda,&quot; Mamulashvili added. The news came a day after reports that the police in Slovakia detained a Ukrainian citizen on Jan. 30 suspected of preparing a coup in the country. Relations between Kyiv and Bratislava have become increasingly tense this month. Fico, who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-bans-georgian-legion-head-from-entering-country-after-coup-plot-accusations/	2025-01-31T07:52:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1241658499.jpg
How Russia profits from arms exports despite sanctions	The Kyiv Independent analyzed leaked emails of a Russian defense company revealing Russia&#x2019;s arms trade after the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The letters confirm that Russia continued to fulfill a huge contract signed shortly before the attack on Ukraine to supply its air defense systems and missiles to Saudi Arabia. The emails also show that India, China, Algeria, Egypt, and a number of other countries continued to buy Russian weapons during the war, despite sanctions imposed on Russian defense companies. This feeds the Russian defense industry with export revenue and strengthens Russia&apos;s geopolitical ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-profits-from-arms-exports-despite-sanctions/	2025-01-31T07:29:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_9812.JPG
Putin clears Goldman Sachs' exit from Russia with sale to Armenia-based firm	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&apos;s exit from Russia on Jan. 31, allowing the U.S. firm to sell its business to the Armenia-based investment firm Balchug Capital. Goldman Sachs entered into a binding agreement to offload its Russian subsidiary, making it one of the few Western banks to exit the country entirely, Bloomberg reported. The decision follows a series of banking deals authorized by Putin, including a December decree allowing French bank Natixis to sell its Russian operations. Earlier this month, the Netherlands&apos; ING Groep NV reached an agreement to sell its Russian assets to Global Development JSC, a company owned by a Moscow-based financial investor. Nearly three years after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western banks remain operational in the country, despite earlier pledges to withdraw. Citigroup Inc. has ceased most corporate banking services in Russia but still holds $9 billion in assets there, according to Bloomberg. The largest Western banks operating in Russia paid &#x20AC;800 million ($857 million) in taxes to Moscow&apos;s budget in 2023 &#x2014; four times higher than before the invasion, according to the Financial Times. Russia&apos;s banking sector initially suffered from sweeping Western sanctions, with profits plummeting by 90% in 2022. The Kremlin has since stabilized the industry by increasing state control and expanding ties with non-Western financial institutions.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-clears-goldman-sachs-exit-from-russia-with-sale-to-armenia-based-firm/	2025-01-31T07:06:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194601867.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko gets himself reelected for 7th consecutive term	Aleksandr Lukashenko has awarded himself a seventh term as president of Belarus, with the West calling the so-called vote a sham and introducing additional sanctions. Belarusian political observer Artsiom Shraibman told the Kyiv Independent that Lukashenko faces uncertain future after the vote. Hungary refuses to sign joint EU statement condemning Belarus&#x2019;s elections, RFE/RL reports. Fifteen more prisoners freed in tenth round of &#x2018;pardons&#x2019; issued by Lukashenko ahead of elections. Belarus &#x2018;unilaterally releases&#x2019; US citizen detained on politically motivated grounds, Washington reports on election day. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) files with ICC complaint against Belarus for systematic crimes against journalists. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself president for his seventh consecutive term after holding a presidential election on Jan. 26 that was decried as neither free nor fair. The first presidential election since the contested 2020 vote was held under conditions of strict repression, with over 1,250 political prisoners behind bars, all but four political parties banned, 1,800 NGOs shut down, and all opposition jailed or exiled. The Belarusian Central Election Committee released preliminary election results on Jan. 27, presenting Lukashenko with a record 86.82% of the votes. Stalinist Siarhei Syrankou was the runner-up with just 3.21%, scoring lower than the graph of &#x201C;against all candidates,&#x201D; which received 3.6% of the vote. The other token &#x201C;challengers&#x201D; fared even worse: Oleg Gaidukevich reportedly landed 2%, &#x201C;constructive opposition&#x201D; candidate Hanna Kanapatskaya got 1.86%, and in last place came Alexander Khizhnyak with 1.47%. The commission also claimed there was a record-high turnout of 85.7%. Nearly half of the votes &#x2014; 41.81% &#x2014; were supposedly cast in early voting, a practice criticized for being vulnerable to ballot-stuffing and other manipulations. No polling stations were opened abroad despite the Belarusian diaspora having been significantly enlarged in recent years. Reportedly, between 300,000 and 500,000 Belarusians have left the country of just under 9.2 million since 2020. There were no credible international observation teams monitoring the voting, as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) received an invitation only 10 days prior to the voting, rendering any effective observation impossible. The head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, and the EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Marta Kos, issued a statement on behalf of the EU rejecting the legitimacy of Lukashenko&#x2019;s election. Western nations, including Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, and the UK, decried the elections as a &#x201C;sham&#x201D; in a joint statement. The UK and Canada followed up with a new round of sanctions targeting three Belarusian defense enterprises and six individuals, including Central Election Commission Chairman Ihar Karpenka, law enforcement officials accused of political repression, and heads of prisons. Canada extended restrictions against 10 individuals and 12 companies. The exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who claimed to have won the previous 2020 presidential race, dismissed this latest election as a &#x201C;special operation to illegally cling to power.&#x201D; &#x201C;Lukashenko, propped up by (Russian dictator Vladimir) Putin, holds 9 million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X on Jan. 26. The exiled opposition held a march in Warsaw in protest at the rigged Belarusian presidential election. The next day, the Belarusian investigative committee claimed to have identified 365 participants in the march and opened in absentia criminal proceedings against them. Meanwhile, the Kremlin welcomed Lukashenko&#x2019;s contested election, declaring &#x201C;Moscow takes no notice of the expected criticism of the elections in Belarus in the West.&#x201D; Belarusian political analyst Artsiom Shraibman says Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is entering a &#x201C;zone of uncertainty&#x201D; as he faces turning points in his relations with Russia and the need to resolve the transition of power amid an ongoing domestic political crisis. Dependent on Russian subsidies and having no room to improve relations with the West, Lukashenko can maintain the current status quo as Moscow&#x2019;s ally while the active phase of war continues,&#x201D; Shraibman says. &#x201C;Putin is interested in a stable pro-Russian authoritarian Belarus, he will keep it that way,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The spending on supporting Lukashenko can be categorized as a military expenditure for the Russian government, so it is not something they will try to save money on.&#x201D; But depending on how any temporary or long-term settlement of the war affects Russia, Lukashenko might face two &#x201C;equally unpleasant extremes:&#x201D; Moscow switching its imperial appetites to Belarus, or losing interest in its client state altogether, leaving Lukashenko without financial aid. Lukashenko may seek dialogue with the United States, potentially releasing the remaining prisoners with U.S. ties. However, Shraibman notes that Lukashenko has little to offer to attract Western interest, given his &#x201C;peripheral role&#x201D; in resolving the war. Repression in Belarus, which has accelerated in the past few months, may decrease in the absence of election campaigns in the near term, but will remain sufficient to maintain a chokehold on society. While the individual fates of some political prisoners could be decided with pardons, Shraibman does not foresee and large-scale political &#x201C;thaw,&#x201D; especially not in light of another fundamental issue &#x2014; the possible transition of power. Lukashenko has long hinted that he might give up power, but has repeatedly backtracked. Lukashenko took his first real step to standing down, Shraibman argues, in 2022 when the dictator introduced the All-Belarus People&apos;s Assembly, an extra-governmental body, and made himself its head. So far it has no real powers, but it is effectively an institutional bolt hole to which Lukashenko might retreat after giving up the presidency. &#x201C;He is thinking about (the transition of power) and preparing for it, but this constitutional framework does not place any deadlines on him,&#x201D; Shraibman explains. At least until 2035, according to the Belarusian constitution, he can hold both positions: the presidency, and the head of the assembly.&#x201D; According to the analyst, another action that might indicate that Lukashenko is preparing to hand over the reins of power would be the selection and cultivation of a successor. &#x201C;But until we see some already high-profile official gets catapulted up the nomenclature ladder, and starts to be painted as a future leader, the only other reliable indicator of the chances of a transition of power is the state of (Lukashenko&#x2019;s) health.&#x201D; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban listens to Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico speak during the joint press conference in the Mirror Hall of the Slovak Governmental Office on Jan. 21, 2025 in Bratislava, Slovakia. (Zuzana Gogova/Getty Images)Hungary refused to sign a joint EU members statement rejecting the presidential election in Belarus, sources told U.S. government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in Brussels. Failing to achieve unilateral support from all 27 members of the bloc, the head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, issued her own statement declaring that the Jan. 26 .&#x201D; In particular, Kallas criticized the late invitation sent to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which prevented the proper monitoring of critical stages of the electoral campaign. She also called for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus. Initially, both Hungary and Slovakia refused to sign the draft EU joint statement, which referred to the elections in Belarus as &#x201C;undemocratic.&#x201D; RFE/RL said the draft statement also cited a &#x201C;relentless and unprecedented level of repression&#x201D; that &#x201C;has deprived the electoral process of any legitimacy.&#x201D; Representatives of Slovakia later agreed to sign, but Hungary, led by Russia-leaning Prime Minister Viktor Orban, could not be persuaded. Hungary has also consistently resisted stricter sanctions against Russia and Belarus, as well as increased European support for Ukraine. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister P&#xE9;ter Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3; was the only top-ranking European official since the fraudulent 2020 elections and subsequent crackdown on dissent. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko released 15 more political prisoners ahead of the country&#x2019;s sham presidential elections, rigged to ensure the Belarusian leader was elected for a seventh consecutive term. In the ten rounds of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; that the Lukashenko regime initiated in July 2024 ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, 293 political prisoners were released from custody. Despite the releases, the crackdown on dissent in Belarus continues, and some 1,250 individuals remain behind bars on politically motivated grounds. According to Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office, eight of the released prisoners were convicted of &#x201C;crimes of extremism&#x201D; &#x2013; a charge frequently brought up against political opponents since the fraudulent 2020 presidential elections. The other seven released had been found guilty of drug-related crimes. The announcement of the pardons, published on Jan. 24, two days prior to the elections, did not give the names of those being released but said that five men and three women were among pardoned political prisoners. Five reportedly have children, and one woman is pregnant. Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office again presented the pardons as &#x201C;demonstrations of mercy.&#x201D; Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in a Reuters interview published earlier accused Lukashenko of &#x201C;playing games&#x201D; with political prisoners. Belarusian political analysts consider the pardons to be part of Lukashenko&#x2019;s strategy to revive relations with the West, which were ruptured after Lukashenko&#x2019;s brutal crackdown on civil society in the aftermath of the 2020 elections and after he supported Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since the 2020 election, over 60,000 Belarusian citizens have been detained for political reasons, and the count continues to rise, according to the Minsk-based human rights group Viasna. Belarus has &#x201C;unilaterally released&#x201D; a detained U.S. citizen, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 26 &#x2014; the main day of voting in the sham Belarusian presidential election. The alleged release follows ten rounds of prisoner &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, which started in July 2024 in the run up to the 2025 presidential elections. The pardons have been dismissed as window-dressing by exiled Lukashenko opponents: while 293 prisoners have been released, the number of political prisoners remains firmly fixed at 1,250 individuals in custody because political arrests are continuing in Belarus. Without providing details of the release, Rubio claimed in a post on X that U.S. citizen Anastasia Nuhfer was now free.. It remains unclear how the release was organized and if any concessions were made to achieve it. Speaking at a press conference on election day, Lukashenko claimed that by releasing political prisoners, he was not seeking to repair relations with the West. However, he also claimed to be in direct negotiations with &#x201C;the United States and others&#x201D; on the matter of political prisoners. The U.S. State Department later confirmed to the Associated Press that Nuhfer had been detained in early December 2024. Former top-ranking Belarusian diplomats anonymously told the AP that the woman was detained in connection with 2020 protests and released &#x201C;as a gesture of goodwill.&#x201D; Nuhfer has no previously known public profile and Belarusian human rights advocates have no record of such a prisoner. However, activists note that their political prisoner records are incomplete, and the real number of unjustly imprisoned is much higher, as authorities harass the relatives of the detained to prevent them from reporting detentions to human rights watchdogs. In the week before the election, Belarusian propaganda aired a series of &#x201C;interviews&#x201D; with journalists of U.S.-funded broadcaster RFE/RL, including a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen Yuras Ziankovich &#x2013; a move that was regarded as a Belarusian opening bargaining offer for the incoming administration. None of the journalists have been reported as being among the released to date. According to the Minsk-based Viasna Human Rights Center, at least 36 foreign citizens remain jailed in Belarus on politically motivated grounds. In total, at least 75 foreigners have been subjected to persecution since 2020 in Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-gets-himself-reelected-for-7th-consecutive-term/	2025-01-31T05:52:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195442577.jpg
Norway detains Russian-crewed vessel over undersea cable damage suspicion	Norwegian authorities detained the Silver Dania vessel with a Russian crew on Jan. 30 on suspicion of it damaging an undersea fiber-optic cable linking Latvia and Sweden, the Norwegian police announced. The vessel, which operates under the Norwegian flag and travels between St. Petersburg and Murmansk, was seized in Tromso at Latvia&apos;s request following a local court order. The police are searching the ship and questioning the crew. The damaged cable is one of several recent incidents in the Baltic Sea that are being investigated as possible acts of sabotage. The Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) reported on Jan. 26 that an external impact had significantly damaged the underwater cable. While data transmission services were rerouted to alternative pathways, some users in Latvia experienced slower speeds. A previous case on Dec. 25 saw the destruction of four telecommunication cables and a power cable, with Finnish authorities suspecting a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel was involved. These ships are used to bypass sanctions on Russian oil exports. In response to the incidents, NATO has dispatched additional patrol ships to the region to safeguard critical infrastructure. While intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe increasingly suspect the damage may be due to maritime accidents rather than deliberate sabotage, investigations remain ongoing. Concerns over Russian hybrid warfare tactics persist, particularly as suspicious activities involving Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden continue to raise alarms in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-detains-russian-crewed-vessel-over-undersea-cable-damage/	2025-01-31T05:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian command post in Kursk Oblast, General Staff claims	Ukraine&apos;s Missile and Artillery Forces struck the command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the Russian city of Rylsk in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. &quot;As a result of the coordinated and precision strike, (Russia&apos;s) command and control post was destroyed,&quot; the statement read. Local Russian Telegram channels also reported explosions in the Rylsk district. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The attack is part of Ukraine&apos;s broader strategy to weaken Russian operational capabilities by targeting key command centers. The General Staff emphasized that such strikes aim to reduce Russia&apos;s offensive potential. The strike follows Kyiv&apos;s limited incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, 2024, when Ukrainian forces temporarily captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. Ukraine hopes to leverage its presence in the area in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-strike-hits-russian-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-31T05:35:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151152486.jpg
Finland announces $206 million military package for Ukraine	The Finnish government has approved its 27th military aid package for Ukraine worth 198 million euros ($206 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on Jan. 31. This brings Finland&apos;s total defense aid provided to Ukraine since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 to 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion). As with the previous Finnish aid packages, the content of the latest tranche is classified. &quot;This package of almost 200 million euros has been built in close cooperation with Ukraine. We are providing exactly the kind of support that will help Ukraine defend itself in an acute situation on the front,&quot; Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said in a press release. &quot;It is up to us Europeans how Europe&apos;s security continues to develop. Securing Ukraine&apos;s independence and ability to defend itself is the most important thing right now,&quot; Hakkanen said. Finland&apos;s neighbor, Sweden, recently announced its largest military aid package for Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion, including 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. The assistance comes amid expectations that Kyiv&apos;s European partners will have to take up greater responsibility for helping Ukraine as the U.S. shifts toward &quot;America First&quot; policy under President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-announces-206-million-military-package-for-ukraine/	2025-01-31T05:18:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2064209173--1-.jpg
Arms procurement chief Bezrukova dismissed, Defense Ministry says after disputes	Maryna Bezrukova, head of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), has been officially dismissed over &quot;failure to meet delivery plans and other violations,&quot; the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 31. Her firing follows a week of escalating tensions between the ministry and the DPA. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov suspended Bezrukova on Jan. 24, appointing Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director, despite the agency&apos;s supervisory board voting to extend her contract days earlier. The Defense Ministry cited several reasons for her removal, including alleged failure to fulfill planned deliveries for the front, poor procurement planning and delays, lack of timely communication with the General Staff, and leaks of classified information, which are reportedly expected to be investigated. Hours before her firing, Bezrukova posted on Facebook that she asked President Volodymyr Zelensky to prevent the &quot;destruction&quot; of the agency. She warned that further disruptions would harm military supplies and erode donor and partner trust. Umerov&apos;s decision to fire Bezrukova sparked backlash, as Ukrainian law grants supervisory boards the sole authority to appoint or dismiss state enterprise heads. The Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment. The Justice Ministry confirmed that Bezrukova was initially removed from the register as director on Jan. 25, with Zhumadilov listed as the new director. Her name was later restored, but with the designation of &quot;suspended director,&quot; while Zhumadilov remained listed as &quot;temporary director.&quot; On Jan. 27, G7 ambassadors urged a swift resolution, stressing the need to maintain uninterrupted arms procurement. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) launched an investigation on Jan. 28 into potential abuse of power by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-ministry-removes-bezrukova-amid-tensions-with-dpa/	2025-01-31T04:40:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01217.jpg
100% tariffs' — Trump vows trade war if BRICS replaces dollar as reserve currency	U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Jan. 31 to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS countries if they attempt to use new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade. &quot;We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs,&quot; Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social, repeating his threats from last year. &quot;There is no chance that BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in international trade, or anywhere else, and any country that tries should say hello to tariffs, and goodbye to America.&quot; The BRICS group, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, has been exploring ways to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. A report by the Russian Finance Ministry, the Bank of Russia, and consultancy Yakov &amp; Partners from last October proposed a &quot;multicurrency system&quot; to shield BRICS members from external pressures like sanctions. The plan includes creating centers for mutual trade in commodities such as oil, natural gas, grain, and gold. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and its allies imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow, freezing Russia&apos;s foreign assets and removing major Russian banks from the SWIFT international banking system. In response, Russia sought to reduce its reliance on the dollar. BRICS members are not unified on the issue. While China supports strengthening alternative currencies, it remains cautious about adopting a common one. India, focused on domestic economic interests, is unwilling to risk trade stability with the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 18, 2024, that there are no plans to create a BRICS currency, emphasizing the need for caution. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated this after Trump&apos;s threats, claiming that BRICS is discussing new investment platforms. &quot;BRICS countries are not discussing the creation of a common currency,&quot; Peskov said. The news comes after Trump urged Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end its war against Ukraine, warning of increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods if no agreement is reached. BRICS expanded in 2024, admitting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates as new members. Putin hosted a BRICS forum in Kazan in October 2024, attended by 36 world leaders, and announced plans to invite new partner countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/100-tariffs-trump-vows-trade-war-if-brics-creates-alternative-currency/	2025-01-31T04:21:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161405262-1.jpg
Stop the destruction of the agency' — Bezrukova asks Zelensky to intervene in arms procurement dispute	Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), asked President Volodymyr Zelensky to prevent the &quot;destruction&quot; of the agency, in a Facebook post on Jan. 31. Bezrukova and the Defense Ministry have been at loggerheads over the last week after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov suspended Bezrukova and appointed Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director of the DPA on Jan. 24. His decision went against the agency&#x2019;s supervisory board that voted to extend Bezrukova&#x2019;s contract days earlier. Umerov sparked backlash with accusations that he was violating the law by overriding the supervisory board. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises.&quot;The essence of the problem is not just an attempt to dismiss me, but the actual destruction of the institution in violation of all possible laws and Ukraine&apos;s international obligations,&quot; Bezrukova wrote on Facebook. &quot;Further delays threaten critically important supplies to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and destroy the trust of donors and partners,&quot; she added. Addressing Zelensky, Bezrukova said the agency had stopped work because of the dispute. She requested he intervene to resolve the conflict legally, prevent the agency&#x2019;s destruction, and ensure the DPA&#x2019;s stable operations without &quot;pressure, blocks, and attacks.&#x201D;On Jan. 25, Bezrukova&#x2019;s name disappeared from the state enterprise register as director of the agency. Instead, Zhumadilov, who heads the State Rear Operator (DOT), was listed as the director despite his appointment only being temporary while Bezrukova undergoes an audit. Now, Bezrukova&#x2019;s name has returned to the register but she is listed as the restricted director &quot;suspended from performing official duties for the duration of the internal investigation,&quot; the Justice Ministry said on Jan. 31. Zhumadilov is listed in the register alongside Bezrukova as the &quot;temporary director&quot; while the audit is ongoing. The removal of Bezrukova from the register caught the eye of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), a watchdog. It believes the Defense Ministry was behind the amendment to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov as the new director and subsequently cement the ministry&#x2019;s control of the agency.&quot;It&apos;s like a classic hostile takeover,&quot; Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer at ANTAC, previously told the Kyiv Independent.&quot;They just want to take over, take the governance and the management (of the agency) into their hands, and quickly do something.&quot;After the initial amendment was publicized by ANTAC on Jan. 27, Zhumadilov&#x2019;s position in the state registry was changed to &quot;temporary director.&quot; It was changed a third time on Jan. 29 to again list Bezrukova as the director after she submitted the necessary documents to the notary.The DPA and Bezrukova stress that she is the lawful director of the agency and previously told the Kyiv Independent that she would not step down from her position. On Facebook, she said that the dispute does not benefit Ukraine. &quot;We should not have any enemies except Russia,&quot; she added. On Jan. 27, ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement. They also stressed the importance of adhering to governance standards.On Jan. 28, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power and office by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/bezrukova-asks-zelensky-to-intervene-in-arms-procurement-dispute/	2025-01-31T03:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01187.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Record wartime private sector investment	The following is the Jan. 29, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced plans on Jan. 22 to invest 450 million euros ($468 million) in expanding the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast. &quot;The commitment is the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the biggest ever private investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; DTEK said in a press release. DTEK, owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, said it had reached a deal with lenders to purchase 64 wind turbines from Danish manufacturer Vestas, a world leader in turbine production. Of the 450-million-euro investment, 370 million euros ($385 million) will be financed through bank loans guaranteed by Denmark&apos;s state-owned Export and Investment Fund (EIFO), with the remainder funded by DTEK. The project is expected to be completed by late 2026 and generate 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually, enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes. The big picture: DTEK lost nearly 90% of its generation capacity in 2024 due to Russia&apos;s aerial attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. Wind turbines are harder to target than DTEK&#x2019;s large thermal power generation plants. The company has also largely been shut out from financing from large institutional investors wary of its owner, Akhmetov. EIFO lending to DTEK could be a signal to other would-be investors. Uklon is Ukraine&#x2019;s leader in the ride-hailing market (Uklon press service)A big sale in the makingKyivstar &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s leading mobile operator that&#x2019;s been in the news lately over its parent company VEON&#x2019;s plans to list Kyivstar on Nasdaq &#x2014; is looking to buy Ukraine&#x2019;s favorite ride-hailing service Uklon. Forbes Ukraine reported on Jan. 27 that Kyivstar had filed an application with Ukraine&#x2019;s antitrust regulator to purchase Uklon. The deal could be valued at anywhere from $40&#x2013;80 million, according to Forbes&#x2019;s analysis. What&#x2019;s in it for the two companies? Uklon has had trouble expanding into other markets, unable to compete with ride-hailing giants like Uber and Bolt. The company launched in Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan, but exited each market except for Uzbekistan. Veon, Kyivstar&#x2019;s parent company, has capital, expertise, and access to other markets where it also operates, one market insider told Forbes. The company also owns mobile operators in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Uklon ended the first three quarters with Hr 1.2 billion in revenue, or $28 million, twice as much for the same period of 2023. Kyivstar would get a growing company, and be able to offer its 23 million subscribers special offers and discounts on trips, Vitaliy Laptenok from Flyer One Ventures told Forbes &#x2014; potentially incentivizing even more people to use the app. A Sense Bank branch in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 16, 2023. (Okondrat/Wikipedia)Back on the market?After being nationalized at the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion over their Russian ownership, Ukraine is preparing to sell Sense Bank and Ukrnafta, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told Forbes Ukraine in an interview published last week. &#x201C;We are ready to privatize Sense Bank, as well as consider the possibility of selling a stake in Ukrnafta, which is in dire need of modernization,&#x201D; Svyrydenko said. Discussions on Ukrnafta are still in their infancy, she said. The Ukrainian government took control of Sense Bank in the summer of 2023 after its owner, Mikhail Fridman, was placed under sanctions in response to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine&#x2019;s government nationalized oil producer Ukrnafta in November 2022, seizing it from its shareholders, infamous oligarch and former PrivatBank owner Ihor Kolomoisky and his business partner Hennadiy Boholyubov. What&#x2019;s next? It&#x2019;s unclear. Selling Ukrnafta&#x2019;s stakes or Sense Bank quickly is another story, as there are no reported serious buyers. Privatization has also been a historically slow process in Ukraine, where many of the country&#x2019;s biggest banks are state-owned, and also in &#x201C;dire need&#x201D; of being privatized. Wesley Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of VisionFund Ukraine. (VisionFund Ukraine)Foreign investor spotlightUkraine&#x2019;s Central Bank gave the green light to VisionFund Ukraine to operate as a non-bank financial institution, allowing it to start lending in the country, the company said in a statement last week. VisionFund Ukraine is part of the global VisionFund network, which provides financial inclusion services in 28 countries across four continents, including loans, savings, insurance, and financial education. Over the past 21 years, VisionFund has lent $12.2 billion through 21.5 million loans. It works mostly with small businesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural areas. &quot;I look forward to working with entrepreneurs and partners in the financial inclusion ecosystem. We plan to enhance entrepreneurship in Ukraine by financing small businesses to support economic recovery and capacity building of communities and help families achieve financial stability,&quot; said Wesley Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of VisionFund Ukraine. &#x201C;We start now as we understand how important fast recovery is and how timely and vital access to capital and inclusive finance is for small businesses in Ukraine,&#x201D; he added. The big picture: Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. But access to capital to grow businesses in Ukraine, where borrowing money is expensive, remains a big barrier for many entrepreneurs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2025. (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty Images)Davos DigestThe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland is over and it&#x2019;s safe to say that in addition to the inauguration of Donald Trump, Ukraine captured a lot of the spotlight this year as talks to end the war gain momentum. An end to the fighting could usher in a gold rush of investment into Ukraine, piquing the interest &#x2014; or at least curiosity &#x2014; of foreign investors. The Kyiv Independent has lots of interesting insights from the forum this year, including an op-ed from Ukraine&#x2019;s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, and an interview with Ukraine House Davos&#x2019;s director, Ulyana Khromyak. 3 key takeaways from Davos from Ukraine&#x2019;s economy minister &#x2018;An opportunity, not a burden:&#x2019; Ukraine House Davos&#x2019;s message for world leaders, investors Davos heard Ukraine&#x2019;s call, but will Europe seize the opportunity? Steel pipe and railway wheel producer Interpipe, owned by Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, has invested $16 million in the development of its assets and new equipment at the plant in Nikopol, Oleksandr Garkavy, director of the Interpipe railway products division said in Davos. Russian forces are located just across the Dnipro River from Nikopol and the city is subject to near-daily attacks. MHP wrote on its official Facebook page on Jan. 22 that the hack brought down its IT infrastructure, affecting shipments. The company is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest poultry producer, has over 30,000 employees, and finished 2023 with a revenue of over $3 billion. The hack follows a large-scale Russian hack on Ukrainian government databases in December of last year. Ukraine&#x2019;s leading private postal service Nova Poshta also reported that it delivered 19 million international parcels, an 86% increase from the year before, as it continues its expansion across the European continent. The company recently announced it had opened its first branch in Manchester, England, adding to its two London locations in the country. Nova Poshta, known abroad as Nova Post, is now active in 15 countries in Europe. &quot;In order to maintain the stability of the foreign exchange market, keep expectations under control, and gradually bring inflation to the 5% target on the policy horizon, the (central bank) board decided to raise the key policy rate by 1% to 14.5%,&quot; the bank&apos;s Chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said in a press briefing on Jan. 24. Air raid alerts warning of Russian attacks in Ukraine by oblast, with the exception of the city of Kyiv, which has its own alerts separate from Kyiv Oblast, &#x201C;leads to unjustified work interruptions even when there is no immediate threat in the area where the business is located,&#x201D; the European Business Association said. According to the association&apos;s members, downtime at enterprises can reach up to 50% of working time, causing disruptions to production plans and increased operating costs, undermining export capabilities. It&#x2019;s unclear how Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force would even be able to change the alert system to target specific regions instead of entire oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-largest-wartime-private-sector-investment/	2025-01-31T03:53:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/_19R5572.jpeg
China is Russia's sole supplier of key military-use rare metals amid sanctions, RFE/RL reports	China became Russia&apos;s sole supplier of gallium, germanium, and stibium, chemical substances needed to produce weapons, including nuclear ones, after the introduction of EU and U.S. sanctions in 2022, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; investigation said on Jan. 30. Ukraine&apos;s Western partners have imposed heavy sanctions against Russia after the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 to cut off key supply lines of the Russian defense industry. As Russia&apos;s options to purchase gallium and germanium from around the world almost disappeared, China became the sole supplier in 2023, the investigation said, citing leaked data from Russian customs databases. Stibium is reportedly supplied to Russia only from China and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that are not part of the sanctions coalition. Beijing repeatedly denied supplying components for Russian military production, but the investigation revealed links between Chinese state-owned companies and Russian enterprises working for the Russian army. Of the nearly 20 Chinese companies exporting these metals to Russia, one-third are state-owned. One of the key suppliers of germanium is the Chinese Yunnan Lincang Xinyuan Germanium Industry, in which Bao Wendong, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, holds a share of ownership. The rest of the shares are held by companies with state capital, Schemes wrote. Its products are reportedly purchased by companies affiliated with Rostec, the Russian state-owned arms manufacturer, including factories that produce optical systems for military equipment. Vital Technology Group is another Chinese company that supplies gallium, germanium, and stibium. Russia&apos;s Ferrotek Nord purchases its products, which in turn cooperates with Angstrom, a supplier of microchips to the Russian Defense Ministry. Chinese gallium is also used in the production of nuclear weapons, as this metal stabilizes plutonium bombs. Russia&apos;s Kurchatov Institute, which is engaged in nuclear development, has been purchasing products containing gallium through Cryotrade Engineering. According to the investigation, the company buys gallium from the Chinese Hynhe Technology Co. Ltd. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has also sough to position itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. At the same time, China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, while NATO has named Beijing a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-providing-rare-metals-to-russia-media-says/	2025-01-31T03:39:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
North Korean troops not seen for 3 weeks in parts of Kursk Oblast, Ukraine’s Special Forces say	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. North Korean troops have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment comes as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been taken off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent, confirming the reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-not-seen-for-3-weeks-in-parts-of-kursk-oblast-ukraines-special-forces-say/	2025-01-31T03:02:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike 'one of 10 largest oil refineries in Russia,' military says	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, in Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. &quot;This refinery is one of the 10 largest oil refineries in Russia in terms of design capacity and is involved in supplying the Russian occupation army,&quot; the General Staff said in a statement. The Lukoil-Volgogradneftepererabotka refinery was targeted in a joint operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). It lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Flashes and explosions were recorded near the plant, though the extent of the damage is still being assessed, the military said. The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast has been targeted multiple times during the war, including in February, July, and September 2023. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 49 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 25 in Rostov Oblast, eight in Volgograd Oblast, six in Kursk Oblast, and four in Yaroslav Oblast. Two drones each were reportedly destroyed over Krasnodar Krai, Voronezh, and Belgorod oblasts. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and fuel depots, to disrupt supplies to Russian forces. The strikes are part of a broader strategy to weaken Russia&apos;s military logistics and economic resilience amid the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-oil-refinery-in-volgograd-oblast-targeting-lukoil-facility/	2025-01-31T02:40:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-31_07-38-21-2.jpg
EU denies any links between Russian gas purchases, Ukraine peace talks	The European Union is rejecting any connection between the possibility of resuming Russian pipeline gas purchases and peace talks on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, European Commission Chief Spokesperson Paula Pinho said on Jan. 30 during a press briefing. Earlier the same day, the Financial Times (FT) reported that EU officials are discussing the possibility of resuming purchases of Russian pipeline gas as part of a potential settlement of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Proponents of the proposal, including Hungarian and German officials, argued that the move could give Russia and Europe incentives to maintain a peace agreement while stabilizing the continent&apos;s energy market, according to the FT. &quot;We are not making any links to peace talks for the moment. The line has been set on this. Whenever we have such talks when that moment comes, it will be with Ukraine,&quot; Pinho said. &quot;We do not confirm any links reported in the article this morning about any links between the transit of gas through Ukraine and any peace talks,&quot; she added. Before the full-scale war, Russian pipeline gas represented roughly 40% of the EU&apos;s overall purchases, with Germany being the chief buyer. The European Commission aims to eliminate Russian fossil fuels from the European Union&apos;s energy market by 2027. Despite the almost complete halt of Russian pipeline gas flowing to the EU, European countries have ramped up purchases of Russia&apos;s liquified natural gas (LNG) in 2024. Previously, Ukraine ended the transit of Russian gas to Europe on Jan. 1, following the end of the contract. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, still rely on Russian gas in their energy system. Following Ukraine&apos;s termination of Russian gas transportation through its territory, gas prices in Europe rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros per megawatt-hour. This rise is the highest since October 2023 and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-denies-any-ties-between-russian-gas-purchases-and-peace-talks-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T01:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189498561.jpg
Dishonest' to suggest Ukraine could have fully defeated Russia, retake Crimea, Rubio says	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced Moscow&apos;s aggression in Ukraine but said it was &quot;dishonest&quot; to claim Kyiv was capable of destroying Russia on the battlefield and returning to the pre-2014 state of affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview published on Jan. 30. The U.S. official acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin carried out &#xA0;&quot;atrocities&quot; and &quot;horrible things&quot; as part of his invasion of Ukraine but voiced doubts about Kyiv&apos;s prospects for a complete military victory. &quot;But what the dishonesty that has existed is that we somehow led people to believe that Ukraine would be able, not just to defeat Russia, but destroy (Putin), push him all the way back to what the world looked like in 2012 or 2014 before the Russians took Crimea,&quot; Rubio said on the Megyn Kelly Show. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for funneling extensive support to Ukraine and pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Echoing these sentiments, Trump&apos;s secretary of state said that the U.S. has been &quot;fund(ing) a stalemate&quot; in a war that &quot;set (Ukraine) back 100 years&quot; and called for a swift resolution. &quot;The energy grid is being wiped out. Someone&apos;s going to have to pay for all this reconstruction. And how many Ukrainians have left Ukraine (and are) living in other countries now? They may never return,&quot; Rubio said. Russia has carried out a sustained missile and drone campaign against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure throughout the full-scale war, leading to blackouts and power deficits. Over 6 million Ukrainians have fled the country after the start of the invasion. &quot;The nation&#x2019;s future hangs in the balance in this regard,&quot; the U.S. official added. Rubio reiterated his earlier statements that &quot;both sides of the conflict will need to make compromises&quot; for successful negotiations. Earlier this month, Rubio paused almost all foreign assistance flowing through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), presenting a significant challenge to various civilian programs in Ukraine that rely on U.S. support, including in the energy sector. Kyiv and the Pentagon said this order did not affect the U.S. military support for Ukraine. Criticizing the previous Biden administration, Rubio also suggested that the U.S.&apos;s &quot;chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan&quot; in 2021 was a signal to Putin that &quot;America was actually in decline or distracted,&quot; leading to the decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/dishonest-to-suggest-ukraine-could-have-fully-defeated-russia-retake-crimea-rubio-says/	2025-01-31T01:35:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
Explosion at Rheinmetall plant in Spain leaves 6 injured	Six people were injured in an explosion at a warehouse of the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall plant in Murcia, Spain, the Spanish news agency EFE reported on Jan. 30, citing local emergency services. The explosion occurred at 4:20 p.m. local time on Jan. 30, starting a large fire that spread to about 2,000 square meters but was subsequently extinguished. Six people were injured, one of whom is in serious condition, according to officials. The cause of the blast is currently under investigation, Spanish authorities said. The incident was not the first to result in casualties at the Spanish plant. Two workers suffered severe burns due to a solvent fire a year ago, according to EFE. Rheinmetall is one of the largest arms manufacturers in Europe. The company provides weapons, ammunition, and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. Rheinmetall also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024, the first of four plants it plans to open in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-people-suffer-injuries-in-explosion-at-rheinmetall-plant-in-spain/	2025-01-31T00:13:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196806773.jpg
1 killed, 35 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukrainian oblasts killed at least one civilian and injured at least 35, including children, regional authorities reported on Jan. 31. Russia launched 102 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Fifty-nine drones were shot down over 12 oblasts, while 37 were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. Three people were injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A 37-year-old man was wounded during drone and artillery attacks against the Nikopol district on Jan. 30. A man and a woman, both aged 58, were injured in the same district overnight on Jan. 31, according to the statement. Industrial and agricultural enterprises, houses, and other buildings were damaged in the region. One person was killed and 18 injured during Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Massive attacks against the city of Kramatorsk left at least 11 people injured, including two children aged 7 and 8. Five more people, including a British volunteer, were injured in a drone attack against the town of Pokrovsk later the same day. One civilian was killed in the village of Ivanopillia, and two were injured in Bilytske, Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 75-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were injured during an attack against the village of Prystin, which also damaged an educational facility and an apartment building, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Nine people were injured in Russian strikes against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two high-rise buildings, 48 houses, and other buildings were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was injured during a drone attack against the Khotin community, and two others were wounded during a drone strike against the Krasnopillia community overnight on Jan. 31, the regional military administration reported. In Kyiv, drone debris damaged an apartment in one of the high-rise buildings in the Obolon district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-123/	2025-01-30T23:42:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-30_18-42-06.jpg
Ukrainian drones set fire to Russian oil refinery in Volgograd Oblast, authorities say	Ukrainian drones attacked Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, targeting an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of the largest Russian oil producers, Governor Andrey Bocharov said. The wreckage of a downed drone fell on the refinery, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, the governor of the southwestern Russian region claimed. According to Bocharov, one employee was injured and hospitalized. Russian air defenses shot down 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the night, according to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. Russian forces downed 25 drones in Rostov Oblast, eight in Volgograd Oblast, six in Kursk Oblast, and four in Yaroslav Oblast. Two drones each were destroyed over Krasnodar Krai, Voronezh, and Belgorod oblasts. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show explosions during a Ukrainian drone attack against Volgograd Oblast, Russia, overnight on Jan. 31, 2025. (Baza)Ukrainian drones have targeted the Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast multiple times during the full-scale war, namely in February, July, and September last year. In Voronezh Oblast, one of the drones fell on a car passing on the highway, injuring the driver, Governor Alexander Gusev said. In Voronezh, a drone reportedly inflicted minor damage to an industrial enterprise. Drone debris broke electrical wires in Rostov Oblast, while no damage or casualties were recorded in Yaroslav Oblast. The authorities of Krasnodar Krai, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts have not yet commented on the attack. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the strikes. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits are a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-refinery-in-russias-volgograd-oblast/	2025-01-30T23:30:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-629598103.jpg
Suspected US-to-Russia weapons trafficker arrested in Kyrgyzstan	Kyrgyz law enforcement officers arrested a suspected arms trafficker linked to a criminal group smuggling weapons from the U.S. to Russia, according to a statement released by Kyrgyzstan&apos;s security agency, the State Committee for National Security, on Jan. 30. The criminal group reportedly began transporting weapons in April 2022, shortly after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began. Authorities caught the suspect while he was receiving a package containing firearm parts, according to the statement. The organization, consisting of Kyrgyz, Russian, and American citizens, allegedly trafficked over 300 weapons, including Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles. The State Committee for National Security said that the network was &quot;uncovered and dismantled&quot; and that it involved smuggling firearms, ammunition, and military gear from the U.S. to Russia via Kyrgyzstan.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspected-us-to-russia-weapons-trafficker-arrested-in-kyrgyzstan/	2025-01-30T22:31:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1164184182.jpg

This number includes 1,670 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,893 tanks, 20,631 armored fighting vehicles, 35,552 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,445 artillery systems, 1,265 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,573 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-837-610-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-30T22:19:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1818488939.jpg
Russia blocked 417000 websites in 2024, media reports	In 2024, Russian authorities blocked 417,000 websites, the Russian independent news outlet Verstka reported. Verstka analyzed data from the internet freedom NGO Roskomsvoboda. 523,000 websites were blocked the year before in 2023, but access was later restored to approximately 106,000 of those. The Federal Tax Service led the crackdown with 142,400 bans, followed by Roskomnadzor, Russia&apos;s communications regulator, with over 132,000. An unnamed government agency, believed to be linked to the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office, was responsible for 62,100 restrictions. 85.5% of these bans were imposed extrajudicially, with various agencies censoring content on topics like LGBTQ+ issues, military criticism, gambling, and piracy. Since March 2024, VPN services have also increasingly become a target, with Roskomnadzor increasing efforts to block them and suppress information on bypassing restrictions. Russian authorities ramped up their crackdown on political opposition following the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Voicing discontent with Russia&apos;s war or Russian authorities can lead to heavy penalties. Russia has used claims of &quot;extremism&quot; to crack down on a wide range of organizations, news outlets, and social media platforms.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-blocked-417000-websites-in-2024-media-reports/	2025-01-30T20:45:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1135694093.jpg
Ukrainian military intelligence disrupts Gazprom's digital services	Cyber specialists from Ukraine&#x2019;s Military Intelligence Agency (HUR) launched a cyber attack against Gazprom and Gazpromneft on Jan. 29, Hromadske reported, citing undisclosed sources from HUR. The group carried out a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, severely disrupting Gazprom&#x2019;s digital services. This operation was symbolically carried out on Jan. 29 which is the anniversary of the Battle of Kruty, where Ukrainian cadets and volunteers fought against the Bolshevik advance in 1918. As about 5,000 Bolshevik troops came to seize Kyiv, a young student battalion of about 500 students dug trenches near the city and courageously faced them in an unequal fight. &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s troubles for Russian drivers are a message from our brothers of 1918, the heroes of the battle at Kruty, who over a century ago dealt a blow to the criminal Russian forces under Muravyov. Today, we continue the fight of those defenders of Kyiv, both on the front lines and in cyberspace,&#x201D; HUR stated. The attack targeted critical online systems, and as a result, customers have been unable to access accounts, process fuel payments, or use other digital services since January 28. Gazprom referred to the incident as a &#x201C;temporary technical glitch&#x201D; without offering details or a resolution timeline. Cyberattacks have been widely used by both Ukraine and Russia during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-intelligence-disrupts-gazproms-digital-services/	2025-01-30T18:59:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1238523443.jpg
IAEA chief to visit Kyiv next week	Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will visit Kyiv on Feb. 4 to hold high-level meetings on preventing nuclear accidents during wartime. The IAEA serves as the nuclear safety watchdog for the United Nations. The agency has had a rotating mission at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since September 2022. The visit marks Grossi&apos;s 11th mission to Ukraine since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the IAEA said in a statement on Jan. 30. &quot;As long as this horrific war continues, the IAEA will remain present and stay active, focused on doing everything we can to support nuclear safety and security in extremely challenging circumstances,&quot; Grossi said. &quot;As the overall situation is still precarious and fragile, our work there remains essential.&quot; Ukraine relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy production, which is increasingly in demand as Russian attacks pummel Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. The IAEA sent teams of experts to monitor other nuclear facilities in Ukraine in mid-December 2024, amid Russia&apos;s large-scale attacks on the country&apos;s power grid. In addition to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, monitors are currently based at the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, South Ukraine, and Chornobyl nuclear plants. The agency has warned that military activity near the sites, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, increases the risk of nuclear disaster. According to the IAEA&apos;s report on Jan. 30, a power line at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant was disconnected on Jan. 29 due to &quot;unspecified military activity.&quot; Other facilities in Ukrainian-controlled territory were affected by air raid alerts and nearby drones. At the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the IAEA teams reported daily explosions but no damage to the plant itself. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-chief-to-visit-kyiv-next-week/	2025-01-30T16:46:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1673593890.jpg
Tulsi Gabbard 'offended' by question about pro-Russian sympathies at Senate hearing	Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for national intelligence director, fielded questions about her record on foreign affairs and past statements about Russia during her Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 30. Gabbard has previously repeated Kremlin talking points justifying the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia&apos;s legitimate security concerns,&quot; she wrote on &#xA0;X at the start of the invasion. During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Senator Jerry Moran asked Gabbard if Russia would &quot;get a pass&quot; from her in light of her past statements. &quot;Senator, I&apos;m offended by the question,&quot; Gabbard said. &quot;Because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about our own nation, our own security, and the interests of the American people. No country, group, or individual will get a pass.&quot; When asked who she blamed for the war in Ukraine, Gabbard backtracked on her prior remarks about NATO and U.S. President Joe Biden. &#xA0; &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war in Ukraine,&quot; she said. Gabbard also dismissed claims that she helped amplify pro-Russian viewpoints. &quot;I don&apos;t pay attention to Russian propaganda,&quot; she said. Senators also grilled Gabbard on her controversial 2017 meeting with former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a visit that sparked outrage from both Republicans and Democrats. The Russian-backed regime was accused of human rights violations, including the use of illegal chemical weapons. &quot;I just do not understand how you can blame NATO for Putin&apos;s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and when Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, you didn&apos;t condemn him,&quot; said Senator Mark Warner, the committee&apos;s senior Democrat. Gabbard defended the meeting with Assad, saying it was an opportunity to ask &quot;tough questions.&quot; Gabbard is a National Guard veteran and former Democratic congressmember who left the party in 2022 and began campaigning alongside Trump. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never led a government department or agency. Trump has prized loyalty over expertise in building his administration, and has begun purging the federal government of independent personnel.	https://kyivindependent.com/tulsi-gabbard-offended-by-question-about-pro-russian-sympathies-at-senate-hearing/	2025-01-30T15:46:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196786617.jpg
Oil shipments on pause at Russia's Ust-Luga port after drone strike, Bloomberg reports	Oil flows via Russia&apos;s Ust-Luga port in the Baltic Sea appear to have paused in the aftermath of an alleged Ukrainian drone attack, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 30, citing shipping data and a source with knowledge of the oil deliveries. A a source in the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine hit the Andreapol oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 29. &quot;The Russians even had to shut down the main pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal in Leningrad Oblast,&quot; the source said. A drop in shipping activity at the port appears to back up these claims, according to Bloomberg. Oil deliveries from Ust-Luga fell to zero on Jan. 29, a source with knowledge of the shipments said. Shipping data indicates that a vessel left the port early on Jan. 29, but shows a gap thereafter. Bloomberg&apos;s source did not provide a reason for the sudden decline. The Andreapol pumping station is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2, operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. Its pipeline network supplies oil to the Ust-Luga port. The port processed about 650,000 barrels crude per day in 2024, representing approximately 20% of Russia&apos;s total seaborne crude supply, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits are a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-stops-flowing-via-russias-ust-luga-port-after-drone-strike-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-30T13:38:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238944260.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 9 killed, 13 injured in Russian drone attack on Sumy	Key developments on Jan. 30: A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy overnight on Jan. 30, killing nine people and injuring 13 others, the Interior Ministry reported. Search and rescue operations at the site of the Russian attack concluded later in the evening. Russia launched a total of 81 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine on the night of Jan. 30, the Air Force reported. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 37 of them, while 39 more disappeared from radars before reaching targets. A Shahed-type attack drone hit the multistory building in Sumy shortly after midnight local time, Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said. Two couples were killed in the attack: A 74-year-old man and his 69-year-old wife and a 65-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, local authorities reported. Some of the injured victims have been hospitalized and are reported to be in serious condition. Among the injured are an eight-year-old child and an 18-year-old man. Videos posted of the attack show significant damage to the building, seemingly between the sixth and seventh floors of the building. Authorities later said that 12 balconies were destroyed in the attack. Sweden will provide Ukraine with a military aid package worth over $1.2 billion, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson announced on Jan. 30. It is Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, according to Johnson. The package includes 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. About $90 million will be allocated for the production of long-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Johnson said. Donations from the Swedish Armed Forces&apos; stockpiles will account for roughly 25% of the package, while around 45% will be used for investment in defense production. &quot;This can be directed towards prioritized needs, such as artillery, long-range strike abilities and drones. A short delivery time is important,&quot; the minister said. Under the new package, $178 million will be allocated for the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production. Other funds will also be allocated for the training of Ukrainian soldiers in 2025, as well as the repair and maintenance of the equipment already donated by Sweden. Lithuania will likely consider deploying military personnel to Ukraine for a potential peacekeeping mission, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said on Jan. 30, according to the LRT broadcaster. &quot;If you ask whether Lithuania could (send peacekeepers to Ukraine), yes, we will probably consider it. There will be a discussion, and I think we should also take responsibility for European stability,&quot; Vaiksnoras told the Ziniu radio. His remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces to Ukraine if a ceasefire is agreed upon with Russia. Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russia has depleted much of its Soviet-era military-industrial stockpile, with remaining equipment in poor condition, independent media outlet The Insider reported on Jan. 28. The Russian military has lost more than half of its available equipment, and unless an unexpected shift occurs, hostilities could gradually fade by late 2025 or early 2026 due to a shortage of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, the publication claims. The Insider reported that both Russian and Ukrainian forces are primarily losing Soviet-era equipment, with Russian losses now accounting for about 50% of its total stock. Much of the remaining equipment in storage is in poor technical condition, making it unlikely to be repaired and deployed to the front lines. The number of combat-ready vehicles Russia could still send to the front is estimated at around 2,000 tanks, 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and 3,000 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Moscow is also reportedly facing production limitations. The only infantry fighting vehicle in large-scale production remains the BMP-3, with 463 units produced in 2023. Modern BTR-82 armored personnel carrier production is estimated at 300&#x2013;400 units annually.

Russian drone strike in Pokrovsk injures 3, including British volunteer	A Russian drone attack in Pokrovsk struck an evacuation vehicle on Jan. 30, injuring the driver and two passengers, the Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported. The Kyiv Independent has confirmed that the driver of the evacuation vehicle is a British volunteer working in Ukraine. The victims sustained mine-blast trauma and shrapnel wounds, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. The passengers have been identified as a 42-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man. Efforts to evacuate civilians from front-line towns in Donetsk Oblast have intensified as Russian forces continue to advance in eastern Ukraine. Pokrovsk, one of the region&apos;s most embattled cities, came under mandatory evacuation orders in summer 2024. Civilian evacuations near Pokrovsk are high-risk endeavors due to constant shelling and the proximity of Russian troops. &#xA0; According to a recent analysis by the monitoring group DeepState, Russian forces are concentrating 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector. The city is a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-in-pokrovsk-injures-3-including-british-volunteer/	2025-01-30T12:42:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/pokrovskdrone.jpg
Ukraine's Defense Procurement Agency says Bezrukova is still director after her name disappeared from state register	Maryna Bezrukova has overturned the decision to remove her name from the state enterprise register as director of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the agency said on Jan. 30. The DPA once again emphasized that legally, Bezrukova remains the head of the agency as her contract was extended by the supervisory board, despite the Defense Ministry&apos;s attempt to override the decision. The question of Bezrukova&apos;s contract extension has grown into one of the biggest wartime scandals in Ukraine, with activists saying that the Defense Ministry&apos;s actions are underminig Ukraine&apos;s crucial defense procurement reform. On Jan. 24, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced that he decided to suspend Bezrukova and appoint Arsen Zhumadilov, head of the State Rear Operator (DOT), as her replacement, overriding the DPA&apos;s supervisory board. DOT is another state agency tasked with providing non-lethal defense procurement.On Jan. 25, Bezrukova&apos;s name was removed from a state register and replaced by Zhumadilov.&quot;Bezrukova has been the acting director of the Defense Procurement Agency since February 1, 2024. These powers have not been terminated,&quot; the agency wrote on Jan. 30, confirming that Bezrukova&apos;s name has returned to the register. The ministry only temporarily suspended Bezrukova while she undergoes an audit, following Umerov&#x2019;s allegations that the agency&#x2019;s results were poor. Therefore, the amendments to the register replacing her with Zhumadilov are unlawful, said Vitaliy Shabunin, co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC).After the initial amendment was publicized by ANTAC on Jan. 27, Zhumadilov&#x2019;s position in the state registry was changed to &quot;temporary director.&quot; It was changed a third time on Jan. 29, to again list Bezrukova as the director after she submitted the necessary documents to the notary.Although officially it is not known who ordered the change, ANTAC believes it to be the Defense Ministry alongside the controversial Head of the President&apos;s Office Andriy Yermak to &#x201C;legitimize&#x201D; Zhumadilov as the new director and subsequently cement the ministry&#x2019;s control of the agency. &#x201C;It&apos;s like a classic hostile takeover,&#x201D; Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer at ANTAC, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;They just want to take over, take the governance and the management (of the agency) into their hands, and quickly do something.&#x201D; Shabunin noted that the private notary agent, Andriy Lihun, who signed the changes on Jan. 25 is a volunteer of the NGO &quot;Union of TV and Film Industry Entrepreneurs,&quot; founded by Yermak, a former film producer. The latter may be the force behind the change, Shabunin said on Facebook.Due to the DPA&#x2019;s vast budget, over $7 billion annually, Yermak likely wants to influence the agency, Shevchuk told the Kyiv Independent. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Yermak and the Defense Ministry but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Umerov&#x2019;s decision to override the DPA supervisory board&apos;s vote sparked accusations of unlawful behavior and calls for his removal. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises. Bezrukova previously told the Kyiv Independent that she intends to stay in her position. On Jan. 27, ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement. They also stressed the importance of adhering to governance standards.On Jan. 28, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power and office by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agency-says-bezrukova-is-still-director-after-her-name-disappeared-from-state-register/	2025-01-30T12:24:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01099.jpg
Kyiv Independent launches fundraiser to support Ukraine's front-line media after US aid freeze	The Kyiv Independent launched a fundraiser to support three independent local media outlets in Ukraine, whose funding was cut as a result of a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. The goal is to raise 40,000 pounds ($50,000) through GoFundMe. &quot;We couldn&#x2019;t just stand by and watch our colleagues and partners lose their teams and suspend their operations while independent journalism remains one of the most crucial jobs in Ukraine today, especially near the front lines,&quot; said Daryna Shevchenko, CEO of the Kyiv Independent. Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days to review whether the distribution aligned with his foreign policy. The freeze affects a number of organizations in Ukraine that provide a range of humanitarian services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. A number of independent Ukrainian media outlets and its journalists who have been covering Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine for almost three years were also left without critical funding. With the advertising market collapsing because of the war and citizens focusing on donating to the army, independent Ukrainian publishers have been struggling to stay afloat and keep bringing the truth to their communities. The smaller, local media outlets were hit the hardest by the U.S. government&#x2019;s recent aid suspension. Many of them are the sole source of reliable local news for their communities. They are small teams working in difficult conditions, usually on very small salaries, driven by their loyalty to the local community. The Kyiv Independent is raising funds for three local media outlets: Tsukr from Sumy, Gwara Media from Kharkiv, and MykVisti from Mykolaiv. The Kyiv Independent has donated $10,000 (8,000 pounds) of its own money to the fundraiser, with the goal of raising a total of $50,000. This will allow the newsrooms to pay their journalists, keep the lights on, and continue their reporting. &quot;We are fortunate to be financially stable and unaffected by the U.S. aid freeze crisis&#x2014;thanks to all of you. We know where you stand, and that is behind independent journalism in Ukraine,&#x201D; &#xA0;Shevchenko said. The raised funds will be shared equally among these three media outlets, operating close to the front lines in Ukraine:	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-launches-fundraiser-to-support-ukrainian-front-line-media-after-us-aid-freeze/	2025-01-30T11:32:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2182628775.jpg
Ukrainian defense tech company Huless raises over $1 million for tethered drone systems	Huless, a Ukrainian company developing tethered drone systems, secured over $1 million in private financing, loans, and a grant from Ukrainian Defense Tech cluster Brave1, the company said in a press release on Jan. 30. Huless makes the Highline-T, a drone that can operate for up to four hours at heights up to 100 meters, even without GPS signals, the company says. Unlike kamikaze or bomber drones that blow up Russian positions or vehicles, the Highline-T&#x2019;s main function is extending the range of communications. The tethered drone stays connected to the ground via a cable that provides constant power and data connection independent of interference from electronic warfare. Huless plans to use the funding to expand its market presence and develop its tethered drone technology for military communications, the company said. The drones will serve as mobile aerial antennas, improving the range and safety of military operations. The private backers include angel investors the Huless team met at Defense Tech Valley, the largest investment summit on Ukrainian defense innovations organized by Brave1. The &#x201C;investments will be directed toward creating an ecosystem of mobile military communications, where the key component will be Highline-T tethered drones developed by Huless,&#x201D; Brave1 wrote on LinkedIn. &#x201C;We are already creating technologies that no other country has. Therefore, investment in Ukrainian defense tech is a contribution to the defense capability of not only Ukraine but also NATO,&#x201D; said Mykhailo Fedorov, whose Digital Transformation Ministry heads Brave1, in a post announcing the investment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-defense-tech-company-huless-raises-over-1-million-for-tethered-drone-systems/	2025-01-30T11:10:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1738237883414.jpeg
Ukrainian detained in Slovakia over alleged coup plot, media reports	The police in Slovakia detained a Ukrainian citizen on Jan. 30 suspected of preparing a coup in the country, Slovak media Aktuality reported.The Ukrainian is being held in the border police office ahead of his deportation to Ukraine, according to Jana Mashkarova, the head of the Slovak police. She did not specify when the Ukrainian could be deported. The news comes as relations between Kyiv and Bratislava have become increasingly tense this month. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky an &quot;enemy&quot; of Slovakia, while Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry called Fico &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; in response. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry told Babel media outlet that the Ukrainian, born in 1966, is accused of &quot;threatening the national security&quot; of Slovakia. The embassy has established contact with the detainee and his family, the ministry said. Slovak opposition lawmaker Juraj Krupa suggested that the case may be trumped-up. If the detainee&apos;s intentions to organize a coup in Slovakia were true, he would not have acted alone and in a &quot;top secret manner,&quot; the lawmaker said, as quoted by Slovak media. Richard Gluck, chairman of Slovakia&apos;s Internal Security Committee who is a member of Fico&apos;s party, said that more information is expected from the country&apos;s Interior Ministry on the suspect&apos;s potential accomplices. Earlier on Jan. 30, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30 to express its rejection of Bratislava&apos;s claims that Kyiv is interfering in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. A day before, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador to Bratislava Myroslav Kastran after Kyiv criticized Fico for wanting to continue Russian gas supplies to Slovakia. Days before, Fico claimed that Ukraine was connected to a cyberattack on Slovakia&apos;s national insurance company, which Kyiv rejected. Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-detained-in-slovakia-over-alleged-coup-plot/	2025-01-30T11:05:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-992281390.jpg
For Ukraine’s female partisans in occupation, hope lies in resistance	Somewhere in the streets of Russian-occupied Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, a woman puts a sticker on the wall. It&#x2019;s a short message, but if she is seen doing it, she will face arrest, prosecution, and likely, torture. The message is: &quot;Soon, we will be home again.&quot; On another sticker, the most dangerous three words in the occupied Crimea: &quot;This is Ukraine.&quot; What makes it even more risky for their bearer is the language. The words are in Ukrainian. The woman putting up the stickers is a member of Zla Mavka, an all-female resistance group. She is on a dangerous mission: to give hope. In the occupied territories, hope is a prized commodity. As Russia&apos;s full-scale war is about to reach its grim third anniversary, its grip over one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory only grew tighter. The prospects for full military liberation of the occupied regions &#x2014; including Crimea and parts of the Donbas region occupied since 2014 &#x2014; seem ever more distant. After seeing the liberation of the parts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson oblasts in 2022, Ukrainians in other occupied areas have been hoping that their turn will come soon. Now they struggle to find comfort in the latest news. Nonetheless, Olesia, one of the three women who founded Zla Mavka, an all-women resistance movement that operates across occupied territories, including Crimea and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, says she plans to fight as long as possible. Olesia&#x2019;s name has been changed and her last name is not being disclosed to protect her identity as she lives under Russian occupation. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; Zla Mavka (@zlamavka) &quot;As long as there is hope, we will continue to resist,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. The name, Zla Mavka, or Evil Mavka, harkens back to old Ukrainian folklore &#x2014; the mavka is a woodland female spirit who uses its beautiful appearance to lure men to their deaths. An image of a young woman, clad in white garb and wearing a wreath of flowers, became the most iconic attribute of their imagery. Mavkas are not easy to reach. Their members never know when a Russian soldier will stop them in the street to inspect the contents of their phones. Olesia sends her answers in writing through an intermediary. Audio or video is deemed too risky. Her responses are somber and free of embellishments. &quot;If we lose, we won&apos;t have a life here,&quot; she writes. &quot;We will have to leave our homes because living under Russian occupation is worse than prison.&quot; Olesia comes from a city in southeastern Ukraine that was seized by Russia mere days after the outbreak of the full-scale war. After Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the lands they seized, hers and other cities under Russian control were to be remodeled into Potemkin villages &#x2014; a veneer of a harmonious cohabitation covering up arrests, torture, and repressions. On Women&apos;s Day on March 8, 2023 &#x2014; more than a year after the start of the occupation &#x2014; Russian troops were lined up in the city&apos;s streets to dutifully hand out flowers to Ukrainian women. The gesture had a different effect than Russia might have hoped. It was the &quot;insolence of Russian occupiers and their attitudes toward women&quot; that inspired the Zla Mavka founding, Olesia explains. &quot;We wanted to remind them that they are not at home, that this is Ukraine, and they are not welcome,&quot; she says. The trio of founders, one of whom is an artist, began distributing posters bearing an inscription in Russian reading &quot;I don&apos;t want flowers! I want my Ukraine back!&quot; and a drawing of a woman smashing a Russian soldier with a bouquet. Since these early days, the movement grew to hundreds of activists, forming a decentralized group coordinated through anonymous chatbots on a messenger app. The group spread to different occupied regions and became especially active in Crimea, with few members hailing even from Donbas. Zla Mavka may be only one of several resistance groups that sprung up in Russian-held areas, including the Yellow Ribbon and Atesh. But its all-female character and the use of humor and creativity sets it apart from others. Art created by Zla Mavka, a Ukrainian all-female resistance movement operating across Russian-occupied territories. (Zla Mavka)Creativity is the group&apos;s greatest strength, Olesia says, half-jokingly suggesting that women can be more sophisticated in the ways of resistance than their male counterparts. Among the many acts of resistance since the foundation of the group, Mavkas say they created fake ruble banknotes reminding the Russians that &quot;Crimea is Ukraine,&quot; burned Russian flags, and filled the streets with pro-Ukrainian graffiti, posters, and poetry. At times, they say they mix laxatives into food and alcohol served to Russian soldiers, a treat they mischievously dubbed the &quot;Mavka cocktail.&quot; Their activities also venture into more usual resistance activities, including the distribution of self-published newspapers to counter Russian propaganda or &#x2014; according to the Ukrainian military-run National Resistance Center &#x2014; passing information about the Russian military to Ukraine. But Olesia emphasizes that Zla Mavka is more than just a resistance group. It has become a source of support for Ukrainians amid the hardship of occupation &#x2014; a community where anonymity is no obstacle to connection. &quot;It&apos;s disgusting, nauseating,&quot; Olesia describes what she feels seeing Russian soldiers in the streets of her hometown every day. &quot;It&apos;s especially difficult when you have to talk to them. You want to say everything you think about them, scratch out their faces, I don&apos;t know what&#x2026; but you have to be discreet and not reveal anything.&quot; The Mavka diaries, vividly illustrated stories written by individual members and published by the group on social media, present poignant accounts of life under Russian war and occupation. &quot;We held on to the last moment but had to leave for Zaporizhzhia,&quot; reads one of the diaries, published in February 2024. &quot;My husband stayed in Mariupol. Forever. My heart remained there, right in the yard of our house that we had been building with love for so long. We buried him in our yard.&#x201D; Omnipresent fear and suppression of Ukrainian identity have become eponymous with the Russian occupation. Ukrainian citizens are denied medical care unless they accept Russian passports. Men are forcibly drafted to fight against their own country. The Ukrainian identity of children is being erased in schools before they&apos;re sent off to &quot;patriotic&quot; military training camps. (L-R) Photos showcasing Zla Mavka&apos;s resistance: posters featuring a Zla Mavka illustration with the text &quot;I don&apos;t want flowers &#x2013; I want my Ukraine,&quot; and a Zla Mavka logo drawn on an arm. (Zla Mavka)&quot;I have never felt so much fear in my life as I do now. Being under occupation, I constantly feel in danger; I fear for my life. I am afraid that they will come for me and imprison me for supporting Ukraine. I am afraid that they will torture me. I am afraid that I will never see my son,&quot; reads another passage from a Mavka from Starobilsk, a city in Luhansk Oblast occupied since March 2022. Even for those who do not plant bombs under railway tracks or report the movement of Russian troops to Ukrainian authorities, the realities of the occupation are unavoidable and deeply personal. Displaying Ukrainian symbols is punished, and people are afraid to speak the Ukrainian language. It is in the acts of resistance, great or small, that Ukrainians find strength while living under occupation. &quot;You feel that you are doing something for which you will not be ashamed to look your children in the eyes, that you are helping, that you did not break,&quot; Olesia explains. But every time, it is as scary as the first time, she admits, using a common Ukrainian saying that translates to: &quot;The eyes are scared, but the hands are doing.&quot; At the time when Zla Mavka was founded, the hope felt across Ukraine was palpable. Not only were Russian forces humiliated in Kyiv Oblast, but Ukrainian counteroffensives in the fall of 2022 liberated dozens of towns and villages in Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts, including the city of Kherson. But then a new counteroffensive, the long-awaited one that was meant to cut into Russian lines in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the summer of 2023, didn&#x2019;t succeed. Since then, the front line has been moving in Russia&#x2019;s favor, with Ukraine suffering a series of painful losses in the eastern Donetsk Oblast. Both Kyiv and its Western partners now acknowledge that a liberation of Ukrainian land by force of arms is unlikely in the near future. As U.S. officials propose ceasefire deals that would leave millions of Ukrainians under Russian occupation, hopelessness is creeping in. &quot;It&apos;s scary. People are thinking about options of what to do if it happens,&quot; Olesia says of a ceasefire that would leave the occupied lands under Russian control. &quot;Many people despair, many are trying to decide how to live (under the occupation).&quot; News from the front line brings no comfort as well, as Russia continues to raze and capture new villages, one by one. &quot;Sometimes it seems that behind all those headlines about territories and kilometers, some forget that these are all people, lives, homes, destinies,&quot; Olesia says. An artwork depicting stories of people in occupied territories, submitted to Zla Mavka. (Zla Mavka)As it&#x2019;s capturing more Ukrainian land, Russia is also tightening its grasp on the occupied territories, according to Olesia. The occupation administration has ramped up surveillance, with increasingly common security checks and more cameras in the streets. Even the initial advantage that Mavka held &#x2014; that Russian soldiers would not suspect women to be resistance members &#x2014; has lost its edge as the occupiers grow more careful, Olesia says. It is hard enough to fight against overwhelming odds in constant fear. It is harder still when hope is in short supply. In spite of this, the Mavkas fight on. Talking about what keeps her motivations, Olesia says laconically, &quot;Somebody has to do it. It just happens to be us.&quot; Although layered with melancholy, her messages reveal a sense of purpose and perseverance. &quot;The power is in the people. Each of us has the power to do something to help this world, from a leaflet to big decisions in the world&apos;s seats of power,&quot; she says in a message from occupied Ukraine to the free world. &quot;We are here, and despite everything, we continue to resist because evil must not win. Please fight with us and for us.&quot; Hi, this is Martin Fornusek. With our team, we strive to bring you true stories of the Ukrainian resistance, of the bravery of Ukrainian men and women like Olesia defying Russian occupation for so many years. We wouldn&apos;t be able to do so without the support of readers like you. To help us continue in this work, please consider becoming a member of the Kyiv Independent&apos;s community.

How two female entrepreneurs from Ukraine are reshaping the fashion industry	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. For Daria Shapovalova, co-founder of the digital fashion platform DressX, fashion isn&#x2019;t just about fabric and buttons anymore &#x2014; &#xA0;it&#x2019;s about pixels and animations. Founded in Los Angeles in 2020 by Ukrainian entrepreneurs Shapovalova and Natalia Modanova, DressX is part of a larger transformation of how the world experiences fashion, taking the industry into the realm of avatars and the Metaverse. The platform uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to create virtual clothing, allowing its users to &#x201C;try them on&#x201D; virtually and purchase the items for their virtual wardrobe. The digital fashion industry is among the fastest-growing sectors, projected to hit $2.4 billion in value in 2024, with exponential growth driven by the increasing influence of gaming, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and the Metaverse in daily life. DressX&#x2019;s creators say their company distinguishes itself from the major players like the Fabricant and RTFKT, which was recently acquired by Nike, by focusing primarily on avatar fashion stores, and catering both to individual users and businesses. Avatar fashion allows its creators to design and customize virtual clothing and accessories that can be worn by their digital avatars on social media and gaming platforms like Snapchat, Meta, Roblox, and Zepeto. An example of DressX&apos;s &quot;metacloset&quot; virtual wardrobe concept, popular among digital natives, features augmented reality looks, on-chain fashion collectibles, and avatar fashion for virtual worlds. (DressX)With most of its users based in the U.S., DressX appeals to Gen Z and Millennials who are naturally drawn to virtual spaces. &quot;The first time (the young generation) see Adidas, it&#x2019;s on Roblox. The first time they see Louis Vuitton, it&#x2019;s on Fortnite,&#x201D; says Shapovalova in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;So brands should adjust, and we&#x2019;re here to help &#x2014; we&#x2019;re here to build the biggest brands in online environments.&#x201D; As of 2024, DressX has distributed over 60 million digital assets, or digital garments, across various platforms. DressX&#x2019;s collaboration with Meta in 2022 in marked a significant milestone, expanding its reach by bringing innovative 3D designs to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, all of which are owned by Meta. DressX has also collaborated with well-established brands, bringing Lacoste&#x2019;s iconic styles to platforms like Roblox and Zepeto, and Diesel&#x2019;s trendy designs to the Meta avatar store. In another collaboration, Hugo Boss implemented DressX Mirror, an interactive display that allows users to try on AR outfits during its events. Lacoste Bitmoji by DressX. (DressX)The journey of DressX founders, Shapovalova and Modonova, began in Ukraine. The two were part of organizing the Mercedes-Benz Kyiv Fashion Days and Shapovalova hosted a fashion TV show. Their transition into tech was a deliberate move that started in 2017 when Shapovalova relocated to San Francisco to pursue a business degree, driven by the idea that fashion is more than just clothing. &#x201C;I understood that the fashion industry is actually more than just a beautiful picture, but also a business,&#x201D; Shapovalova recalls. &#x201C;That was exactly the nature of the show (I hosted) &#x2014; to show that this industry is beautiful, but there is a business aspect.&#x201D; As women and immigrants in a male-dominated tech world, Shapovalova and Modonova are in the minority. Shapovalova recalls attending business conferences where women made up only a small fraction of the room. &#x201C;When you go to a venture event in San Francisco, only about 1% of the audience is female,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;It makes you feel a little different, but it&#x2019;s not like people don&#x2019;t notice you&#x2019;re there.&#x201D; Modonova adds: &quot;We are benchmarking ourselves against everyone else. At the end of the day, it&#x2019;s about the business that you built &#x2014; you are judged by what you&#x2019;ve done, not by whether you&#x2019;re a man or woman.&apos;&quot; Although digital fashion offers a sustainable alternative to traditional clothing, Shapovalova and Modonova emphasize that their mission is not to compete with fast fashion but to create something entirely new. DressX&#x2019;s &quot;metacloset&quot; includes augmented reality styles and avatar fashion for virtual worlds. (DressX)&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not here to fight the mass market,&#x201D; Modonova explains. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re here to create new categories and opportunities for people to experience fashion in ways they couldn&#x2019;t before.&#x201D; But the environmental impact is undeniable. &quot;We have a couple of patents and a methodology for calculating how many resources are spent on producing one virtual item versus a physical one,&quot; the co-founders say. As far as new opportunities to experience fashion go, DressX has developed various tools and solutions since its inception. Through its DressX App, users can try on virtual outfits using augmented reality, while the AI-driven DressXCode fashion game allows them to create themed outfits for virtual environments. The DressX Mirror, an AR-powered interactive screen, brings a futuristic twist to retail stores, enabling patrons to virtually try on clothes. Additionally, DressX offers exclusive NFTs, allowing users to own unique digital designs for platforms like Roblox and Zepeto.

50% of Poles oppose Ukraine's EU, NATO membership until Volyn issue resolved, poll shows	Half of Poles believe Ukraine should not join NATO or the European Union until the issue of exhuming Volyn massacre victims is resolved, according to a new poll published on Jan. 30. The poll conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Market (IBRiS) found that 27.7% of respondents &quot;strongly&quot; oppose Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the EU without addressing this issue, while 22.5% &quot;rather&quot; oppose. The Volyn massacre occurred during World War II. Tens of thousands of Poles were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (known by its Ukrainian acronym UPA) in the Nazi-occupied region of Volhynia, which was then a part of Poland and is nowadays a region in western Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by Polish military formations in retaliation. Polish opposition supporters, particularly viewers of the Polish right-wing Republic TV, which backs the Law and Justice (PiS) party, are the primary group insisting on the condition of exhuming Volyn massacre victims, polish media outlet Rzeczpospolita noted. The poll also shows that 20.4% &quot;rather&quot; support Ukraine&apos;s accession and 14.4% &quot;strongly&quot; support it. The remaining 15% were undecided. The survey was conducted on Jan. 24-25 using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with 1,071 respondents. Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has been one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most prominent allies and supporters. But disagreements in the approach to the historic events have thrown a shadow on relations between the states. Ukraine and Poland reached a breakthrough regarding the issue in January. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Jan. 10. that the first exhumations of Volyn massacre victims were approved by both sides earlier in the month. The issue of Volyn exhumations has become a political fault line ahead of Poland&apos;s presidential election, scheduled for May. Karol Nawrocki, the PiS-backed presidential candidate, said on Jan. 8 that Ukraine should not join the EU or NATO unless it &quot;answers&quot; for the Polish victims of the massacre. Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, the ruling coalition&apos;s presidential candidate, supports Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/50-of-poles-oppose-ukraines-eu-nato-membership-until-volyn-issue-resolved-survey-finds/	2025-01-30T09:56:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1239548149.jpg
Ukraine identifies Russian commanders behind deadly hypermarket strike on Kharkiv	Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) has identified four Russian generals and one colonel responsible for the deadly attack on a hypermarket in Kharkiv, the agency reported on Jan. 30. The attack on the Epicenter hypermarket was carried out with guided aerial bombs on May 25. It killed 19 people, including two children, and injured 46 others. A third bomb, which did not detonate, was later found at the site. According to the investigation, Russian forces used Su-34 bombers to launch three UMPB D-30SN guided bombs at the hypermarket. The SBU identified Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, commander of Russia&apos;s North military group, as the official who ordered the strike. His chief of staff, Lieutenant General Valery Solodchuk, planned out the attack, according to the SBU. Three more officers were allegedly involved in the planning and execution: The SBU charged all five officers in absentia with violating the laws and customs of war, resulting in loss of life, committed by prior conspiracy. Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city located just over 20 kilometers from the Russian border, remains particularly vulnerable to Russia&apos;s guided bombs. Due to the city&apos;s proximity to Russia, Russian aircraft can strike at Kharkiv from within their own airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-identifies-russian-commanders-behind-deadly-hypermarket-strike-on-kharkiv/	2025-01-30T09:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154621713.jpg
Has Chasiv Yar fallen? No, say experts, OSINT analysts, military officials	Reports that the embattled Ukrainian city of Chasiv Yar has fallen to Russian forces have been dismissed by experts and officials speaking to the Kyiv Independent, and the latest OSINT data suggests fighting is still ongoing. The front-line city has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in eastern Ukraine. The battle for control of Chasiv Yar has been raging for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces limiting Russian advances to a slow and incremental slog with both sides engaged in brutal street-to-street fighting. On Jan. 29, the Moscow Times published a report declaring the city had fallen to Moscow&apos;s forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially commented directly on the report, but comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers all suggest fighting is still ongoing in Chasiv Yar. Speaking on national TV on Jan. 29, Ruslan Muzychuk, spokesperson of the National Guard of Ukraine, made no mention of the fall of the city but acknowledged Russian attacks had &quot;significantly intensified&quot; and incorporated some of Moscow&apos;s best-trained troops. &quot;The enemy has recently increased the number of personnel involved in infantry assaults (in this direction),&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These are not only motorized rifle units, but also airborne regiments, and special forces battalions.&quot; Russian advnaces in Chasiv Yar as of Jan. 29 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Muzychuk said Russian forces were employing a range of weapons to attack Ukrainian positions including aviation, artillery and fiber optic drones. He added that urban warfare of the type being waged in the destroyed streets of Chasiv Yar was the &quot;most difficult type of battle for infantry&quot; for both defenders and attackers. &quot;That is why quite often the enemy tries to bypass the city by the flanks, this in particular, applies to Chasiv Yar,&quot; he added. But while reports of Chasiv Yar&apos;s fall may be premature, the direction of the battle for the city is going in Russia&apos;s favor, albeit slowly. The battle for Chasiv Yar has now been waged for months, beginning in April 2024 as part of Russia&apos;s grinding, slow, and costly advances in Donetsk Oblast. After the fall of Bakhmut in May 2023 and the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024, Russian forces overran one village after another and took up positions close to Chasiv Yar. Located on hills, Chasiv Yar boasts the highest point in the area, an important target for any army wanting to gain an advantage. It is divided in the east by the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal, creating a barrier between the Kanal micro-district and the rest of the city. Throughout most of spring, Kyiv&apos;s forces managed to keep Russian troops out of the city. But since then, Moscow&apos;s forces have advanced incrementally into the city, reaching the canal and forcing Ukrainian forces to partially retreat in July.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)The canal became the zero line and the front remained largely static in this area until Russian forces crossed it in mid-October. Since then, Russian forces have continued to make small advances into Chasiv Yar, but according to experts and analysts, are still some way from taking the entire city. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to around 12,000 people. On Jan. 29, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry posted an aerial view of the city on social media. &quot;After the arrival of the Russians, only a wasteland remains,&quot; the statement read. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say that Chasiv Yar has fallen yet,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an OSINT analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group and military history expert, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s an unfavorable trend for the Ukrainians, but the Russian pace of advance has been so slow that it will take weeks or months before the battle of Chasiv Yar is over,&quot; he added. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on Jan. 29 cited several OSINT analysts and Russian military bloggers and assessed that although Russian forces &#x2014; including Chechen &#x201C;Akhmat&#x201D; Spetsnaz forces &#x2014; had made advances in Chasiv Yar and the surrounding area, there are no indication that the city had fallen. &quot;The Russians have actually made some progress inside the city,&quot; Kastehelmi said, adding Russian forces had taken &quot;most of the northern parts of the city.&quot; A view of destruction from a Russian attack in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 7, 2024. (Maciek Musialek/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;The Ukrainians are still defending the southern and central parts, and there may also be some fighting going on near the northern parts of the city,&quot; he added. If Russia were able to take the city, it would have a significant impact on the war in Donetsk Oblast and is crucial for Russia&apos;s larger offensive ambitions in the east. Holding the city allows the military to retain fire control over key supply routes, severely hampering the opposing army&#x2019;s operations in the area. Ultimately, the fall of Chasiv Yar would mean the last Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; the cities of Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, and Sloviansk &#x2014; would be under massive threat from Russian forces.

Sweden unveils its largest military aid package for Ukraine worth $1.2 billion	Sweden will provide Ukraine with a military aid package worth over $1.2 billion, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson announced on Jan. 30. It is Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, according to Johnson. The package includes 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. About $90 million will be allocated for the production of long-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Johnson said. Donations from the Swedish Armed Forces&apos; stockpiles will account for roughly 25% of the package, while around 45% will be used for investment in defense production. &quot;This can be directed towards prioritized needs, such as artillery, long-range strike abilities and drones. A short delivery time is important,&quot; the minister said. Under the new package, $178 million will be allocated for the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production. Other funds will also be allocated for the training of Ukrainian soldiers in 2025, as well as the repair and maintenance of the equipment already donated by Sweden. At the end of 2024, Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent that Stockholm does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-unveils-its-largest-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-1-2-billion/	2025-01-30T08:50:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Pa-l-Jonson-2.jpg
What's behind Zelensky's recent round of sanctions on top pro-Russian politicians, propagandists, energy mogul?	In late January, President Volodymyr Zelensky slapped sanctions on 18 people, both Russians and Ukrainians. The list included 10 Ukrainian nationals, four Russians, and four people with both Ukrainian and Russian citizenship. Among them were Ukrainian politicians spreading Russian narratives for years, local media personalities said to be parroting Russian propaganda, suspected Russian collaborators, a former head of the now-banned Communist Party of Ukraine, and a businessman from the list of the richest Ukrainians. The list included a few notorious personalities. The highest-profile politician among them was Yuriy Boyko, a lawmaker and former head of the now-banned political party, Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, that for years was the country&apos;s main pro-Russian party. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, individuals who have sided with the enemy, and those aiding Russia in continuing the war,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 19. However, the sanctions against Boyko were rather symbolical: He was stripped of his Ukrainian state awards, which the pro-Russian politician had gathered quite a few. There were no sanctions that limited his economic or political activities. For others on the list, however, sanctions included freezing of assets, suspension of economic activity and extraction of resources, as well as a ban on flights and shipment of goods. The restrictions are valid for 10 years. Among those hit by the full power of restrictive measures was one of Ukraine&apos;s richest people, Ukraine-born businessman Kostiantyn Hryhoryshyn, who did not renounce his Russian citizenship. He said that he has applied to renounce his Russian citizenship, but it was not granted because he is also under Russian sanctions and was convicted in absentia by a Moscow court for tax evasion. In 2021, Hryhoryshyn was listed by Forbes among 100 richest Ukrainians with a fortune estimated at $275 million. Now he owns his Ukrainian assets through Cyprus offshore companies or through his business partners, NV reported. He remains a co-owner of Ukrainian regional energy companies. Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, said this sanctions package was likely a response to the public uproar following the resurface of a number of Ukrainian pro-Russian politicians and propagandists on YouTube and social media platforms. &quot;I think, Zelensky himself, and the President&#x2019;s Office, (had) a feeling that some pro-Russian figures had raised their heads, that they felt that the war was supposedly over, that they could start preparing for an election campaign, that they could resume pro-Russian rhetoric,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;This is a signal to everyone else.&quot; The sanctions coincided with Ukrainian law enforcement conducting a wide range of searches and arrests of suspected Russian collaborators, pro-Russian politicians, propagandists, and those publicly sharing pro-Russian views. &#xA0; In just three days, a total of 222 people were declared to be suspects by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and 85 of whom were detained, the SBU said on Jan. 22. Among them was Vadym Novynskyi, an ex-lawmaker from the now-banned pro-Russian Opposition Bloc and key sponsor of the Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He was charged with high treason on Jan. 18. After the start of the full-scale invasion, Novynskyi resigned from Ukraine&apos;s parliament and fled abroad. He was sanctioned by Ukraine in December 2022. For years, Novynskyi was listed among the richest Ukrainians, with Forbes estimating his wealth at $1.4 billion in the spring of 2023. Another high-profile figure that suffered from the crackdown was Max Nazarov, a former host of pro-Russian TV channels banned in Ukraine for spreading pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda. Nazarov, whose real name is Nazar Diorditsa, is suspected of justifying Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine. He was arrested on Jan. 21, with an option of a Hr 12 million ($286,000) bail to be placed for his release. Nazarov has gained notoriety as a presenter at Ukrainian TV channels owned by pro-Russian politicians like Viktor Medvedchuk, Taras Kozak, and Yevheniy Murayev. All the pro-Russian channels, including NewsOne, Nash TV, ZIK and Channel 112, were banned shortly before the start of the full-scale war. Yeheniy Murayev, an ex-lawmaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Kyiv, Ukraine on June 22, 2019. (Alexey Ivanov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Nazarov switched to hosting interviews on his own YouTube channel. During Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, he has invited guests who have been vocal in blaming the U.S. for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Before Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Nazarov denied Russian involvement in the war against Ukraine, Detector Media reported. He called his arrest &quot;unfair&quot; and promised to appeal the court decision. Nazarov&apos;s former boss Yevheniy Murayev has also made a splash in the news recently. In January, Murayev, a former pro-Russian lawmaker, published a two-hour-long interview on YouTube, marking his first public appearance after almost three years of the all-out war. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office publicly warned that the Kremlin intends to install Murayev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. Murayev fled Ukraine in May 2022. In 2023, he was charged with treason. In the new interview that allegedly took place in Beijing, Murayev parroted Russian narratives, blaming Zelensky for Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. The ex-lawmaker also opposed the idea of Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO accession, and criticized Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. Two days later, Murayev was on Zelensky&apos;s sanctions list. Another high-profile person on the sanctions list was Svitlana Kriukova, a Ukrainian journalist and former deputy chief editor of Strana.ua &#x2013; a controversial media outlet that has been banned in Ukraine since 2021. Its editor-in-chief Ihor Huzhva has fled Ukraine in 2018 after being investigated for extortion. He was sanctioned in Ukraine in 2021 along with his publication. Being the publication&apos;s second-in-command, Kriukova has gained a controversial reputation among Ukrainian media observers, who often alleged that she was shaping public opinion to benefit Russia. Kriukova has also been critical of Ukraine&apos;s leadership. After she was put under sanctions by Zelensky, Kriukova publicly denied that she ever shared pro-Russian narratives, and said she would appeal the sanctions in court. Yaroslav Zubchenko, a media expert at Detector Media, a Ukrainian media watchdog, says that people like Nazarov, Murayev, and Kriukova&apos;s public rhetoric &quot;benefits Russia.&quot; &quot;They have clearly, consciously or not &#x2013; in my opinion, consciously &#x2013; helped Russia in its invasion of Ukraine,&quot; Yaroslav Zubchenko, media expert at Detector Media, told the Kyiv Independent. Another high-profile name on the sanctions list is lawmaker Nestor Shufrych, who was arrested in 2023 on charges of subversive activities against Ukraine and paying Russia&apos;s National Guard in occupied Crimea to protect his real estate on the peninsula. Zelensky has started using sanctions as a way to target Ukrainian citizens and entities even before the start of the all-out war with Russia. In 2021, Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council slapped sanctions on Ukrainian citizens for the first time. Taras Kozak and Viktor Medvedchuk, both charged with high treason and financing terrorism, were the first ones on the list. Sanctions were also imposed on pro-Russian TV channels linked to the two MPs, which were immediately shut down &#x2014; NewsOne, ZIK and Channel 112. Viktor Medvedchuk at the session of the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv, Ukraine on Jan. 14, 2020. (Sergii Kharchenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Most Ukrainians supported these moves at the time. Zelensky&#x2019;s electoral rating inched up. The recent round of sanctions followed the rise of pro-Russian activity in the country amid war. In mid-December, Boyko published a video on TikTok, repeating long-standing Kremlin propaganda. Almost three years into Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Boyko stayed in Kyiv, untouched by authorities. After the video, he was questioned by the Security Service (SBU), without any further charges. In 2020, Boyko was ranked as the 79th richest Ukrainian, according to the NV media outlet. His asset declaration showed that Boyko&apos;s and his wife&apos;s total income for 2023 exceeded Hr 54 million ($1.3 million). Ukrainian investigative media outlet Bihus.Info reported in 2023 that the Boyko family owns dozens of hectares of land, thousands of square meters of real estate, and has a number of hidden sources of income, including an energy company registered under his son&#x2019;s name. If four years ago, some observers labeled sanctions against pro-Russian forces in Ukraine as an attack on freedom of speech, there&#x2019;s little talk of injustice now. &quot;In times of war, such sanctions are adopted as a way of protecting your (Ukraine&#x2019;s) interests,&quot; said Fesenko. Shortly after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the European Union imposed sanctions on Kremlin-controlled Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik media. A Russia state-controlled RT broadcast van is parked near St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral and the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on March 16, 2018. (Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images)Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Washington also sanctioned RT. Antony Blinken, former U.S. secretary of state, accused it of being a &quot;de facto arm of Russia&apos;s intelligence apparatus.&quot; &quot;They (European countries) actually did the same thing we did, but later. Because we are closer (to Russia), it concerns us first and foremost. We understand Russia better, historically,&quot; Zubchenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We know what we&apos;re really doing, because it&apos;s not about freedom of speech. We were the first to notice the threat, we were the first to block it.&quot; However, the main difference is the reach of Ukrainian sanctions that now target Ukrainian citizens without a criminal record. A step, the legality of which remains uncertain. Ukrainian law prohibits public calls for the overthrow of the constitutional order, as well as incitement to national or religious hatred. According to the Law on Sanctions, Ukraine can impose sanctions against foreigners and foreign entities, as well as Ukrainians who engage in terrorist activities. &quot;In the practice of our (Ukrainian) law enforcement, terrorist activity is a very broad concept,&quot; said Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer of the Kyiv-based NGO Anti Corruption Action Center (ANTAC). Several Ukrainians on the sanctions list &#x2014; including &#xA0;Boyko, Kriukova and Hryhoryshyn &#x2014; weren&apos;t officially charged with any wrongdoing. The Kyiv Independent sent a request for comments to the SBU but has not received a response at the time of publication. &quot;Ukrainian law enforcement agencies can freely work against Ukrainian citizens, especially when it comes to freezing assets. Sanctions are an extra fast mechanism, and in the interests of national security, it may be justified to apply them against Ukrainian citizens,&quot; Shevchuk said.	https://kyivindependent.com/three-years-into-all-out-war-zelensky-cracks-down-on-countrys-top-pro-russian-politicians-propagandists/	2025-01-30T08:12:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190032907-1.jpg
Ukraine’s parcel delivery giant Nova Poshta invests $43 million to expand network in 2024	Ukraine&apos;s largest private delivery company Nova Poshta invested Hr 1.8 billion ($43 million) to expand its Ukrainian network in 2024, a 35% increase from 2023, the company on social media. The company opened 1,747 new branches across Ukraine and installed 8,410 self-service delivery package lockers in 2024, bringing the total number of its service points across the country to 37,210. Nova Poshta, Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic version of FedEx or DHL, is by far the country&#x2019;s most popular parcel delivery service, operating in more than 10,000 cities and towns across Ukraine. It is widely used by soldiers and volunteers ordering and sending goods and cargo to the front lines. As Ukrainians fled abroad at the outset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion the company followed them, expanding rapidly across Europe since late 2022. It has since opened branches in 16 European countries. The company said it expanded its network near the front lines, despite the risks. It opened 1,214 service points primarily in the eastern Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. As part of last year&#x2019;s investments, Nova Poshta allocated Hr 32 million ($764,838) to open the company&#x2019;s first barrier-free branch in Kyiv. Russia&#x2019;s war, which has caused life-altering injuries to both soldiers and civilians, has pushed the government and businesses to consider investments in accessibility. The 709-square-meter barrier-free branch has an accessible design including a digital assistant, adapted furniture, and automated doors with sound beacons. Nova Poshta also delivered a record 480 million packages in 2024, including 19 million international parcels &#x2014; an 86% increase from the year before, the company said. Ukrainians most often ordered goods from China, the U.S., Poland, the U.K., and other countries, according to company data. Nova Poshta, known abroad as Nova Post, now operates in France, the U.K., Spain, Poland, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Romania, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova. In 2025, Nova Poshta plans to invest Hr 1.2 billion ($28 million) in opening 11,000 more service points and improving older ones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parcel-delivery-giant-nova-poshta-invests-43-million-to-expand-network-in-2024/	2025-01-30T07:46:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/-------------------.jpg
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry calls Fico 'Kremlin's mouthpiece,' summons Slovak ambassador over recent remarks	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30 to express its rejection of Bratislava&apos;s claims that Kyiv is interfering in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. This comes amid tensions between Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. In his remarks on Jan. 28, Fico called Zelensky &quot;the enemy&quot; of Slovakia. Ukraine expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; over Fico&apos;s statements, accusing him of acting as &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; while ignoring Slovakia&apos;s EU membership. The Foreign Ministry warned that this undermines relations between the two countries and damages EU unity. Earlier on Jan. 29, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Myroslav Kastran, delivering a &quot;strong protest&quot; against what it called Ukrainian interference in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. Just days before, Zelensky voiced support for protests against Fico&apos;s government, writing on X, &quot;Bratislava is not Moscow, Slovakia is Europe.&quot; The protests, which kicked off on Jan. 24 under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; saw around 100,000 people across 30 cities demanding an end to Fico&apos;s leadership. Fico has earlier threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut electricity supplies amid an energy crisis caused by Russian attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The prime minister&apos;s friendly stance toward the Kremlin, including a controversial meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December, has drawn condemnation from European leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-ministry-calls-fico-kremlins-mouthpiece-summons-slovak-ambassador-over-recent-remarks/	2025-01-30T07:21:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/679b660ddf43f339020311.jpg
Russian oligarch held stake in Musk's SpaceX through trust despite sanctions, Bloomberg reports	Russian billionaire and politician Suleyman Kerimov held at least a 1% stake in SpaceX through a trust, even after the U.S. sanctioned him in 2018 for aiding President Vladimir Putin&apos;s policies, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 30, citing undisclosed sources. Kerimov, whose estimated fortune is $9.84 billion, ranks 290th on Bloomberg&apos;s Billionaires Index and 17th among Russian billionaires. The Dagestani senator was subject to additional EU sanctions for allegedly supporting Russian actions that violated Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Kerimov&apos;s investment in SpaceX reportedly began in 2017 through Heritage Trust, a financial structure managed by Citigroup. SpaceX was valued at $21 billion at the time, meaning his 1% stake could have been worth around $210 million. Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, is the founder and CEO of SpaceX. Despite the sanctions imposed on Kerimov by the first Trump administration, Citigroup continued managing Heritage Trust, reportedly seeking the Treasury Department&apos;s guidance and concluding there was no requirement to block the trust. Following the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. seized Kerimov&apos;s $300 million superyacht Amadea in April 2022 and sanctioned his family and associates later that year. The Treasury, at the time run by the Biden administration, froze the trust in June 2022 after investigators found it was structured to obscure Kerimov as its primary beneficiary. By December 2024, SpaceX&apos;s valuation had surged to $350 billion, meaning the lost stake would be worth approximately $3.5 billion today. In November 2024, reports emerged that the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Investigation Bureau (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were investigating Citigroup&apos;s handling of Heritage Trust. Musk, who is estimated to be worth $421 billion, traveled to Russia in 2017 to explore potential partnerships with the space agency Roscosmos but did not reach a deal. While initially supportive of Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war, Musk has made progressively controversial remarks about Ukraine and the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oligarchs-hidden-stake-in-musks-spacex-revealed-despite-sanctions-bloomberg-reported/	2025-01-30T05:53:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1232307204-1.jpg
Lithuania open to sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, chief commander says	Lithuania will likely consider deploying military personnel to Ukraine for a potential peacekeeping mission, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said on Jan. 30, according to the LRT broadcaster. His remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire is negotiated. Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot; Zelensky has said that Trump could potentially broker an end to the war but stressed that any agreement must involve Kyiv. While Trump has vowed to resolve the conflict quickly, his aides have suggested that any potential settlement could take months. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Jan. 24 that Moscow is open to talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-consider-sending-troops-to-ukraine-for-peacekeeping-mission-chief-commander-says/	2025-01-30T05:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/lithuania.jpg
Defense Ministry must resolve procurement agencies issues by February, Deputy PM says	The Defense Ministry must resolve all issues regarding the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) by the end of February, said Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna, Suspilne reported on Jan. 30. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Jan. 24 refused to extend the contract with the DPA director Maryna Bezrukova for another year over supposedly poor performance, defying the DPA Supervisory Board&apos;s decision. According to Bezrukova, Umerov&apos;s move caused a &quot;legal conflict&quot; inside the organization, reportedly blocking its procurement functions. Umerov also launched an internal investigation into Bezrukova&apos;s activity at the DPA, which led to her suspension. At the same time, the minister appointed Arsen Zhumadilov, who also runs the DOT, as interim director general of the DPA. One of NATO and European partners&apos; requirements for Ukraine was the establishment of two agencies that would be directly responsible for procurement for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not through the Defense Ministry or contractors. Both organizations are responsible for procurement to meet the needs of the Ukrainian army. The DPA specializes in purchasing weapons and equipment, while the DOT buys food, fuel, and clothing. &quot;NATO in no way takes sides, does not support certain parties or certain individuals, whether it is the acting head of the agency (Zhumadilov), the former head of the agency, or the suspended head (Bezrukova). It does not matter; there are key principles,&quot; Stefanishyna said during her working visit to Brussels. Stefanishyna added that such &quot;aggressive public communication&quot; is not beneficial inside or outside Ukraine. &quot;As a team responsible for Euro-Atlantic integration, of course, we communicate with the team from the Defense Ministry that all changes that take place should be in line with NATO recommendations in the field of defense procurement,&quot; she said. &quot;They were also approved at the Washington summit of the alliance, and I am confident that by the end of February this year, we will resolve the situation because, as a result of the agreements I have at NATO headquarters, a special meeting of the NATO committee will be held at the end of February to consider issues in this area.&quot; According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the DPA for another year. However, the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, recently amended the agency&apos;s charter, so the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are &quot;unlawful.&quot; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the DPA declared that it would continue to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. The Anti-Corruption Action Center also filed a complaint with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. On Jan. 28, NABU launched a criminal investigation into Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-must-resolve-procurement-issues-deputy-pm-says/	2025-01-30T05:02:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166979167.jpg
Georgescu has 'masters in Moscow' — Kyiv slams Romanian politician over comments on Ukraine's partition	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Jan. 30 condemned Romania&apos;s far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu&apos;s statement that Ukraine is a &quot;fictional state&quot; whose partition is &quot;inevitable,&quot; labeling his statements as Russian propaganda. &quot;His attempts to position himself as an &apos;independent&apos; politician look absurd &#x2014; the rhetoric he voiced is identical to Russian propaganda, indicating complete dependence on his masters in Moscow,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. Georgescu&apos;s comments, made in a Jan. 29 interview, were dismissed by Ukraine as revisionist and contrary to international norms, the U.N. Charter, and democratic values. Tykhyi noted that Ukraine remains confident in Romania&apos;s support for a &quot;comprehensive, just, and sustainable peace&quot; in Ukraine. &quot;We remind you that such a development is not part of the plans of the Kremlin and its puppets,&quot; he said. Pro-Russian ultranationalist Georgescu succeeded unexpectedly in Romania&apos;s first round of presidential elections in November 2024. The constitutional court later annulled the results over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok that reportedly boosted Georgescu&apos;s candidacy. Georgescu remains the frontrunner for the rescheduled May election, polling 38%. He has openly opposed military aid to Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania. During his interview, Georgescu also claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump would strike a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he suggested would relieve Romania of its commitments to support Ukraine. Romania&apos;s current leadership has been a staunch ally of Ukraine, providing military aid, including a Patriot air defense system, hosting F-16 pilot training, and facilitating the transit of Ukrainian agricultural products.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-slams-georgescu-over-partition-comment/	2025-01-30T04:56:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
Ukrainian court freezes Russian oligarch Deripaska's assets worth nearly $50 million	A Ukrainian court has frozen the assets of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska worth Hr 2.1 billion (nearly $50 million), the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 29. Deripaska, formerly Russia&apos;s richest man and founder of the Basic Element industrial group and the Rusal aluminum company, was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 and the U.K. in 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine nationalized some of Deripaska&apos;s business assets already in February 2023. In the latest move, the court immobilized a large consignment of industrial products and raw materials stored in the warehouses of the Mykolaiv Alumina Plant, which the Russian oligarch previously owned. The consignment included almost 500,000 tons of bauxite and alumina produced before the outbreak of full-scale war, the SBU said. The seized materials were the main component to produce aluminum at Deripaska&apos;s Russian Rusal plants, according to the SBU. Deripaska owned these assets through a subsidiary registered in a European Union country. The company was a formal customer of the plant&apos;s products, which were then re-exported to Deripaska&apos;s Russian enterprises. In 2023, Ukrainian law enforcement authorities blocked the shipment of raw materials. Deripaska reportedly manufactures products for the Russian military-industrial complex, including components for Iskander ballistic missiles, drones, and radar systems. In February 2024, the SBU charged Deripaska in absentia with financing actions aimed at overthrowing Ukraine&apos;s constitutional order, seizing state power, and changing Ukraine&apos;s state border. Since 2018, Deripaska has been under U.S. sanctions as a person close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who finances his projects. Following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the billionaire was also stripped of his Cypriot citizenship, which he received in 2017.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-court-arrests-assets-of-russian-oligarch-deripaska-worth-nearly-50-million/	2025-01-30T04:00:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1233264075.jpg
Europe’s inaction on undersea infrastructure is a security time bomb	Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, concerns over the security of energy and communication infrastructure in the Baltic Sea intensified. Initially, focus was placed on the threat of hybrid attacks from Russia. However, it became evident that Russian military vessels and so-called &quot;research&quot; ships were actively mapping the seabed infrastructure of NATO countries and conducting military exercises near critical NATO infrastructure in international waters. Why target such facilities? Prolonged disruptions to internet connectivity could disrupt businesses, especially financial markets, provoke public anxiety about security, and set the stage for broader military conflict with the Baltic states. In October 2023, the Chinese-registered vessel NewNew Polar Bear dragged its anchor, causing significant damage to two undersea telecommunications cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. This marked the first such incident. The European Union and NATO responded more forcefully, launching an investigation into the event. Although the NewNew Polar Bear returned to Tianjin, China, efforts to enhance the protection of seabed infrastructure and monitor security were initiated. This incident, coupled with the explosions of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in September 2022, raised concerns about the growing vulnerability of undersea infrastructure. In February 2023, NATO established the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels. During the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023, the alliance&#x2019;s Maritime Command in Northwood, United Kingdom, established the Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure. However, these measures were still in their infancy and could not guarantee the prevention of future incidents. After the NewNew Polar Bear incident, no maritime patrols were introduced to quickly address abnormal activities by civilian vessels linked to Russia or sudden changes in vessel routes. Intelligence-sharing was enhanced, and in February 2024, the European Commission issued its first Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures. This recommendation, which emphasized faster information exchange and stress tests of undersea infrastructure, sought to consolidate fragmented actions and address the needs of individual countries. The Eagle S oil tanker is seen anchored near the Port of Kilpilahti in Porvoo, Finland, on Jan. 13, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen / Lehtikuva / AFP via Getty Images)By late 2024, another incident occurred when the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3 dragged its anchor, severing two undersea fiber-optic cables connecting Germany to Finland and Lithuania to Sweden. During a meeting of Nordic and Baltic leaders, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk proposed a joint maritime policing program among Baltic Sea nations to safeguard their undersea infrastructure from external security threats. Meanwhile, Finland detained the Russian-linked tanker Eagle S, which had been part of a shadow Russian fleet transporting sanctioned oil. The tanker had dragged its anchor over 100 kilometers, damaging the Estonia-Finland Estlink 2 and four telecommunications cables. In response, NATO countries in the Baltic Sea have established an international fleet tasked with countering unusual vessel activities near energy and communication infrastructure. While these forces are not equipped to control the entire seabed of the Baltic Sea, their presence signals to Russia and China that sabotage attempts will provoke a response, and perpetrators will not easily escape the sites of sabotage. It is clear who stands to benefit from these acts of sabotage, with Moscow being the main suspect. However, the question remains: who is directly responsible? Is it the shipping companies employing untrained crews for the shadow Russian tanker fleet violating sanctions, or is it Russian intelligence services seeking to enable sabotage and create favorable conditions for it? Furthermore, with the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to office, questions may arise about Europe&#x2019;s ongoing collaboration with Chinese companies in laying undersea telecommunications cables, which could jeopardize data security. For example, the Chinese company Huawei Marine Networks (HMN) Tech operates a cable connecting Singapore to Marseille, France, which went live in December 2022. The strategic cooperation between China and Russia, aimed at undermining NATO and EU countries, is well known. Therefore, principles to mitigate the threats posed by these countries must be consistently upheld and not ignored.

12 injured, including children, in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	Editor note: This story is being updated with the latest data on the people injured. Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast, injuring at least 12 people, including two children, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Jan. 30. According to preliminary information, the victims include an 8-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl. Local authorities are assessing the aftermath of the attack. Filashkin did not specify the weapon Russia used. Russian artillery and aerial strikes against Donetsk Oblast settlements occur daily, frequently resulting in civilian casualties. Kramatorsk, a key district center, lies about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line and remains a primary target amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive push in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kramatorsk-injures-at-least-five-including-two-children/	2025-01-30T03:37:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/475255784_2091539797986022_8396434578944005302_n.jpg
Russia's Soviet-era military stockpile running low, faces equipment shortages, media reports	Russia has depleted much of its Soviet-era military-industrial stockpile, with remaining equipment in poor condition, the independent media outlet The Insider reported on Jan. 28. The Russian military has lost more than half of its available equipment, and unless an unexpected shift occurs, hostilities could gradually fade by late 2025 or early 2026 due to a shortage of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, the publication claims. This comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has since said Moscow is ready to hold talks with Trump. The Insider reported that both Russian and Ukrainian forces are primarily losing Soviet-era equipment, with Russian losses now accounting for about 50% of its total stock. Much of the remaining equipment in storage is in poor technical condition, making it unlikely to be repaired and deployed to the front lines. The number of combat-ready vehicles Russia could still send to the front is estimated at around 2,000 tanks, 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and 3,000 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Moscow is also reportedly facing production limitations. The only infantry fighting vehicle in large-scale production remains the BMP-3, with 463 units produced in 2023. Modern BTR-82 armored personnel carrier production is estimated at 300&#x2013;400 units annually. The decline in Russia&apos;s equipment stockpile coincides with a slowdown in assault operations in Ukraine, though fighting remains intense, according to the monitoring group DeepState. As of late January, 44% of Russian attacks have been concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in Donetsk Oblast. The peak of Russia&apos;s offensives occurred in December, following a surge in late November. Amid these trends, U.S. peace envoy Keith Kellogg suggested on Jan. 24 that tighter restrictions on Russia&apos;s oil industry could pressure the Kremlin to negotiate. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier on Dec. 29 expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&apos;s team&apos;s reported peace proposals, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact. Putin later reiterated his claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has &quot;no right to sign any documents&quot; in potential negotiations, reaffirming that Russia is prepared to hold talks with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-facing-equipment-shortages-media-reported/	2025-01-30T03:19:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1870879319.jpg
PACE refuses to register draft resolution amendment branding Putin terrorist	The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&apos;s (PACE) table office has refused to register a draft amendment calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a terrorist, Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, the amendment&apos;s co-author, confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 30. Merezhko and other co-authors, including five Ukrainian representatives and Swedish MP Markus Wiechel, proposed the amendment as part of PACE&apos;s planned resolution on &quot;Europe&apos;s Commitment to a Just and Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,&quot; European Pravda reported earlier the same day. After all the submitted amendments were published, Merezhko&apos;s proposal was not among them. PACE&apos;s table office explained its decision by saying that &quot;calling Putin a terrorist is against the rule of procedure because it &apos;insults his dignity,&apos;&quot;Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Table Office is obliged to rule this amendment out of order as designating a Head of State as a terrorist is tantamount to using offensive and insulting terms that are inappropriate in an official Assembly document,&quot; the official reply by the table office read. &quot;I absolutely disagree with such misinterpretation of the PACE&#x2019;s rules of procedure, because the term &apos;terrorist&apos; is not an insult, it&#x2019;s a legal term used in international legal documents, including international treaties,&quot; Merezhko commented. The lawmaker also pointed out that a previous PACE resolution recognizes Russia as a &quot;terrorist regime,&quot; adding that the issue should have been resolved by voting among PACE members, not with a decision by the table office. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, which nears its third anniversary, has been accompanied by widespread destruction of Ukrainian residential areas and infrastructure, heavy civilian casualties, and numerous cases of torture and repression in the occupied territories. &quot;In my opinion, what happened is an act of political censorship which undermines the reputation of PACE and the Council of Europe,&quot; Merezhko said. PACE is the parliamentary arm of the Council of Europe, an international organization of 46 countries, including Ukraine, that promotes democratic values and human rights. Russia was expelled from the body in early 2022 in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The assembly has issued a number of resolutions regarding Russia during the full-scale war, calling for the establishment of an international special tribunal to hold Russia accountable for war crimes and recognizing Putin as an illegitimate dictator.

Russian figure skating champions reportedly on board plane crashed in Washington	Russian world figure skating champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were on board the American Airlines plane that crashed in Washington, DC, on Jan. 29, Russian state news agency TASS reported, citing its sources. The plane crashed into a military helicopter while landing at the Washington airport. There were 64 people on the plane. In the first hours after the crash, rescuers found no survivors. The plane was flying from Wichita, Kansas, where the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and the National Development Camp for athletes and coaches were taking place. Shishkova and Naumov&apos;s son Maxim, who competes for the U.S. national figure skating team, was also allegedly on board the plane, the Russian Telegram channel Shot reported. Inna Volyanskaya, a bronze medalist of the USSR championship in pairs skating, was among the passengers as well, a source told TASS. Most of the skaters on the plane were &quot;children of Russian immigrants,&quot; the Russian Telegram channel Mash reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-world-figure-skating-champions-were-on-board-plane-crashed-in-washington/	2025-01-30T01:58:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196058296.jpg
Romania's presidential candidate Georgescu calls Ukraine 'fictional state,' suggests annexing territory	Far-right Romanian politician Calin Georgescu called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that the eventual partition of its territories is &quot;inevitable&quot; in an interview published on Jan. 29. &quot;On 100% it will happen,&quot; Calin Georgescu said in the interview with journalist Ion Cristoiu about redrawing Ukraine&apos;s borders as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting Romania could claim some of Ukraine&apos;s territories. &quot;The path to something like this is inevitable. Ukraine is a fictional state... the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.&quot; The obscure, pro-Russian ultranationalist achieved a shock success during the first round of a presidential vote in November 2024, making him a front-runner for the second round. The results were annulled by the constitutional court over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok meant to prop up Georgescu. The far-right politician, who has opposed military support for Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania, remains the leading candidate for the rescheduled vote in May with 38% of projected support. &quot;The world is changing. Borders will change... If borders change, where are we? We have an interest in Northern Bukovina. We have Budjak, we have Northern Maramures, the former Transcarpathia... there are still Hungarians,&quot; Georgescu said, referring to Ukrainian regions bordering Romania. The politician further suggested that Poland would annex Lviv, echoing tropes commonly employed by Russian propaganda about a post-war division of Ukraine. Georgescu is not the first far-right Romanian politician to suggest annexing parts of Ukraine&apos;s territory in the wake of Russia&apos;s war. Claudiu Tarziu, a member of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, and Diana Sosoaca, the leader of the pro-Russian SOS Romania party, made similar comments. There are an estimated 150,000-500,000 ethnic Romanians living in Ukraine, concentrated in the border regions. The current Romanian leadership has been staunchly pro-Ukrainian throughout the full-scale war, providing military aid that included a Patriot air defense system, housing a training facility for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, and facilitating the transit of Ukrainian agricultural products. During the interview, Georgescu also said that U.S. President Donald Trump will seek to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, meaning Bucharest will no longer have to provide assistance to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanias-presidential-candidate-calls-ukraine-fictional-state-suggests-annexing-territory/	2025-01-30T01:42:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187159702.jpg
Russian oligarch Abramovich underpays $1.2 billion to UK in taxes, media investigation says	Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich owes up to 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) to the U.K. after attempting to evade taxes on hedge funds investments in a scheme involving Chelsea Football Club, according to a joint investigation by the BBC, The Guardian, and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published on Jan. 29. Abramovich had amassed extensive wealth in the U.K. and formerly owned Chelsea, a Premier League football club in London. The billionaire was forced to sell the club and was banned entry to the U.K. in 2022 due to his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. From 1990 until 2020, Abramovich invested about $6 billion in Keygrove Holdings Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, a network of companies owned by Keygrove and registered in the same jurisdiction invested the money in Western hedge funds, the investigation read, citing leaked documents. Abramovich reportedly made $3.8 billion from the investments. The central figure in the scheme was said to be Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire and Chelsea&apos;s former director. Shvidler is currently under sanctions due to his ties to Abramovich. The directors of the companies registered in the British Virgin Islands allegedly gave Schwiller broad powers to manage them. He then lived in the U.K. and became a British citizen in 2010. If companies are run by a person based in the U.K., profits should be taxed as if they were a U.K. company, the BBC wrote. Beginning in 2008, Shvidler was authorized to manage Keygrove&apos;s investments, which owned companies in the British Virgin Islands, through another company, the investigation read. According to the leaked documents, significant amounts of tax-free profits from Abramovich&apos;s hedge fund investments flowed through a network of companies before ending up at FC Chelsea. Thus, the hedge fund investments flowed back to British Virgin Islands companies and Keygrove. Keygrove then loaned money to other Abramovich companies, which then lent money to Camberley International Investments Ltd, the company set up to finance Chelsea. The article came as part of the joint Cyprus Confidential investigation into files leaked in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Paper Trail Media. Previously, the first part of the investigation by the BBC, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and The Guardian revealed that the Cypriot company Blue Ocean Yacht Management, owned by Abramovich, created a fictitious business of renting superyachts used by the entrepreneur himself to evade taxes. From 2005 to 2012, Abramovich did not pay tens of millions of euros in taxes in this way, according to journalists. Abramovich&apos;s net worth is estimated to be around $9 billion, and he has Russian, Israeli, and Portuguese citizenship. He and other top Russian oligarchs were sanctioned after the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The oligarch now resides alternatively in Tel Aviv, Istanbul, and Russia&apos;s Sochi.	https://kyivindependent.com/abramovich-owes-billion-to-uk-in-taxes-media-says/	2025-01-30T00:49:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-630266674.jpg
8 killed, 26 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured at least 26, including a child and three medical workers, regional authorities reported on Jan. 30. Russia launched 81 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Thirty-seven were shot down over 10 oblasts, while 39 were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy in Sumy Oblast overnight on Jan. 30, killing four people and injuring at least nine others, local authorities reported. A 7-year-old child was injured, as well as an 18-year-old man. In the same region, a civilian was injured during a drone attack against the Hlukhiv community on Jan. 29, authorities said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed one person in Siversk, injured two in Pokrovsk, and two others in Bilytske, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. A Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack injured three medical workers in the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 43-year-old ambulance driver, a 26-year-old doctor, and a 41-year-old medic were injured after the drone struck close to the vehicle. Three people were killed and 10 injured as a result of Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three apartment buildings and 22 houses were damaged. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian attacks against the Synelnykove district destroyed a school, damaged a cultural center, a religious building, an administrative building, a post office, a shop, a company building, and 22 houses, Governor Serhii Lysak said. No casualties were reported. Russian drones also attacked the Izmail district in Odesa Oblast, damaging a grain warehouse, a hospital, two houses, and cars but inflicting no casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-killed-26-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-01-29T23:41:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-30_08-34-51.jpg
EU debates restarting Russian gas purchases as part of Ukraine peace deal, FT reports	EU officials are discussing the option of resuming purchases of Russian pipeline gas as part of a potential settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 30, citing undisclosed sources. The proposal&apos;s advocates, including Hungarian and German officials, argue that the move could give both Russia and Europe incentives to maintain a peace deal while stabilizing the continent&apos;s energy market, the outlet wrote. The news comes almost a month after Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas through its territory to the EU, putting an end to a scheme dating back to Soviet times. The decision has sparked protests from some EU members &#x2014; Slovakia and Hungary &#x2014; who continue to rely on Russian gas despite the bloc&apos;s efforts at diversifying supplies. According to the FT, the proposal to resume Russian gas purchases has faced backlash from Ukraine&apos;s chief allies within the EU and officials from some &quot;eastern&quot; member states. While most of the Russian pipeline gas flow to Europe came to a halt, European countries continue to buy Russian liquified natural gas (LNG). The TurkStream line remains the last operational pipeline connection funneling Russian gas to the EU. Earlier this week, Hungary announced it had received &quot;requested guarantees&quot; from the EU on securing energy transit to European countries after threatening to veto sanctions against Moscow. Shortly after, Reuters reported that the European Commission will continue leading talks on gas supplies with Ukraine, Slovakia, and Hungary. Before the full-scale war, Russian pipeline gas represented roughly 40% of the EU&apos;s overall purchases, with Germany being the chief buyer. Fossil fuel exports represent a key portion of Russia&apos;s state revenue and help fuel Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, leading to calls among Kyiv&apos;s partners to phase out the purchases completely. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gas imports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027. U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to broker a peace settlement in Ukraine, urged Europe to purchase more American LNG and called for increasing oil production to push down the prices and stifle Russia&apos;s revenues, thus forcing it to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-mulls-restarting-russian-gas-purchases-as-part-of-ukraine-peace-deal-ft-reports/	2025-01-29T22:54:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1246203218.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 835,940 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 835,940 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 30. This number includes 1,270 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,890 tanks, 20,614 armored fighting vehicles, 35,451 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,412 artillery systems, 1,264 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,510 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-835-940-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-29T22:21:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_16453-1.jpg
Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa named transitional president	Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of the main rebel group who led the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, has been named Syria&apos;s transitional president, the country&apos;s military command announced on Jan. 29. &#x201C;We announce the appointment of Commander Ahmad al-Sharaa as head of state during the transitional period. He will assume the duties of the president of the Syrian Arab Republic and represent the country in international forums,&#x201D; the Syria Military Operations Command said in a statement. &#x201C;The president is authorized to form a temporary legislative council for the transitional phase, which will carry out its duties until a permanent constitution is enacted and put into effect,&#x201D; the statement added. Once a member of al Qaeda, al-Sharaa&apos;s rebel group broke away from the terrorist organization in 2016 to help lead efforts to oust Assad during the country&apos;s decade-long civil war. Given al-Sharaa&apos;s past ties, Western officials have remained cautious about the transitional president&apos;s intentions as he attempts to rebuild a war-torn society. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X on Jan. 27, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria.&quot; Al-Sharaa, who has served as the country&apos;s de-facto leader since the fall of Assad in December, has distanced the country from its previous ties with Russia &#x2014; including blocking the withdrawal of Russian military equipment, demanding compensation from Russia for the country&apos;s &quot;past mistakes&quot; in Syria, and calling on the Kremlin to hand over Assad from Russian asylum. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 for a meeting with al-Sharaa, in which Sybiha expressed Ukraine holds a &quot;similar view&quot; on Russian military presence in Syria. During his visit, Sybiha emphasized that Ukraine is ready to restore diplomatic ties, trade, and educational exchanges with Syria if the country&apos;s new leadership respects international law and its territorial integrity.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrian-rebel-leader-ahmad-al-sharaa-named-transitional-president/	2025-01-29T20:35:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000495.jpg
EU not considering banning Russian LNG until it secures alternatives, Reuters reports	The European Commission will not propose implementing a ban on Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) imports in its upcoming sanctions package amid concern among member states about first securing an alternative from other countries, including the United States, EU diplomats told Reuters on Jan. 29. Following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe began to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels to avoid financing the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. Despite these efforts, Europe&apos;s imports of Russian LNG, which is largely not subject to sanctions, have soared to record levels in 2024. &quot;First you have to have a deal because otherwise you will be left without gas from Russia and without the U.S.,&quot; one diplomat told Reuters. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested replacing Russian LNG with U.S. exports in a phone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 8. On Jan. 23, Trump said he would guarantee supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe, although he did not provide a timeline or specify the amount of exports. &quot;The general idea was floated by the Commission in confessionals in order to test the waters... Apparently one or more member (states) signalled enough opposition for the Commission not to deem it opportune to propose such a measure now,&quot; another European diplomat told Reuters. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials, that the EU was considering a gradual ban on Russian LNG, but eventually settled on proposing new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions. On Jan 28, the Financial Times (FT) reported, citing a report by Belgian, German, and Ukrainian NGOs, that German imports of Russian LNG via other EU countries continue to rise despite restrictions on direct shipments. According to FT, Belgium, Spain, and France receive Russian LNG cargos, which they later re-export to other countries. This makes it difficult to trace the origin and allows Germany to import Russian LNG even after banning its ports from receiving Russian LNG shipments. The European Union imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June. Russia still remains Europe&apos;s second-largest importer of LNG, after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-not-considering-banning-russian-lng-until-it-secures-alternatives-reuters-reports/	2025-01-29T18:54:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1259161176.jpg
Russian drone attack on residential building in Sumy injures 7, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy overnight on Jan. 30, injuring at least seven people, local authorities reported. Conflicting reports by local officials initially indicated that one person was killed in the attack, although the Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reports. A Shahed-type attack drone hit a multistory building in the city, Acting Regional Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said. During the strike a 7-year-old child was injured, as well as an 18-year-old man. No additional information was provided as to the identity of the remaining victims. Emergency rescue workers are currently on-scene, searching for potentially more victims under the rubble. Some of the injured victims have been hospitalized and are reported to be in serious condition. Videos posted of the attack show significant damage to the building, seemingly between the sixth and seventh floors of the building. Situated on the Ukraine-Russia border, the city of Sumy and surrounding region have continuously come under attack since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Throughout the day on Jan. 29, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported 106 separate attacks on the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-sumy-kills-1-injures-3-including-child/	2025-01-29T17:36:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000490.jpg
Georgia withdraws from PACE, calls demands for new elections 'blackmail'	Georgia withdrew its delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Jan. 29 after the Assembly passed a resolution calling for Tbilisi to hold new parliamentary elections. The country&apos;s fall 2024 parliamentary elections sparked mass protests and political turmoil, with the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party declaring a sweeping victory as opposition groups and international monitors pointed to evidence of widespread fraud. PACE on Jan. 29 adopted a resolution calling on the Georgian government to hold &quot;new genuinely democratic parliamentary elections,&quot; Assembly President Theodoros Rousopoulos said in a statement. The resolution stipulated that the credentials of the Georgian delegates would be reviewed and potentially revoked if the government did not take these measures. PACE had previously ratified the Georgian delegation&apos;s credentials, but suspended some of the members&apos; rights due to evidence of &quot;democratic backsliding.&quot; The new resolution applies conditions for the future ratification of Georgia&apos;s credentials. Besides new elections, the resolution also calls for the release of all political prisoners and immediate steps to resume the process of Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union. In response to the vote, Georgia announced the withdrawal of its delegates from PACE. &quot;We believe that as long as the completely unjust and unfounded blackmail against the government elected by the Georgian people continues ... the participation of our parliamentary delegation in the Assembly has no meaning or justification,&quot; Teia Tsulukiani, the head of the Georgian parliamentary delegation, said in a statement to reporters. Georgia remains a member of the Council of Europe but will not resume work with PACE until &quot;the blackmail ends&quot; and the Assembly &quot;changes its unfair attitude towards the Georgian state,&quot; Tsulukiani said. PACE President Rousopoulos said he regretted the delegation&apos;s decision. &quot;I regret the decision of the Georgian delegation to withdraw from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe following the Assembly&apos;s vote tonight to ratify the delegation&apos;s credentials, subject to conditions,&quot; Rousopoulos said. &quot;This jeopardizes the dialogue that could help to advance democratic standards in Georgia.&quot; Under the leadership of the ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, Tbilisi has moved closer to Russia and stalled its accession to the EU. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced in November 2024 that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. The statement kicked off a fresh round of demonstrations across the country. Georgia has incurred sanctions, including visa restrictions, from the U.S., E.U., and Ukraine due to its apparent anti-democratic trajectory. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-withdraws-from-pace-calls-demands-for-new-elections-blackmail/	2025-01-29T15:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/PACEGeorgia.png
NATO on track to send Kyiv over $40 billion in 2025	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is on course to fulfill its promise to send approximately $41.6 billion (40 billion euros) in security assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year, NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska said on Jan. 29. Member nations pledged to provide the funding to Ukraine during the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. in July 2024. Shekerinska discussed the status of the funds during a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council in Brussels. Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna attended the meeting. &quot;Allies are on track to deliver on the pledge made at the Washington summit,&quot; a NATO press statement said. Stefanishyna also met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte during her visit to Brussels. Their discussions centered on the current situation on the front lines, Ukraine&apos;s ongoing reform efforts, and continued NATO support for Ukraine&apos;s defense. Rutte has pledged to maintain the alliance&apos;s support for Kyiv and increase Europe&apos;s share of the spending amid the U.S. government transition. NATO has already moved into a new leadership position in coordinating aid for Ukraine, taking over certain responsibilities once handled by the U.S. The future of U.S. military aid remains uncertain under President Donald Trump, who has urged Europe to shoulder more of the financial burden. Ukraine continues to prioritize its future NATO membership as an essential security guarantee in the face of Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-on-track-to-send-kyiv-over-40-billion-in-2025/	2025-01-29T14:35:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/nato.jpeg
