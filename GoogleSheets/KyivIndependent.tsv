North Korean soldiers sent to Ukrainian border equipped with standard infantry weapons, military intelligence says	Russia has armed North Korean troops deployed near the border with Ukraine with infantry weapons, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 2. According to HUR, North Korean soldiers received 60-mm mortars, AK-12 rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, Feniks anti-tank guided missiles, and hand-held anti-tank grenade launchers. They also reportedly received some night vision devices, thermal imagers, collimator sights, and binoculars. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. Russia deployed more than 7,000 North Korean troops from Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai to the Ukrainian border, the agency said. These numbers almost coincide with those of Washington&apos;s announced earlier this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that some 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, HUR reported. Soldiers are reportedly currently undergoing training at five military camps in the Russian Far East. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-sent-to-ukrainian-border-equipped-with-standard-infantry-weapons-military-intelligence-says/	2024-11-02T02:03:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 697,680 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 697,680 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 2. This number includes 1,270 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,170 tanks, 18,487 armored fighting vehicles, 28,114 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,076 artillery systems, 1,244 multiple launch rocket systems, 994 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,117 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-697-680-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-02T00:50:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1243747572.jpg
Russia targets Kyiv overnight on Nov. 2, damages apartment building	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone strike on Kyiv&#x2019;s Sviatoshynskyi district overnight on Nov. 2 caused a fire in a 16-story residential building, injuring two people and causing damage to upper floors. The blaze, which broke out on the upper floors, spread across an area of roughly 50 square meters, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged several apartments on the building&#x2019;s 15th and 16th floors, with the top floor suffering the most severe destruction. First responders evacuated 18 residents, according to local authorities. One of the injured was transfered to the local hospital, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. The Nov. 2 attack is the latest in a series of drone strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital. On Oct. 29, Russia attacked Kyiv with drones injuring six people in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district, authorities reported. Air defense remains active in Kyiv as of 7:45 a.m. local time. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force earlier warned about drone threats to the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-targets-kyiv-overnight-on-nov-2-damages-apartment-building/	2024-11-01T22:55:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01-23_48_13.jpeg
Russia imprisons former US consulate employee for ‘secret collaboration with foreign state’	A Russian court on Nov. 1 sentenced Robert Shonov, a former employee of the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok, to four years and 10 months in prison for &quot;secret collaboration with a foreign state.&quot; Shonov, a Russian national who worked at the consulate for over 25 years until 2021, became a private contractor after Moscow restricted local staff from working at foreign missions, gathering public Russian media reports for the U.S., according to the U.S. State Department. Shonov was detained in 2023, accused of passing information on Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine to the U.S. in exchange for payment. Primorye&#x2019;s regional court disclosed that 400,000 roubles ($4,100) and an electronic device were confiscated as part of the investigation. In September, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats, alleging they served as intermediaries for Shonov. The U.S. State Department defended Shonov&#x2019;s activities as lawful, saying he &quot;worked as a private contractor compiling press accounts from publicly accessible Russian media, in strict compliance with Russia&#x2019;s laws and regulations.&quot; Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the allegations against Mr. Shonov &quot;are wholly without merit.&quot; This incident adds to a series of U.S. nationals arrested in Russia, with several now serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. Washington, a key backer of Ukraine against Russian forces, accuses Moscow of seeking prisoner swaps for Russians held in the U.S. Though the U.S. and Russia executed a notable prisoner swap in August that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, several American and dual-national detainees remain in Russian custody.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-imprisons-former-us-consulate-employee-for-secret-collaboration-with-foreign-state/	2024-11-01T21:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Georgia election results indicate possible manipulation, two US pollsters say	Two U.S. pollsters, commissioned by Georgian opposition forces, are questioning the official results of the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which declared the ruling Georgian Dream party victorious. Opposition parties are organizing another protest next week to contest these results. Edison Research, hired by the pro-opposition Formula TV, highlighted significant differences between its exit poll and the official count, suggesting &quot;manipulation&quot; of the vote. Another U.S. pollster, HarrisX, which conducted an exit poll for pro-opposition Mtavari Arkhi, described the official results as &quot;statistically impossible,&quot; Reuters reported. This election is critical for Georgia&apos;s future direction, with voters choosing between a pro-Western opposition advocating for European integration and the Georgian Dream party, which leans toward Moscow and faces accusations of authoritarianism. Election observer groups like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) reported incidents of ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and bribery, though they stopped short of declaring the election stolen. Russia has denied any interference. Both Edison and HarrisX had projected a parliamentary majority for Georgia&#x2019;s four main opposition parties. However, a separate exit poll from Georgian pollster GORBI, commissioned by pro-government Imedi TV, predicted Georgian Dream would win with 56% of the vote. Thousands protested in Tbilisi after the election, with more demonstrations planned, while Georgia&#x2019;s pro-Western president condemned the election as fraudulent. Edison&apos;s exit poll suggested Georgian Dream took only 41% of the vote, 13 points below the official count of 54%. &quot;The 13-point difference between Edison&#x2019;s estimate and the official result... cannot be explained by normal variation alone and suggests local-level manipulation of the vote,&quot; Edison&apos;s Executive Vice President Rob Farbman said in a statement. Edison&#x2019;s review found that the deviation from statistically expected results was widespread but most pronounced at specific polling locations in rural areas. In urban areas, Georgian Dream underperformed, while in rural areas, it reportedly achieved margins as high as 90%. Georgian state prosecutors, under Western pressure, announced a probe into allegations of election falsification.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-election-results-indicate-possible-manipulation-two-us-pollsters-say/	2024-11-01T19:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180900026.jpg
Ukraine launches 5G pilot project	Ukraine is launching a 5G pilot project in three cities to test the network&apos;s compatibility with military technology, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Nov. 1. 5G, the fifth-generation cellular network technology, offers significantly faster data-transmission speeds than its predecessor, 4G. The Ukrainian government has amended the resolution on the use of radio frequencies, paving the way for the country to test 5G technology, according to Fedorov. The two-year pilot program will cover three cities and include two stages, he said. The National Cybersecurity Coordination Center (NCCC) and Ukrainian State Center for Radio Frequencies will partner to test whether or not 5G equipment interferes with military networks. &quot;5G is capable of transmitting data 10 times faster than 4G, so it creates new opportunities for exchanging large amounts of information at ultra-high speeds,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;This is one of the key steps towards the full launch of 5G in Ukraine, which we plan to complete by 2030.&quot; Fedorov said the launch of 5G could provide more flexibility to operators and ensure the development of high-quality telecommunications despite the pressures of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fedorov did not identify the three cities that would participate in the pilot program.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launches-5g-pilot-project/	2024-11-01T17:15:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/30_8_GLOBSEC_FEDOROV_KI-2.jpg
World 'merely watching' as North Korea threat grows, Zelensky warns	The international community is &quot;merely watching&quot; as the threat of North Korean military aggression grows, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a social media post on Nov. 1. Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. The president&apos;s warning follows reports that 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Kursk Oblast and preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces in the coming days. &quot;North Korea has tested a new ballistic missile just yesterday, achieving record time and sufficient altitude,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;Yet the world is just watching, observing as this threat grows.&quot; Pyongyang&apos;s cooperation with Moscow has enabled improvements in North Korean military technology that are &quot;already evident,&quot; he said. With North Korean troops joining Russia on the battlefield, Pyongyang will also have the opportunity to learn the tactics of &quot;modern warfare.&quot; &#xA0; &quot;The first thousands of North Korean soldiers are already near Ukraine&apos;s borders, and Ukrainians will be forced to defend themselves against them,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine is able to see &quot;every site on Russian territory where these North Korean soldiers are accumulating&#x2014;every camp,&quot; Zelensky said. With permission to launch Western long-range weapons at these targets, Ukraine could potentially prevent the deployment of North Korean troops on the front lines. &quot;Instead of providing the crucial long-range capabilities, however, America is watching, Britain is watching, and Germany is watching.&quot; Zelensky also called on China to exert its influence over Russia and North Korea, urging Beijing to prove its commitment to ending the war. While there have been growing reports that the U.K. may amend its position on Ukraine&apos;s of its Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, the U.S. and Germany continue to insist &#xA0;that such a move would lead to unnecessary escalation with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-merely-watching-as-north-korea-threat-grows-zelensky-warns/	2024-11-01T15:34:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Europe, Azerbaijan not close to deal on gas route via Ukraine, Slovakia's SPP says	European firms are not close to an agreement with Azerbaijan to replace Russian gas flows through Ukraine, Slovakian state-owned gas importer SPP told Reuters on Nov. 1, contradicting earlier media reports that said a deal was at hand. Ukraine currently transits Russian gas to the European Union as part of a deal signed in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. Europe and Ukraine have been in talks with Azerbaijan to replace Russia as a supplier. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 1 that energy companies from Hungary and Slovakia were nearing a contract for up to 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas from Azerbaijan per year, citing people familiar with the negotiations. Slovak energy supplier SPP dismissed these reports in a statement to Reuters. &quot;We regularly discuss the topic with our partners, but the information about the upcoming conclusion of a gas supply contract with the participation of SPP is not true,&quot; SPP&apos;s statement read. Slovakia is among the countries most reliant on Russian energy supplies. While Moscow cut much of its pipeline gas transit to Europe in 2022, Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary remain heavily dependent on Russian imports. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transport Azeri gas after Ukraine stops transiting Russian gas. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan would have to first transit through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. Europe is &quot;fully committed&quot; to phasing out Russian gas and is &quot;ready to live without this Russian gas coming from the Ukrainian transit route,&quot; EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-azerbaijan-not-close-to-deal-on-gas-route-via-ukraine-slovakias-spp-says/	2024-11-01T14:40:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1245921933.jpg
North Korean FM visits Moscow, promises to support Russia until 'victory' in Ukraine	North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui promised that North Korea would stand with Russia &quot;until the day of victory&quot; during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Nov. 1. Choe&apos;s visit comes as 8,000 North Korean troops are reportedly preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Our traditional, historically friendly relations, which have traveled the tested path of history, today ... are rising to a new level of relations of invincible military comradeship,&quot; Choe told Lavrov. Choe went on to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s &quot;wise leadership&quot; and said North Korea is convinced Russia will &quot;achieve a great victory in their sacred struggle to protect the sovereign rights and security interests of their state.&quot; &quot;And we also assure that until the day of victory we will firmly stand alongside our Russian comrades,&quot; she said. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either comes under attack. The Russian parliament ratified the defense treaty in October, amid reports that North Korea was sending troops along with weapons to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv has said that North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31 that at least 8,000 North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and are expected to participate in active combat in the coming days. &quot;North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat, but this is a matter of days, not months,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 31, urging Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount a more aggressive response to the Moscow-Pyongyang alliance. &quot;When deployed, they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.&quot; Choe and Lavrov did not mention the reports of troop deployment in their remarks. Zelensky has said that Russia has confirmed North Korea&apos;s direct involvement in the war to the West via military intelligence channels.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-fm-visits-moscow-promises-to-support-russia-until-victory-in-ukraine/	2024-11-01T13:55:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181551367.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces new aid package; Ukrainian drones target oil depot in Russia's Stavropol Krai	Key developments on Nov. 1: Washington announced on Nov. 1 a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $425 million, according to a U.S. Defense Department press release. A day prior, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference that the U.S. would &quot;soon&quot; provide Ukraine with another aid package in light of North Korean troops&apos; involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The recent military assistance is provided under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks. The aid list includes munitions for NASAMS missile systems, Stinger missiles, ammunition for HIMARS rocket systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition. Washington will also provide Kyiv with air-to-ground munitions, Stryker armored personnel carriers, counter-unmanned aerial systems (c-UAS) equipment and munitions, some medical equipment, and spare parts, among other contents of the package. The U.S. recently allocated another military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin had arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine nearly 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024. A Ukrainian drone fell on the territory of an oil depot in the town of Svetlograd in Russia&apos;s Stavropol Krai overnight on Nov. 1, Governor Vladimir Vladimirov claimed. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses overnight shot down 36 drones over Kursk Oblast, 20 over Bryansk Oblast, 12 over occupied Crimea, eight over Voronezh Oblast, four over Oryol Oblast, and three over Belgorod Oblast. The Russian Baza Telegram channel posted a video purporting to show a drone exploding at the oil depot in Svetlograd. The town of Svetlograd has around 35,000 residents and lies over 600 (372 miles) kilometers southeast of Ukraine&apos;s border in Donetsk Oblast. No casualties or damage have been reported. Emergency services were at the scene, Vladimirov said. Alexander Bogomaz, Bryansk Oblast governor, claimed that a drone hit an apartment building in the city of Bryansk overnight, injuring one person. Kyiv has not commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. A Ukrainian drone reportedly struck on Oct. 31 an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from Ukraine&apos;s border. Russia has seized more territory in its war with Ukraine over the past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 1, using Bloomberg Intelligence calculations based on the DeepState map service that tracks battlefield changes in coordination with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In recent months, Russian troops carried out a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers (442 square miles) in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year, the media outlet said. The Russian military also advanced by 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) over the past week, Bloomberg reported. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials are growing more despondent about the future course of the war, according to one official close to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office who spoke to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, according to Estonian intelligence, Moscow has seized 150 square kilometers (58 square miles) in the Donetsk sector of the front line over the past week. Russian troops have reportedly captured the town of Selydove, but Ukraine has not yet confirmed the reports. Bloomberg said Russia&apos;s next targets are the towns of Poskovsk and Kurakhove, important logistical hubs for the Ukrainian military. Observers and the Ukrainian military have previously warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove. Russia launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700. A total of 2,023 were recorded, according to the report. Of these, 1,185 were downed, 738 were &quot;lost,&quot; and 29 flew back out of Ukraine&apos;s airspace. No information was given about the remaining 71, but numerous strikes by Russian drones were reported during October, such as attacks that killed two people including a 15-year-old girl in Kyiv in recent days. According to the General Staff, Russia has launched a total of 6,987 strike drones since the start of the year, meaning 29% of them were launched during last month. The total number is significantly higher than September&apos;s previous record tally. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&quot; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot; North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, potentially exceeding those of Russia, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Nov. 1. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. North Korean soldiers are usually trained to fight in mountainous terrain, which means they are not familiar with Ukrainian territory, its climate, and geography, Kiviselg said. &quot;Their training does not include combat operations in such conditions, and the training they receive in the Russian Federation is certainly not of a very high level,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;Therefore, we can expect North Korean units to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, and probably even more than the Russian Federation&apos;s forces have suffered so far.&quot; He said that the North Korean troops arrived in Kursk Oblast in &quot;early October,&quot; having previously undergone two to four weeks of training. Following this, North Korean soldiers redeployed to the &quot;Ukrainian front,&quot; Kiviselg added. &quot;The arrival of North Korean soldiers on the Ukrainian front will likely take place in stages,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;If this additional deployment of (North Korean) units in Russia, their training, and then arrival on the Ukrainian front continues in the long term, it could certainly bring some changes to the front line.&quot; Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to U.S. intelligence. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-aid-package-ukrainian-drones-target-oil-depot-in-russias-stavropol-krai/	2024-11-01T13:17:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161682493.jpg
Lavrov criticizes Turkey for supplying military equipment to Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized Turkey&apos;s supply of military equipment to Ukraine to help it fight off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the Turkish outlet Hurriyet reported on Nov. 1. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has still aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Lavrov expressed his gratitude to the Turkish government &quot;for facilitating the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis,&quot; particularly mentioning the talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul in March 2022, which were eventually abandoned after Ukrainians retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. Yet the Russian foreign minister criticized Turkey for supporting Ukraine in the war by supplying military equipment. Lavrov said this &quot;cannot but cause surprise,&quot; given the Turkish leadership&apos;s statements about its readiness to mediate between Ukraine and Russia. Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty, and his administration has given significant aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ankara also has long been trying to take a leading role in peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Meanwhile, Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&apos;s sanctions. In 2023, Ankara became the world&apos;s biggest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, importing around 42.2 billion euros ($45.9 billion) in oil, natural gas, and coal from the country &#x2014; a fivefold increase over the past decade. The Financial Times (FT) on Oct. 22 reported that Turkey had quietly blocked the export of U.S.-origin military goods to Russia following a warning from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-criticizes-turkey-for-supplying-military-equipment-to-ukraine/	2024-11-01T12:35:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg
Ukrainian Americans weigh in on upcoming Trump vs Harris election	If Democratic candidate Kamala Harris&#x2019;s campaign promises to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia would make her the obvious choice for Ukrainian Americans in the 2024 presidential elections, voters in the diaspora are anything but united in their choice for president. Despite Republican candidate Donald Trump&#x2019;s open hostility to aid for Ukraine and apparent close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, some Ukrainian American voters feel he&#x2019;s the one who could end the war swiftly. &#x201C;If there is any president who would be able to get Putin to negotiate a deal that Putin would agree with because he can go back to his people and say he&#x2019;s a winner but leave most of Ukraine intact, I think it&#x2019;s Trump,&#x201D; Ukrainian American Dennis Goldenberg told the Kyiv Independent. As voters head to the polls on Nov. 5 in a presidential election that is predicted to be decided on razor-thin margins, many voting Ukrainian Americans will be doing so with the war in mind, but with competing visions of which president could better serve Ukraine. Ukrainians in the U.S. who can&#x2019;t vote are watching the election with the hopes that their would-be pick for president will be the one to bring peace to the nation at war. In the run-up to the election, the Kyiv Independent asked Ukrainians in the U.S. who can and can&#x2019;t vote about the outcome they&#x2019;d most like to see. In Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state with 19 Electoral College votes that likely provides a path to victory for either presidential candidate, the Philadelphia area is home to one of America&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian communities. Eugene Luciw, president of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America&#x2019;s Philadelphia Branch says that as a resident of the area, he knows Ukrainian Americans across the political spectrum. He says it&#x2019;s not surprising that many Ukrainians will vote for Trump, but emotionally, it&#x2019;s a bit surprising. As a registered Republican, he&#x2019;s familiar with the argument Ukrainian Americans make for Trump. Eugene Luciw, a registered Republican and leader in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Ukrainian community in New York City, U.S., on Oct. 24, 2024. Voting for Kamala Harris is an easy decision for Eugene Luciw. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The case &#x2013; with which he doesn&#x2019;t agree &#x2014; they make goes as follows: Russia illegally annexed Crimea while the U.S. was under a Democratic administration, then under Trump&#x2019;s four years, Russia didn&#x2019;t invade Ukraine only to launch a full-scale invasion once a Democrat was back in the White House. &#x201C;They see a pattern of weakness (with Democrats), a pattern of strength (with Republicans), and I think that translates into a hope and belief that Trump, if elected president, will provide that strong man motif.&#x201D; They believe Trump will respond strongly and back down the adversary despite what he says on the trail,&quot; he says. &#x201C;I believe Trump (when) he says he is going to try and resolve the (war) in one day, and the fact that he will resolve it in one day, the only way you&#x2019;re going to do that is to force Ukraine to give up its current territory,&#x201D; Luciw says. &#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s abundantly stupid for Ukraine. I am going to cast my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.&#x201D; Goldberg has never doubted his decision to vote for Trump on Nov. 5. For the Ukrainian American from Philadelphia, the best election outcome for Ukraine is a powerful U.S. leader, which he says he sees more in Trump than in Harris. &#x201C;I think his view on this war matches mine, which is that, ultimately, I fear that if the war continues, it&#x2019;s going to get bogged down in a stalemate. I think (Trump) understands a little bit better how Putin operates,&#x201D; Goldberg says. &#x201C;If there is any president who would be able to get Putin to negotiate a deal that Putin would agree with because he can go back to his people and say he&#x2019;s a winner but leave most of Ukraine intact, I think it&#x2019;s Trump.&#x201D; It isn&#x2019;t just the war in Ukraine that Goldberg is voting on. He supports Trump&#x2019;s proposed tax cuts and thinks he put the Middle East closer to peace than any president. He also supports the building of a wall on the U.S. southern border with Mexico to stymie illegal immigration. Half of Goldberg&#x2019;s family is from Moldova, and the other half is from Kamianets-Podilskyi, in the west of Ukraine. Goldberg says he believes in Trump&#x2019;s alleged ability to end the war within 24 hours of taking office. &#x201C;I kind of do get that he doesn&#x2019;t want to say how he is going to do it because then he loses leverage because once you tell your plan, your enemy knows your plan.&#x201D; Goldberg told the Kyiv Independent that he thinks Trump will be best for Ukraine because he&#x2019;s been the only president of the last four under which Russia hasn&#x2019;t taken more territory. Putin illegally annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine&apos;s east during the term of Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and invaded Georgia under the last Republican administration before Trump during President George W. Bush&#x2019;s term. Days out from the election, Tatus shares the mindset of America&#x2019;s undecided that both campaigns have spent millions of dollars and traveled thousands of miles across the country trying to reach. The 22-year-old Manhattan banker and Ukrainian citizen is not only undecided about who he hopes wins on Nov. 5, but he&#x2019;s also limited in his power to make an impact. He can&#x2019;t vote. After completing four years of undergraduate studies in the U.S., the Kyiv-born numbers cruncher isn&#x2019;t convinced his long-term future is in the U.S., so he hasn&#x2019;t bothered with citizenship. Anton Tatus in New York City, US, on Oct. 24, 2024. Tatus left Kyiv at the end of the Trump presidency and is unsure when he&#x2019;ll return to Ukraine. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)He left Kyiv at 16 years old with a dream to work on Wall Street. Now that most nights are spent wide-eyed in Microsoft Excel for work, he&#x2019;s questioning when he could go back to Ukraine, if he can. The stakes are high for this Ukrainian citizen. During the next U.S. presidential administration, he will turn 25, the conscription age for the Ukrainian military, which means if he does return to Ukraine, he would be eligible for the draft. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who I want to win. It&#x2019;s a very complicated question (for) a Ukrainian citizen &#x2026; someone who cares for Ukraine, I&#x2019;d probably have a controversial answer,&#x201D; Tatus says. &#x201C;I think Trump might be potentially better for Ukraine than Kamala, which I know doesn&#x2019;t align with the consensus view on this topic.&#x201D; Despite believing that neither Harris nor Trump could end the war immediately, Tatus reserves a touch of hope for Ukraine in Trump&apos;s uncertainty. &#x201C;Trump is a wild card. I don&#x2019;t think he himself knows what he&#x2019;s going to do. I think it&#x2019;s going to be fully dependent on who he appoints as secretary of state and defense.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#x201C;Kamala, in terms of her foreign policy on Ukraine, it will be just an extension of the Biden Administration. We&#x2019;ll get some aid but barely enough to survive.&#x201D; Despite the widespread expectation that Harris will continue Biden&#x2019;s approach to Ukraine, some view her broader candidacy as too progressive. If it were 2020, Tatus says he&#x2019;d hands down be a Biden supporter. Like other Ukrainians who can&#x2019;t vote, his perception of the nominee&#x2019;s platforms would be less single-issue focused on foreign policy if he was a citizen. &#x201C;If I was an American citizen, I wouldn&#x2019;t be so confident in Trump, it becomes very complicated, it becomes fifty-fifty.&#x201D; Demkiw has spent the last few months selling Ukraine to American investors. The Ukrainian Canadian from Kyiv has worked in Kyiv and New York for a venture capital startup investing in Ukrainian technology. She wishes she had the citizenship to vote and the time to canvas for Harris. Knowing some Americans won&#x2019;t vote at all is as infuriating as knowing those who will vote for Trump, Demkiw says. Once Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in early 2022, Demkiw&#x2019;s once-moral opposition to Trump grew to include foreign policy concerns as she began to see through her venture capital work how American Democrats as a party tended to back Ukraine more than Republicans.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;In terms of Trump versus (Harris) on Ukraine, I think neither one guarantees anything but Trump&#x2019;s action is worse than (Harris&#x2019;s) potential inaction,&#x201D; Demkiw says. &#x201C;While (Harris) might not be able to convince Congress to pass aid, at least she&#x2019;ll be open to the idea of Ukrainian victory. Trump had two opportunities to express (interest in Ukrainian victory) during the presidential debate and did not.&#x201D; Although she doesn&#x2019;t subscribe to the Trump-supporting view of some Ukrainians, Demkiw understands the thinking of many who arrived in America after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The equation of the Democratic party to communism, the appeal of capitalism, the promise of the American dream, and upward mobility that Trump sells to his base are elements Demkiw says she speaks to some Ukrainians planning to vote for Trump vote on Nov. 5. &#x201C;Trump will ride on the victory of wiping America&#x2019;s hands of the Ukraine war; that&#x2019;s enough for him, so it&#x2019;ll be a rapid ceasefire and no extension into NATO.&#x201D; &#x201C;The future of my country lies in this election.&#x201D; Lytvynova is nearly 5,000 miles away from the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, where her partner is serving in the Ukrainian military. Because of this, the New York resident is much more in touch with how decisions in the White House impact Ukraine&#x2019;s front line. When Russia first invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region in 2014, Lytvynova fled the steel-producing city of Alchevsk, where she was born. Ten years on, she works for a U.S. media monitoring startup focused on Ukraine that looks at narratives around her home country. Prior to her relocation to New York in the fall of 2024, Lytvynova says the image of the Democratic party abroad that she was told to expect is one of liberal &#x2018;wokeism&#x2019; and anti-family values, none of which have proven to be accurate she says. She&#x2019;s concerned that some in the right-leaning international media present the Democratic party as somewhat &#x201C;anti-everything Ukraine stands for right now,&#x201D; which she says is not true. &#xA0; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure who I would vote for. I don&#x2019;t think I would vote for Trump, but I&#x2019;m not sure I would vote for (Harris) either,&#x201D; says Lytvynova, who does not have citizenship and thus can&#x2019;t vote. Alyssa Lytvynova in New York City, US, on Oct. 24, 2024. With her partner serving on the frontlines in Ukraine, Lytvynova will feel the impact at home if the next presidency backs down from supporting the Ukrainian military. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;But I still think she could do better in explaining what she really means behind those ambiguous &#x2018;let&#x2019;s not turn back&#x2019; phrases,&#x201D; Lytvynova says, referencing Harris&#x2019;s campaign phrases similar to &#x201C;when we fight, we win,&#x201D; that often serve as reference to Trump-era turmoil or as crowd pleasers. Lytvynova says a vote for Harris is the choice between two evils. Too many people are putting trust in Trump&#x2019;s word that he&#x2019;ll end the war in Ukraine in a day, she says. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that is the case.&#x201D; And if reporting from acclaimed Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward is true that Trump has been speaking with Putin repeatedly, Lytvynova asks why hasn&#x2019;t he done anything about the war he claims he&#x2019;ll have immediate authority over. &#x201C;Both parties will continue the same approach. They will give some money, and they will fund us a little bit, but they will not give us enough to have a turning point in the war.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s unpredictability is terrifying, Ordynat says, but so too is the fear of isolation that a Harris White House could bring to Ukraine. The 23-year-old public health professional, from Rivne in Ukraine&#x2019;s west is worried Harris will continue President Biden&#x2019;s policies toward Ukraine of delaying and limiting aid based on fears of escalation. Ordynat feels defeated by her inability to vote and frustrated by the reality that not every eligible voter exercises their right to do so. If she could, she&#x2019;d vote for Harris. The vice president is reasonable and predictable, she says. &#x201C;The elections are making me feel uneasy for the future of Ukraine. I believe both presidential candidates have made a lot of promises to Ukraine but haven&#x2019;t necessarily upheld them in the past,&#x201D; Ordynat says. Dariia Ordynat, an active member in the Ukrainian community in New York City, US, on Oct. 24, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;I would still vote for Harris. However, I&#x2019;m still a little scared of her candidacy as well because sometimes her approach lacks strength with the situation in Ukraine. We&#x2019;re just prolonging something inevitable.&#x201D; Ordynat says that while Harris has made it obvious she stands with Ukraine, she fears she will continue to give Ukraine only some aid but without taking an aggressive enough approach to end the war. Despite a distaste for Trump, she&#x2019;s not surprised that some Ukrainians in the U.S. support Trump. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re conservative in their nature. They tend to overlook how awful Trump might be for (Ukraine).&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-americans-weigh-in-on-upcoming-trump-vs-harris-election/	2024-11-01T12:28:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2028790545.jpg
US announces new military aid package worth $425 million	Washington announced on Nov. 1 a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $425 million, according to a U.S. Defense Department press release. The day prior, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference that the U.S. would &quot;soon&quot; provide Ukraine with another aid package in light of North Korean troops&apos; involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The recent military assistance is provided under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks. The aid list includes munitions for NASAMS missile systems, Stinger missiles, ammunition for HIMARS rocket systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition. Washington will also provide Kyiv with air-to-ground munitions, Stryker armored personnel carriers, counter-unmanned aerial systems (c-UAS) equipment and munitions, some medical equipment, and spare parts, among other contents of the package. The U.S. recently allocated another military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin had arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine nearly 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-new-military-aid-package-worth-425-million/	2024-11-01T11:45:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1996073809-1.jpeg

Russian missile strike on Kharkiv kills 1, injures 30	Russia carried out an attack on Kharkiv on Nov. 1, killing a police officer and injuring at least 30 other people, local authorities reported. Two missiles hit a police station, killing police officer Andrii Matvienko. Twenty-six police officers and four civilians were injured in the attack, Kharkiv regional police reported. Russia used either Iskander-M or S-300/S-400 missiles to strike the city, according to preliminary data. The two explosions sounded at close to 4 p.m. local time. The strikes damaged 14 residential buildings, as well as heating and water supply networks, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Emergency services are continuing to clear the rubble, under which there may be more victims, according to local authorities. The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial strikes, often targeting densely populated neighborhoods. A Russian attack on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark that has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. Russia on Oct. 30 attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening, killing a man and two boys aged 12 and 15, and injuring 36 others.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-strike-on-kharkiv-kills-1-injures-30/	2024-11-01T11:29:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01-19_42_26.jpeg
Russia seizes more territory over past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reports	Russia has seized more territory in its war with Ukraine over the past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 1, using Bloomberg Intelligence calculations based on the DeepState map service that tracks battlefield changes in coordination with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In recent months, Russian troops carried out a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers (442 square miles) in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year, the media outlet said. The Russian military also advanced by 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) over the past week, Bloomberg reported. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials are growing more despondent about the future course of the war, according to one official close to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office who spoke to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, according to Estonian intelligence, Moscow has seized 150 square kilometers (58 square miles) in the Donetsk sector of the front line over the past week. Russian troops have reportedly captured the town of Selydove, but Ukraine has not yet confirmed the reports. Bloomberg said Russia&apos;s next targets are the towns of Poskovsk and Kurakhove, important logistical hubs for the Ukrainian military. Observers and the Ukrainian military have previously warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seizes-more-territory-over-past-week-than-at-any-time-in-2024-during-same-period-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-01T10:16:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168107584.jpg
North Korean troops could suffer even greater losses in Ukraine than Russia, Estonian intelligence says	North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, potentially exceeding those of Russia, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Nov. 1. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. North Korean soldiers are usually trained to fight in mountainous terrain, which means they are not familiar with Ukrainian territory, its climate, and geography, Kiviselg said. &quot;Their training does not include combat operations in such conditions, and the training they receive in the Russian Federation is certainly not of a very high level,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;Therefore, we can expect North Korean units to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, and probably even more than the Russian Federation&apos;s forces have suffered so far.&quot; He said that the North Korean troops arrived in Kursk Oblast in &quot;early October,&quot; having previously undergone two to four weeks of training. Following this, North Korean soldiers redeployed to the &quot;Ukrainian front,&quot; Kiviselg added. &quot;The arrival of North Korean soldiers on the Ukrainian front will likely take place in stages,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;If this additional deployment of (North Korean) units in Russia, their training, and then arrival on the Ukrainian front continues in the long term, it could certainly bring some changes to the front line.&quot; Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to U.S. intelligence. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-could-suffer-even-greater-losses-in-ukraine-than-russia-estonian-intelligence-suggests/	2024-11-01T09:14:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Ukrainian Defense Ministry's chief inspector fired	Admiral Ihor Voronchenko has been dismissed from the post of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry&apos;s chief inspector, online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 1, citing the ministry. The Main Inspectorate of the Defense Ministry audits the ministry&apos;s activities, including monitoring the quality of military training and staffing, overseeing military aviation safety, and conducting technical investigations, among other functions. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed the order to dismiss Voronchenko on Oct. 31. The ministry did not provide any reasons for Voronchenko&apos;s dismissal. It is not yet known who will replace Voronchenko. In September, controversial lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla said that Umerov had allegedly fired Voronchenko after his report on military training centers at a meeting of the headquarters of the supreme commander-in-chief. The admiral&apos;s report was very critical and allegedly &quot;angered&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Bezuhla said. Yet this information has not been confirmed by any official. In 2003, Voronchenko began serving in the Ukrainian Navy. He was in Crimea when Russia invaded and illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014. At that time, he served as a deputy commander of the Navy. Voronchenko was the chief commander of the Navy from 2016 to 2020, after which he was appointed inspector of the Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/admiral-voronchenko-dismissed-as-chief-inspector-of-defense-ministry/	2024-11-01T08:28:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2154777749.jpg
Russia not advancing in Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, contact line stabilized, Ukraine says	Russian troops are not advancing in the embattled towns of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, and the contact line has been stabilized, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk Anastasia Bobovnikova, said on Nov. 1. Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova refuted Russian claims that the two towns had been captured by Moscow&apos;s forces. Toretsk and Chasiv Yar have become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;At the moment, they do not have an advantage in these towns. The contact line is stabilized,&quot; Bobovnikova said. According to the spokesperson, Russian troops have not crossed the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in Chasiv Yar, but are moving there in small groups trying to gain a foothold. &quot;The purpose of such actions is to accumulate as much as possible before the attack. However, such attempts are detected by our drones and are targeted,&quot; she added. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the Siverskyi Donets &#x2013; Donbas Canal as the new front line. Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of Toretsk as of mid-October, while Russia had captured the remainder. The loss of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south early last month. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-no-advantage-in-chasiv-yar-toretsk-contact-line-stabilized-kyiv-says/	2024-11-01T07:05:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2167352745.jpg
Opinion: Accessibility in Ukraine remains elusive as Russia’s war reveals systemic failures	As of June, more than 50,000 Ukrainians have lost one or more limbs in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, and more than 3 million people&#x2014;10% of the population&#x2014;live with a disability. In theory, Ukraine has a legislative framework to protect people with disabilities and ensure their inclusion in society. In practice, however, outdated infrastructure and prevailing social attitudes still uphold significant barriers three years into the full-scale invasion. Modern residential complexes, sleek shopping centers, and trendy restaurants are common in Kyiv, but Soviet-era public infrastructure is still pervasive. Ubiquitous underground crosswalks with long staircases, apartment buildings, government offices, stores, cultural centers, and even the subway remain largely inaccessible. In the Soviet Union, people with disabilities were often viewed as expendable burdens&#x2014;if they were acknowledged at all. After World War II and well into the transition years of the 1990s, people with disabilities were largely confined to their homes: transit was inaccessible, elevators often broke down, and wheelchairs and prosthetics were impractical and scarce. Despite the millions of amputee veterans who returned from World War II, the state saw no reason to invest in accommodations to help them reintegrate into society. Instead, veterans with visible limb loss were considered &#x201C;uncomfortable&#x201D; reminders of the war, incompatible with the Soviet vision of postwar industrialization. The state even went so far as to ban people with disabilities from higher education through a secret decree. &#x201C;There are no invalids in the USSR!&#x201D; was the official response at the 1980 Moscow Olympics when Western journalists asked whether Paralympians would compete. Through forced erasure, an entire population was made invisible. Although conditions have greatly improved since Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, significant challenges persist. Simply moving around Ukrainian cities remains challenging as even basic accessibility features&#x2014;like ramps&#x2014;are not common. The few that do exist are often too steep, too narrow, or blocked by generators or merchandise displays, rendering them useless. Oleksandr Budko (callsign &#x201C;Teren&#x201D;), a veteran of the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion who has experienced double limb loss, is a public figure, activist, and Season 13 Bachelor contestant. Both Budko and &#xA0;Yevhen Syvoplias, a veteran and activist, have been using their respective social platforms to highlight the barriers facing wheelchair users across Ukraine. Their videos capture everything from curbed sidewalks to unreachable call buttons for assisted entry, broken wheelchair lifts, and the indifference of many passersby. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; &#x425;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x1F48D;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44F;&#x43A; &amp; &#x425;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44F;&#x447;&#x43A;&#x430; (@holostyakstb) Ramps alone, however, are only a small part of the picture, says Oleksandr Bazylevych, a former drone operator with the 3rd Regiment of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces, who lost three limbs during an offensive outside Kupiansk in September 2023. In reality, many businesses with visible ramps fail to meet other essential needs&#x2014;such as wide enough entrances or accessible restrooms for wheelchair users. Dialogue and cooperation from business owners are critical to implementing structural changes that foster a more inclusive society. This would benefit not only wheelchair users but also parents with strollers, seniors, and others with limited mobility. Public transportation also needs an upgrade (and a dedicated city budget) as the subway and private mini buses, or &#x201C;marshrutky,&#x201D; are impossible for wheelchair users to navigate, leaving private taxis as the main&#x2014;and unaffordable&#x2014;option. Physical barriers aren&#x2019;t the only challenges for veterans with disabilities. A long-standing Soviet belief that people with disabilities cannot live independently continues to permeate society. Bazylevych says he is constantly asked by everyone from taxi drivers to train staff where his attendant is&#x2014;a frustrating assumption rooted in outdated notions of perceived helplessness. Although people often offer to help him navigate difficult situations, Bazylevych emphasizes that universal accessibility must be a priority: &#x201C;Accessibility is important, because objectively-speaking, there are many people who require it. I don&#x2019;t need any special entitlements, I just want to work and live my life. Society as a whole needs to change its perception of people with disabilities because we can work, we can earn money, we just need conditions that allow this to happen. These (structural) changes only need to be instituted once, it&#x2019;s not a years-long process&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t need much, just the possibility to get around freely and have access to the basics.&#x201D; Against the backdrop of war, projects promoting visibility, destigmatization, and inclusion are creating a blueprint for true accessibility in Ukraine. One such project is Kurazh, a popular cultural and social event in Kyiv that combines lectures and performances with curated local brands. Known for its focus on tolerance and inclusivity, Kurazh has raised over 50 million hryvnias with the help of 750,000 guests over the past decade.

(Yuriy Dyachyshyn / AFP via Getty Images)Recently, the festival has included a booth for the Superhumans rehabilitation and prosthetics center, sign language interpreters, accessible parking, photo exhibits of people with facial differences, wheelchair-friendly children&#x2019;s playgrounds, and more. Kurazh&#x2019;s founders say their commitment to accessibility began in 2016 when they defined accessibility as synonymous with freedom, their most valued principle. Each small step brings Ukraine closer to a barrier-free society and a new socio-cultural definition of &#x201C;normal.&#x201D; Fight For Right, an organization taking a service-based approach, organizes evacuations for people with disabilities (who face additional obstacles compared to able-bodied people), advocates for legislative changes, and offers a braille studio, inclusive cinema, and inclusivity workshops and consultations for businesses and communities. Superhumans Center, Ukraine&#x2019;s most recognizable full-service rehabilitation and prosthetics center due in part to its large social media presence, goes beyond typical post-injury services. The center&#x2019;s team works daily to destigmatize disability through initiatives like Q&amp;A sessions for school-aged children, introducing them to diversity at a young age and teaching that difference is normal rather than something to fear. As a new generation grows up in a war-marked reality, there&#x2019;s hope that indifference and objectification will give way to genuine efforts to prioritize accessibility in a rapidly evolving society. When asked about his future, Bazylevych reflects on his life as someone who has lost three limbs and what he would say to those who question whether it was worth it: &#x201C;My future? I want to leave the military, continue to work and travel, meet new people, and widen my horizons. I would tell them that everything&#x2019;s okay in my life. I&#x2019;m a worthy citizen of my country; I did everything that I felt I needed to do. I have a job, I travel, I have friends, I have many positive and interesting things in my life&#x2014;everything&#x2019;s not so bad after all.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/opinion-accessibility-in-ukraine-remains-elusive-as-war-reveals-systemic-failures/	2024-11-01T06:50:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1258882273.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Minsk rushes with presidential election, seeking to hand Lukashenko a victory ahead of term's end	Belarus rushes forward with a presidential election, seeking to hand Alexander Lukashenko a victory six months ahead of the official term&apos;s end. In an interview, Lukashenko says North Korean troops fighting against Ukraine would be an &#x201C;escalation.&#x201D; Belarus and Russia to hold major joint military drills in September 2025. Belarus court sentences two Ukrainians to 20 years in prison for alleged terrorism. As Lukashenko claims willingness to consider pardon for opposition leader Maria Kalesnikava, human rights activists say her prison is known for widespread torture. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) on Oct. 29 registered an initiative group supporting the candidacy of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for the presidency, while rejecting applications to register groups for two other candidates. The move effectively allows Lukashenko to run for a seventh consecutive term in office unopposed. The election is to be held on Jan. 26, 2025. At the first CEC meeting, only Lukashenko&apos;s group received the registration necessary to start campaigning. Now, several more candidates were registered, all allies of Lukashenko and his regime. Aleh Haidukevich, leader of the pro-Lukashenko Liberal Democratic Party, said he is an active supporter of Lukashenko since 1994. Alexander Hizhnyak, leader of the pro-Lukashenko Republican Party, said &quot;Lukashenko is right choice for president.&quot; Another &quot;candidate&quot; is Olga Chemodanova, a former spokeswoman of the interior ministry, supported the suppression of protests and persecution of the opposition, saying that she supports the president in full. Belarus hasn&#x2019;t had free or fair elections since 1994, when Lukashenko came to power. The previous presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoked nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. In the course of quelling the opposition, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime eliminated independent media, closed over 1,700 non-profit civic organizations, banned all but four political parties loyal to the regime, and jailed over 1,300 political prisoners. In late October, the Belarusian parliament approved Jan. 26 as the date for the seventh Belarusian presidential elections, nearly half a year earlier than stipulated in the country&#x2019;s election legislation, and a month earlier than the previously rumored date of Feb. 23. The Belarusian Central Election Commission, led by Ihar Karpenka, justified bringing the election forward as necessary for kicking off the new &#x201C;five-year socio-economic development cycle&#x201D; with a &#x201C;re-elected&#x201D; leader. Some experts, however, attribute the rush to hold the election to Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to secure his domestic political position ahead of potential negotiations over Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. RFE/RL political analyst Valer Karbalevich suggested Lukashenko may be eyeing a role in future peace negotiations, while analyst Alexander Friedman noted that the accelerated election could also be a preparation for a potential escalation of the conflict. Meanwhile, political analyst Artsiom Shraibman argues that the early election process is attributable to Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to mitigate risks of unrest by holding it in the cold winter month of January. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya denounced the election as a &#x201C;sham,&#x201D; accusing Lukashenko&#x2019;s administration of running a &#x201C;fake electoral process&#x201D; under an &#x201C;atmosphere of terror.&#x201D; In a joint statement with her shadow cabinet and the opposition&#x2019;s Coordination Council, Tsikhanouskaya urged her supporters to vote &#x201C;against all&#x201D; on the ballot in protest. Belarusian political analysts believe that while the proposed tactics won&#x2019;t stop Lukashenko from being reelected, they are the only possible and safe way for voters to register opposition to the authorities. Even though the opposition is campaigning for Belarusians to vote against all candidates, a member of Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s shadow cabinet, Yury Hubarevich, attempted to register as a presidential candidate. &#x201C;We must confirm with practical steps that no one but people approved by the regime will be able to participate in these elections,&#x201D; Hubarevich told Zerkalo.io, explaining why he was attempting to register. The current election legislation is stacked against the exiled Belarusian opposition: Only people who have been resident in Belarus for the past 20 years can register as presidential candidates, and they can hold no foreign residencies or citizenships. Most of the opposition activists also have convictions in politically motivated criminal cases, ruling them out as possible candidates for president. Russia has already backed Lukashenko&apos;s candidacy. &#x201C;We will definitely be following the developments of the election campaign very closely,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russia&apos;s state-run TASS. Earlier, Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to Belarus, Boris Gryzlov, said Moscow will assist Minsk if there are &#x201C;attempts to destabilize the situation&#x201D; during the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus. As the election campaign nears, Belarusian police have tightened their control of former political prisoners and those sentenced to house arrest, the independent Belarusian media outlet Euroradio wrote. Lukashenko opponents are summoned to police stations and forced to sign a &#x201C;formal warning,&#x201D; prohibiting them from carrying out actions aimed at &#x201C;changing the constitutional order by force.&#x201D; In an interview with the BBC on Oct. 23, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko dismissed reports that North Korean troops have been deployed in Ukraine, saying that such a move would be &#x201C;a step towards escalation.&#x201D; &#x201C;Knowing his character, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia&#x2019;s special operation in Ukraine,&#x201D; Lukashenko said, when the information about the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia was already confirmed by Kyiv and Soul. Hours later, the deployment was confirmed by Washington D.C. Lukashenko argued that the involvement of the armed forces of any other country would be a step towards escalation and prompt NATO to deploy its troops in Ukraine. &#x201C;Even if we (Belarus) got involved in the war, this would be a path to escalation. Why? Because you, the &#x2018;Anglo-Saxons,&#x2019; would immediately say that another country had become involved on one side... so NATO troops would be deployed to Ukraine,&#x201D; Lukashenko said. Russian propagandists commonly refer to the English-speaking countries, primarily the United States and the United Kingdom, as &#x201C;Anglo-Saxons.&#x201D; While being Russia&#x2019;s steadfast ally, Belarus has not sent its troops to the front line. However, the Russian military used Belarusian territory and infrastructure to stage its failed assault on Kyiv in the early days of the all-out invasion. In the interview, Lukashenko denied providing Belarus&#x2019;s territory for the attack. According to him, Putin had been withdrawing the troops from the Belarus-Ukraine border but &#x201C;was provoked&#x201D; to &#x201C;turn them&#x201D; on Kyiv. In reality, there was a months-long buildup of Russian troops in Belarus and in parts of Russia close to the Ukrainian border. Russian troops also attacked Ukraine from the south, and from the Russian-occupied Crimea. Lukashenko also denied being requested to commit his troops to the battlefield. &#x201C;Never. Neither he (Putin), nor (former Defense Minister) Sergei Shoigu, nor the current Defense Minister Andrei Belousov has ever raised that question.&#x201D; Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, earlier said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, Zelensky said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while the Kremlin&#x2019;s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer. Belarus and Russia will hold joint strategic military exercises in Belarus in September 2025, Belarusian Air Force and Air Defense Forces Commander Andrey Lukyanovich told Belarusian state-owned TV channel STV on Oct. 28. According to Lukyanovich, Russia and Belarus will conduct preparative &#x201C;operative-tactical exercises with live firing&#x201D; in 2025, leading to a &#x201C;joint strategic exercise&#x201D; in September 2025. The Air Force Commander did not name the exercise, yet the announcement comes on the heels of a meeting of the joint board of the Defense Ministries of the two states on Oct. 23, which approved the concept of the &#x201C;Zapad-2025&#x201D; joint strategic exercise of the armed forces without specifying the dates. The previous Zapad strategic exercise took place in 2021, involving 200,000 Russian and Belarusian troops, with approximately 12,800 hosted in Belarus. It was followed by another military drill, the &#x201C;Union Resolve 2022,&#x201D; which was actually a disguise for the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border in late 2021 ahead of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A Belarusian court has sentenced Serhiy and Pavlo Kabarchuk, a father and son from Ukraine, each to 20 years in prison for allegedly organizing a terrorist act in Belarus, the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta reported on Oct. 23. The two were detained on Feb. 15, 2024, after allegedly trying to smuggle weapons and explosives across the border of Belarus, helped by Ukraine&#x2019;s SBU security agency and State Border Guard Service. The next day, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko announced a successful &#x201C;counterterrorist operation,&#x201D; and a state TV channel aired footage of the Kabarchuks &#x201C;confessing,&#x201D; likely under duress, of working on the orders of the SBU. Ukrainian State Border Guard Service Colonel Andriy Demchenko dismissed the claims, saying, &#x201C;there is no end to Lukashenko&#x2019;s absurdity.&#x201D; The Kabarchuks&#x2019; trial started on Sept. 26 in the southern Belarusian city of Homiel. The charges against them included attempting to commit a terrorist act, the illegal handling of firearms and explosives, smuggling firearms across the border, and undercover activities. The Belarusian authorities said both the father and son cooperated with investigators. At least 12 Ukrainian citizens are held behind bars in Belarus on trumped-up charges, according to the Viasna Human Rights Group. The pressure on the Ukrainian community in Belarus has intensified since the all-out Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, in which Belarus sided with Russia and provided its territory for attacks on Ukrainian targets.

(Photo by Petras Malukas/AFP via Getty Images)Penal Colony No. 4 in the southern Belarusian city of Homiel, which houses prominent Belarusian political activist Maria Kalesnikava, uses torture against political prisoners, including placement in an outdoor cage on the territory of the colony, the International Committee for the Investigation of Torture. The report, presented on Oct. 22, includes testimonies from 20 political prisoners convicted after a crackdown on dissent in Belarus that followed protests against sham presidential elections held in 2020. All interviewed prisoners served their terms in Homiel&#x2019;s penal colony No. 4 between May 2021 to February 2024. &#x201C;One of the most heinous (punishments) is the cage located on the colony&#x2019;s territory at the checkpoint between the residential and industrial zones,&#x201D; the report reads. Women are reportedly placed in it for up to eight hours for refusing to comply with the demands of staff or for violent conflicts with other prisoners. Among the multitude of repressive tools in the colony, human rights activists highlight the blockade of communication with the outside world, being deprived of hygiene products and medical care, arbitrary punishments, the use of solitary confinement, and humiliating practices such as strip searches. Political prisoners face retaliation for their political views, according to Sergey Ustinov, the co-founder of the International Committee for the Investigation of Torture in Belarus. The committee is part of the International Accountability Platform of Belarus, a coalition of Belarusian and international human rights organizations documenting human rights violations by the Lukashenko regime. High-profile political prisoners like Kalesnikava are frequently subjected to solitary confinement, isolated from others, with fellow inmates forbidden from speaking to them. Kalesnikava, who led the campaign of presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was in turn sentenced to 11 years in prison, has been held incommunicado for over 600 days since being admitted to intensive care with a severe medical condition that developed while she was in detention. In remarks to the BBC on Oct. 23, Lukashenko declared he was ready to consider Kalesnikava&#x2019;s plea for a pardon. He claimed her family hadn&#x2019;t been granted visits because &#x201C;they didn&#x2019;t want to visit her.&#x201D; Members of Kalesnikava&#x2019;s family, who are actively seeking her release, say she is malnourished, weighing 45 kilograms (99 pounds) while being 175 cm (5&#x2019;7&#x201D;) tall. They said prison food is unsuitable for her condition, and they report having no contact with her. Since July 2024, Lukashenko has released 115 out of the country&#x2019;s 1,300 political prisoners in four rounds of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; while at the same time jailing more. Over July and August, human rights activists added 115 new names to Belarus&#x2019;s list of recognized political prisoners. On Sept. 16, that count rose again, with 22 new names added.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-minsk-rushes-with-presidential-election-seeks-to-hand-lukashenko-a-victory-ahead-of-terms-end/	2024-11-01T06:44:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179663468.jpg
Poland's Sikorski hits back at Zelensky's MiG-29 fighter jets criticism	Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has responded to criticism from Ukraine over the slow supply of fighter jets, insisting on Nov. 1 his country has done more for Kyiv &quot;than any other nation.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 31 said Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. &quot;We agreed with NATO that they would provide them (Poland) with a police mission, just like our Baltic friends, who do not have their own planes but have such a mission,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No. Was there another reason? Yes,&quot; he added without providing further details. In response, Sikorski told Polish journalists that taking into account &quot;military, financial, economic, humanitarian [assistance], and the assistance for Ukrainian refugees, Poland has done more for Ukraine in terms of GDP than any other nation.&quot; He added there are &quot;almost 300 of our tanks, a lot of heavy equipment, and planes across the eastern border.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re trying to help, but we&apos;re also a front-line country. Russia also threatens us, and not everything is possible,&quot; he added. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing grievances that are far from being resolved.	https://kyivindependent.com/polands-sikorski-hits-back-at-zelenskys-mig-29-fighter-jets-criticism/	2024-11-01T06:41:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2172451145.jpg
Russia's Lavrov reportedly to make first visit to EU country since launch of full-scale invasion of Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to visit Malta this December to attend the Organization for Security and Cooperation Ministerial Council (OSCE) meeting, the ministry&apos;s spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Vedomosti newspaper on Oct. 31. If the visit takes place, it will be Lavrov&apos;s first trip to an EU country since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The last time Lavrov visited an EU country was in 2021, when he traveled to the OSCE meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. He also visited &#xA0;the U.N. General Assembly in New York several times during Moscow&apos;s all-out war. While both the EU and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Lavrov in February 2022, they did not impose a travel ban as the EU and U.K. wanted to keep open diplomatic channels with Russia. According to the Maltese embassy in Russia, the decision to hold the meeting of OSCE&apos;s Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for Dec. 5-6 &quot;applies to all [its] members, including the Russian Federation,&quot; the Russian newspaper wrote. In 2023, Lavrov attended the OSCE summit in North Macedonia, which sparked a rift among the OSCE members, leading to a boycott of the meeting by foreign ministers of Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states. The OSCE was formed in the 1970s as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which provided a platform for dialogue between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc during the Cold War.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-reportedly-to-visit/	2024-11-01T06:12:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Opinion: Pennsylvania’s Ukrainian community has a huge stake in the US election	I am one of more than 120,000 Pennsylvanians of Ukrainian heritage who will vote on which presidential candidate best serves our interests. Since only 80,000 votes separated the presidential candidates in 2020, our community&apos;s vote could be key to deciding who wins Pennsylvania&apos;s 19 electoral votes in November: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. I have a personal stake in Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked war against Ukraine. Just days after the full-scale invasion began, I discovered I had five distant relatives in Ukraine, so I flew there to rescue them. What I saw in their eyes was the same blank, deer-in-the-headlights stare of Holocaust survivors when they were liberated. I realized at that moment I was there to do more than just get my relatives out. Since then, my wife, Ellen, and I have developed a network of &#x201C;angels&#x201D; who have helped thousands of refugees leave Ukraine, provide financial support, and settle in Pennsylvania, other states, and nations. After watching news of the full-scale invasion, Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a green light by calling his strategic decisions &#x201C;savvy&#x201D; and &#x201C;genius.&#x201D; When Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month, he promised to strike a &#x201C;rapid deal&#x201D; to end the war but provided no details. He reportedly said privately that he could end the war by pressuring Ukraine to surrender some territory. Trump has also claimed Ukraine was &#x201C;demolished&#x201D; and that &#x201C;the people are dead.&#x201D; In his debate with Vice President Harris, Trump twice refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. In response, members of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Polish community, veterans, social workers, small business owners, and several elected officials signed a letter last month endorsing Harris and vilifying Trump. &#x201C;Vice President Harris has a long, strong track record of protecting our democracy here at home and standing up for our brothers, sisters, parents, and grandparents in Poland&#x2014;the same people Vladimir Putin hopes to attack next if Ukraine were to fall,&#x201D; the letter read. &#x201C;Polish people in the U.S. and around the world know that our future is tied to Ukraine because if Putin is allowed to trample Ukraine, we know his next target could be Poland. Trump bowed to dictators like Putin before and he will do it again if he is reelected.&#x201D; Equally disturbing, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said, &#x201C;I gotta be honest, I don&#x2019;t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other.&#x201D; In contrast, when Harris met with Zelensky last month, she pledged to continue robust U.S. support if she is elected president. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Biden-Harris administration has allocated nearly $175 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine. Additionally, the administration created the &#x201C;Uniting for Ukraine&#x201D; refugee program, allowing Ukrainians to come to the U.S. and work legally immediately upon arrival, but only if an American sponsor is willing to support them financially. Since its launch, more than 236,000 cases have been approved, with 187,000 Ukrainian refugees already in the U.S. The resettlement of Ukrainian refugees has been relatively smooth, but their legal stay under humanitarian parole expires every two years. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees have settled efficiently in American communities with minimal controversy, including about 4,500 in Pennsylvania. Those who come to the U.S. under Uniting for Ukraine require an American sponsor willing to assist them financially, and they can work legally immediately upon setting foot on U.S. soil. For decades, America led the world in refugee admissions in a program that enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But Trump dramatically cut the refugee program. By the time he left office in January 2021, fewer than 12,000 refugees from all other countries combined were admitted to the U.S. in his last year. Imagine the hardships tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the war would face without a safe haven in America if Trump is elected president again. Unlike Donald Trump, Kamala Harris recognizes that America and other democracies worldwide have a moral and geopolitical interest in preserving the safety of the Ukrainian people, not just ensuring their survival but enabling them to thrive. I urge my fellow Pennsylvanians and Ukrainian Americans to elect her president.

Poland starts fortifying border with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave as part of 'East Shield' initiative	Poland has started building defensive lines on the border with Russia as part of the &quot;East Shield&quot; initiative, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 1. Presented this May, the &quot;East Shield&quot; program aims to fortify Poland&apos;s borders with Belarus, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. It includes a mix of new physical barriers, modern surveillance systems, and infrastructure development. The program is part of NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank joint regional defense infrastructure plan that Poland is carrying out with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Warsaw allocated a total of 10 billion z&#x142;oty ($2.5 billion) to strengthen the borders with Russia and Belarus to deter aggression. &quot;This is the largest operation to strengthen Poland&#x2019;s eastern border, NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank, since 1945,&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in spring. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small piece of land measuring 15,100 square kilometers &#x2014; not much larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut &#x2014; sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. It has a short, western coastline on the Baltic Sea. Its capital is also called Kaliningrad. Though it may be small, strategically it gives Russia a second point of direct access to the Baltic Sea, the other being through its most eastern arm in the Finnish Gulf. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base in Kaliningrad Oblast. The map of the Baltic Sea region. (The Kyiv Independent)The Suwalki Gap is the closest point between Kaliningrad Oblast, and one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies, Belarus. It&apos;s a mere 40 kilometers wide and closely tracks the Poland-Lithuania border on the Polish side. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic States. In May, Tusk said that Poland had begun strengthening its entire eastern border with Belarus due to a growing &quot;hybrid war&quot; and illegal migration. &#xA0; Warsaw for several years accused Belarus of deliberately pushing migrants into Poland in order to pressure the EU over sanctions, a charge Minsk has denied. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns that the Baltic states, which are among Moscow&apos;s biggest critics and Kyiv&apos;s staunchest allies since day one of the all-out war, could become the next target for aggression. These fears are reinforced by Russian leader Vladimir Putin&apos;s repeated threats to NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-starts-fortifying-border-with-russia-under-shield-east-program/	2024-11-01T05:22:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-01-133159.png
Russian drone strikes on Ukraine soared to record monthly levels during October, military says	Russia launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700. A total of 2,023 were recorded, according to the report. Of these, 1,185 were downed, 738 were &quot;lost,&quot; and 29 flew back out of Ukraine&apos;s airspace. No information was given about the remaining 71, but numerous strikes by Russian drones were reported during October, such as attacks that killed two people including a 15-year-old girl in Kyiv in recent days. According to the General Staff, Russia has launched a total of 6,987 strike drones since the start of the year, meaning 29% of them were launched during last month. The total number is significantly higher than September&apos;s previous record tally. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&#x201D; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strikes-on-ukraine-soared-to-record-monthly-levels-again-during-october/	2024-11-01T04:36:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Odesa.jpg
Trump says those who describe him as a 'friend of Russia' are 'sick'	Donald Trump has said those who consider him &quot;a friend of Russia&quot; are &quot;sick,&quot; in an interview with controversial far-right commentator Tucker Carlson in Arizona on Oct.31. &quot;They love to say that I was a friend of Russia. I worked for Russia, I was a Russian spy &#x2014; these people are sick,&quot; he said. According to journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, Trump secretly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after he left office. Trump has repeatedly backed and praised Putin and rarely criticized him. He described Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine as &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy&quot; in 2022. Later, Trump blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden for Moscow&apos;s all-out war. In 2018, Trump accepted Putin&#x2019;s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election over an assessment from his own intelligence services. The interview with Carlson comes less than a week before the U.S. presidential election, when Trump will face the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. A recent article by the Financial Times (FT) claims that Trump aims to effectively freeze the war and reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in the foreseeable future, at least &quot;until Putin leaves the stage.&quot; In an interview with Carlson, Trump claimed actions he took related to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline showed he wasn&apos;t friendly with Russia. Under Trump, the U.S. government &#xA0;imposed sanctions against Russian companies and the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. &quot;I killed. Nobody would kill it but me. I stopped it,&quot; Trump claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-sick-those-who-described-him-as-friend-of-russia/	2024-11-01T03:38:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181420636.jpg
Russian butter prices soar, rise in supermarket dairy thefts reported	The price of butter in Russia has soared nearly 25% since the beginning of 2024, Russian media reported on Oct. 31, prompting a spate of thefts in supermarkets across the country. Reuters reported that the price of one brand had risen by 34% since the start of the year and currently cost 239.96 roubles ($2.47). According to Russian independent news outlet Meduza, butter in some supermarkets is now packaged in the same anti-theft casings usually used for delicacies such as caviar and premium alcohol products. The move has been prompted by a rise in &#xA0;butter thefts, including one incident where two men were arrested after allegedly trying to steal 25 packets from a supermarket in Moscow. Surging government spending on war and defense production has seen Russia&apos;s economy shift to a war footing. Inflation in Russia has remained high throughout 2024, with the annual figure slowing to 8.63% in August, down slightly from 9.05% in August. To combat these pressures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has kept interest rates high, now set at an unprecedented 19%. Increases in costs associated with wages, interest rates, fuel, and transport, have all contributed to the rising cost of butter. The situation is being closely followed in the Kremlin which has sought hard to ensure its war in Ukraine does not affect the day-to-day lives of its citizens at home. Speaking on Oct. 23, Dmitry Patrushev, a deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, said the government was monitoring butter prices. Russia is also having to increase imports, with Meduza reporting that Turkey is now supplying butter to the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-butter-prices-soar-rise-in-supermarket-dairy-thefts-reported/	2024-11-01T02:04:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-500553344.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 24 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Nov. 1. Ukrainian forces downed 31 out of 48 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Fourteen more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; and three others flew towards Belarus, it added. Drone debris damaged several civilian enterprises, apartment buildings, and houses in Poltava, Cherkasy, Kyiv, and Odesa oblasts. Russian forces also reportedly fired three Kh-59/69 cruise missiles against Ukraine, with one of them shot down by air defenses. A Russian missile attack injured two first responders in the city of Odesa, damaging a fire station and cars, Governor Oleh Kiper said. A Russian attack on the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast killed a 75-year-old man, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five more men and one woman were injured in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, and the settlements of Derhachi and Kucherivka. A 78-year-old woman suffered injuries after Russian attacks near Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 19 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed, and 13 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Two people were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the town of Kurakhove and the village of Dronivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-103/	2024-11-01T01:47:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01_09-38-56.jpg
Ukrainian drone targets oil depot in Stavropol Krai, Russian governor claims	A Ukrainian drone fell on the territory of an oil depot in the town of Svetlograd in Russia&apos;s Stavropol Krai overnight on Nov. 1, Governor Vladimir Vladimirov has claimed. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses overnight shot down 36 drones over Kursk Oblast, 20 over Bryansk Oblast, 12 over occupied Crimea, eight over Voronezh Oblast, four over Oryol Oblast, and three over Belgorod Oblast. The Russian Baza Telegram channel posted a video purporting to show a drone exploding at the oil depot in Svetlograd. The town of Svetlograd has around 35,000 residents and lies over 600 (372 miles) kilometers southeast of Ukraine&apos;s border in Donetsk Oblast. No casualties or damage have been reported. Emergency services were at the scene, Vladimirov said. Alexander Bogomaz, Bryansk Oblast governor, claimed that a drone hit an apartment building in the city of Bryansk overnight, injuring one person. Kyiv has not commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. A Ukrainian drone reportedly struck on Oct. 31 an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the country&apos;s border.	https://kyivindependent.com/svetlograd-drone-oil/	2024-11-01T00:30:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-01-091544-1.png
General Staff: Russia has lost 696,410 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 696,410 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 1. This number includes 1,460 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,162 tanks, 18,470 armored fighting vehicles, 28.038 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,039 artillery systems, 1,244 multiple launch rocket systems, 994 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,088 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-696-410-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-31T23:14:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Over 45 countries pledge support at Montreal conference for the return of Ukrainian captives and deportees	Following the Ministerial Conference on the Human Dimension of the Peace Formula in Montreal, over 45 countries signed a pledge on Oct. 31 in support of facilitating the return of all Ukrainian captives and deportees. The theme of releasing prisoners and deportees was based on the fourth point of the Ukrainian Formula for Peace, It took place in Montreal, Canada, and was attended by representatives from approximately 70 countries and international organizations. The pledge that was signed outlines shared principles among participants, reaffirms strong support for Ukraine&#x2019;s victory, and condemns any nation aiding Russia&apos;s aggression. Key agreements include enhancing Ukraine&apos;s collaboration with international partners to address humanitarian issues and compliance with the Geneva Conventions, as well as identifying trusted mediating states for negotiations regarding the return of Ukrainian military personnel, civilians, and children. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha highlighted the conference&apos;s tangible outcomes, particularly commitments from specific countries to assist in returning children. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly noted that Qatar, the Vatican, South Africa, Lithuania, and the UAE have made specific pledges to aid in the return of deported individuals. Additionally, a coalition of countries will be formed to gather information about captured Ukrainians and assist in data verification. The conference participants also committed to supporting Ukraine in reintegrating those who eventually return, and raising awareness about Russia&apos;s unlawful detentions and deportations. Russian authorities and their collaborators have illegally deported thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories to Russia. At least 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Russia also holds thousands of Ukrainian prisoners of war, with 3,672 of them having been successfully brought back from captivity. The United Nations commission has published several reports describing the torture of Ukrainian POWs as &#x201C;widespread and systematic,&#x201D; and the conditions of their detention as &quot;shocking.&quot; Some Ukrainian POWs have died in captivity from causes such as &quot;blunt force trauma&quot;.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-45-countries-pledge-support-at-montreal-conference-for-the-return-of-ukrainian-captives-and-deportees/	2024-10-31T22:27:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1749110905.jpg
Negotiations between Ukraine and China underway to expand agricultural exports	Ukraine is currently in discussions with China to expand exports of various agricultural products, according to Oleh Osiian, the First Deputy Head of the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection. Osiian noted that the intention is to establish seven new markets, and for Ukraine to export peas, wheat flour, livestock feed, beef, corn, poultry, and wild-caught aquatic products. The protocols for these exports are at different stages of development and approval, with the pea protocol nearing completion in Ukraine and awaiting consideration by Chinese authorities. Draft protocols for poultry and fish are also under review, while the protocol for wild-caught aquatic products has passed domestic approval and is pending final approval from China. Meanwhile, China&apos;s already robust economic ties with Russia have grown stronger since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Trade between Russia and China has surged by 121% since 2021, underscoring the Chinese role as Moscow&apos;s economic lifeline. China&#x2019;s official position on the war has been &#x201C;neutral,&quot; and Beijing has tried to play both sides in order to maximize economic benefit and increase geopolitical influence.	https://kyivindependent.com/negotiations-between-ukraine-and-china-underway-to-expand-agricultural-exports/	2024-10-31T20:02:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/W020240724564401152035.jpg
A war of two countries against one' — Zelensky urges Western allies to take decisive action on North Korean troop involvement	In a lengthy post on social media on Oct. 31, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western allies to develop &quot;concrete solutions&quot; to provide additional supports for Ukraine as North Korean troops prepare to engage Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast in late October in preparations to fight alongside Russian troops. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31 that at least 8,000 North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war. &quot;North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat, but this is a matter of days, not months,&quot; Zelensky wrote in his post on X. &quot;When deployed, they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.&quot; According to Blinken, Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they &quot;fully intend&quot; to use these forces in front-line operations. Urging Western powers to stand united behind Ukraine, Zelensky said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was &quot;testing the world&#x2019;s reaction&quot; with the influx of North Korean troops along the country&apos;s border. Zelensky&apos;s comments, made ahead of an interview on South Korean television, are aimed at encouraging allies, including South Korea, to reconsider their positions in light of the deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The statement comes as Kyiv prepares for a visit from a South Korean delegation seeking to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. &quot;We are particularly interested in South Korea&#x2019;s expertise in air defense and hope to collaborate further in the defense sector,&quot; Zelensky wrote. Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean presidential official, that the country is not currently considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine. Experts previously told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. Ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, Zelensky also called on the next U.S. president to maintain the country&apos;s commitment to back Ukraine: &quot;The next U.S. president may strengthen or weaken support for Ukraine. If that support weakens, Russia will seize more territory, it would prevent us from winning this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;A genuine desire from the United States to end this war swiftly is crucial.&quot; While Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has criticized calls for concessions from Ukraine, Republican candidate Donald Trump has suggested that Ukraine could cede territory in exchange for peace. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s territories are not negotiable. Our constitution doesn&#x2019;t allow us to abandon our rightful lands, regardless of Russia&#x2019;s claims or constitutional manipulations,&quot; Zelensky added. Amid increased military casualties and concern over the Russian public&apos;s reaction to domestic mobilization, Putin visited Pyongyang in June to ratchet up support for Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine &#x2014; signing a mutual defense pact with the country&apos;s dictator Kim Jung-Un. In his post, Zelensky called for new military alliances to emerge to counter the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. &quot;It may be time for an Asian Security Alliance,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Both Japan and South Korea are strong, civilized nations, and reaching out to China could be essential in countering North Korea&#x2019;s aggression, as North Korea is actively pulling that region into a war.&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been urging China, which maintains relations with North Korea, to put pressure on Pyongyang to withdraw North Korean troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. &quot;I&#x2019;m surprised by China&#x2019;s silence. I can&#x2019;t say that China is on our side, but as a regional security guarantor, its silence is striking,&quot; Zelensky said on social media. Despite the urging of the United States, some Western officials are pessimistic about the country&apos;s ability to pressure China into helping pull back North Korean troops, with a NATO official telling CNN that China has been a &quot;critical enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine On Oct. 24, China denied that it was of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite warnings from the U.S. and South Korea. As Ukraine continues to fight off Russian attacks along its easter front, it will soon be forced to fend off attacks from another aggressor &#x2014; as world leaders continue to deliver &quot;only bold political statements,&quot; and not concrete actions, Zelensky said. &quot;(Putin) is testing the West, NATO, and even South Korea, observing their response to North Korean forces joining his campaign. If the response is weak, we should expect the numbers of foreign soldiers on our soil to increase.&quot; Ukraine has said that North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. Despite North Korean troops not having any live combat experience, Zelensky argues that they are gaining &quot;invaluable combat experience, learning artillery, drone warfare, and modern combat tactics&quot; &#x2014; warning that what is happening in Ukraine may one day occur elsewhere. &quot;Consider how close North Korea is to Seoul&#x2014;just 40-50 km, the range of modern artillery, not even missiles,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;Our own towns were obliterated by artillery. I hope South Korea never faces this, but preparation is critical.&quot; Fearing that little action will be taken to curb a major escalation in the war, Zelensky invoked memories of world leader&apos;s unwillingness to act to prevent an imminent full-scale war. &quot;When Russia invaded and occupied Crimea ten years ago, there was little global reaction, aside from a few quiet statements. It&#x2019;s the same today with North Korea&#x2019;s involvement,&quot; the president wrote. Despite Zelensky&apos;s outcry, some experts fear the damage has already been done. &quot;When North Korea began supplying Russia with artillery shells in late 2022, the West took no action. A year later, the first reports started to emerge of Russia launching North Korean ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets,&quot; Peter Dickinson, an expert at the Atlantic Council wrote. Now, Ukraine not only has to contend with a Russian army that seeks to increase its fighting force by 180,000 troops, but a North Korean regime that gains &quot;military technologies and the invaluable experience of its people,&quot; Zelensky concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-war-of-two-countries-against-one-zelensky-says-as-he-urges-decisive-actions-from-western-allies-on-north-korean-troop/	2024-10-31T18:07:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GbPXWpybwAAnmyl.jpg
Ukraine, Hungary preparing bilateral document 'to clear up misunderstandings,' Zelensky says	Kyiv is preparing a bilateral cooperation document with Budapest &quot;to clear up misunderstandings&quot; between the two countries on an number of issues, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. No information was provided on what specific agreements the bilateral document seeks to reach, however, Zelensky said that the document would likely involve issues pertaining to national minorities as well as security cooperation. &quot;The least we ask of Hungary is not to block Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO. That is, do not support, do not vote for us, and do not block,&quot; Zelensky said during a conference with community leaders in western Ukraine. Relations between Kyiv and Budapest have continued to sour as Hungary, led by strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. On Oct. 17, Orban referred to Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan, which includes NATO accession atop of the list, as &quot;more than terrifying.&quot; In a socia media post, Orban urged the EU to change its strategy regarding the war in Ukraine and reiterated calls for &quot;a ceasefire and peace talks.&quot; &quot;There are many things there to clear up misunderstandings or to answer the challenges of the present, the future and the past,&quot; Zelensky said in regards to the document being prepared. Zelensky added resolving issues related to national minorities should be addressed &quot;so that no issues arise between our states.&quot; Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian leadership denies. The two countries have in recent months sought to mend relations on the issue. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 30 after talks with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto in Budapest that both sides see &quot;positive dynamics&quot; in resolving issues related to national minorities, as reported by European Pravda. In September 2023, the Ukrainian parliament approved changes to national minorities law, which was one of seven steps recommended by the European Commission in June 2022 for Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union. The changes were signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelensky in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hungary-preparing-bilateral-document-to-clear-up-misunderstandings-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T17:42:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/7c19fbac71d9006321d6f6e2b6c17459_1719918827_extra_large.jpeg
Ukrainian drone strikes Russian oil refinery 1,500 km from border, Russian official claims	A Ukrainian drone struck an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, the head of the republic, Radiy Khabirov, said on Oct. 31. According to Khabirov, three Ukrainian drones fell within the facility of the oil refinery, with one falling on the refinery itself. The drone caused minimal damage with no casualties reported, Khabirov claimed. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the claims of the official and Ukraine has not yet commented on the alleged attack. The incident appears to be just the second time since the start of the full-scale invasion that Ukrainian drones attacked facilities in Bashkortostan which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the country&apos;s border. On May 9, a Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) source told the Kyiv Independent that a long-range drone operated by the SBU attacked the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat oil refinery. It was not immediately clear to which refinery the drone allegedly fell on during the most recent attack. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry beginning in the spring of 2024. The alleged strikes comes as Ukraine and Russia are reportedly holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 &#x2014; although Russia has denied being involved in the talks. In a show of strength, Kyiv has regularly attempted to strike long-distance targets since the start of the war. In April, Ukraine hit production facilities in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan Republic, 1,300 kilometers away from the state border, while in September, Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian drones attacked targets in Murmansk Oblast, located behind the Arctic Circle. Ukraine&apos;s Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said in April that the country has domestically-produced attack drones capable of flying over 1,000 kilometers, as Kyiv intensifies its efforts to ramp up domestic production of drones. Fossil fuels are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Despite Western sanctions, Russia still provides oil and gas to other countries around the world, primarily India and China.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strikes-russian-oil-refinery-1-500-km-from-ukrainian-border-russian-official-claims/	2024-10-31T15:10:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/backfire.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia confirms North Korea's involvement in war to West, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 31: Russia has confirmed to the West that North Korea is taking an active part in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the South Korean KBS TV channel published on Oct. 31. He said the messages were passed through the country&apos;s intelligence. &quot;The Russian Federation at the level of intelligence confirmed that North Korea is involved (in the war) ... (Russia) has been talking about this with the West.&quot; North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as the Pentagon, confirmed on Oct. 28. &quot;Two states are officially at war against Ukraine. The military is officially involved. This is not just the transfer of artillery shells, assistance with the appropriate number of missiles, or the involvement of technical personnel working at factories,&quot; Zelensky said. Some 3,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, Kyiv expects their number to increase to 12,000, Zelensky said. The president said that some of the North Korean military is also located in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories without specifying the region. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, but this is &quot;a matter of days, not months,&quot; according to Zelensky. &quot;Russia really wants us to leave Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia has concentrated about 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast and will increase (their number). They (Russians) are pulling North Korean troops there. They don&apos;t have enough.&quot; According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine this week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war. Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, Blinken said, adding that they can happen &quot;in the coming days.&quot; &quot;One of the reasons that Russia is turning to these North Korean troops is that it&apos;s desperate. (Vladimir) Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine. Now he&apos;s turning to North Korean troops, and that is a clear sign of weakness,&quot; Blinken said. Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they &quot;fully intend&quot; to use these forces in front-line operations, according to Blinken. &quot;Should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.&quot; Blinken added that the U.S. will announce more military assistance for Ukraine &quot;soon.&quot; The U.S. has transferred nearly 10% of the aid approved by Congress in April 2024 to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference on Oct. 30. After months of political infighting and a worsening situation on the battlefield, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed the foreign aid package on April 20, which included $60.84 billion in support for Ukraine. &quot;You do your job. You count on reserves, you count on special brigades, you count on such equipment. And if you get 10% of all the package (that) has already been voted on... It&apos;s not funny,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If you give your word, you have to keep it,&quot; he added, noting that Ukraine had planned its military actions relying on the promised assistance &quot;at a certain time.&quot; Zelensky also said NATO was not ready to take specific steps toward Ukraine&#x2019;s membership due to Russian aggression, but the alliance had promised to provide &#x201C;six or seven&#x201D; air defense systems to protect Ukraine&apos;s airspace. &quot;But today, we haven&apos;t received this number. If we still haven&apos;t received it and we can&apos;t count on this great support for air defense during the heating season, which has already begun in Ukraine... What can we do?&quot; The U.S. recently allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July that Warsaw may provide Kyiv with additional Soviet-made fighter jets if it can find a replacement. Following Zelensky&apos;s calls to speed up the transfer, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said, &quot;Poland makes decisions based on its security and has already done everything it can for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We agreed with NATO that they would provide them (Poland) with a police mission, just like our Baltic friends, who do not have their own planes but have such a mission,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No. Was there another reason? Yes,&quot; the president said without providing further details. Zelensky added that Ukraine has &quot;constantly asked&quot; Poland to shoot down Russian missiles flying in its direction, particularly to protect the gas storage facility in the town of Stryi in Ukraine&apos;s Lviv Oblast, located nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Ukrainian-Polish border. &quot;We do not have the appropriate number of (air defense) systems to protect the gas storage facility. What about the Poles? Are they shooting it down? No. The Poles said we are ready to shoot down if we are not alone in this decision; if NATO supports us.&quot; Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. Yet, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Tusk. In early July, Ukraine and Poland signed a bilateral security agreement, which included a commitment by both sides to examine &quot;the feasibility of possible intercepting in Ukraine&apos;s airspace missiles and UAVs fired in the direction of the territory of Poland, following necessary procedures agreed by the states and organizations involved.&quot; Then NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was skeptical about this point of the agreement, saying that it puts the alliance at risk of &quot;becoming part of the conflict.&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski began to insist on Poland&apos;s right to shoot down air targets after a Russian drone reportedly crossed the country&apos;s border in an attack against Ukraine on Aug. 26. The minister said that the risk of Polish casualties increases the closer a missile is to its target when intercepted, so it was better to shoot it down at a higher altitude over Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31, allocating approximately 26% of the country&apos;s GDP to defense and military spending. &quot;The priority of next year&apos;s budget will again be security and defense. All taxes paid by people and businesses will go toward strengthening our defenders and military capabilities,&quot; Prime Minister Denys Smyhal said on his Telegram channel. Military and defense spending will grow by Hr 46 billion ($1.6 billion) compared to 2024, reaching over Hr 2.2 trillion ($53.4 billion). According to Shmyhal, state spending will increase by Hr 535 billion ($13 billion) to Hr 3.6 trillion ($87.4 billion), while revenues are expected to reach around Hr 2.7 billion ($65.5 million), up Hr 411 billion ($10 billion) from 2024. &quot;Not a single amendment to meet the needs of the military, and those who today especially need state support, was taken into account,&quot; opposition lawmaker Dmytro Razumkov said, criticizing the document on his Telegram channel. Following today&apos;s discussions, the budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1. Ukraine&apos;s state budget has increasingly relied on external support, including war bonds, IFI loans, and bilateral loans and grants, as the country&apos;s war-torn economy falters. A widening annual budget deficit, reaching 20.6% in 2023, led Ukrainian lawmakers to approve a tax hike in September&#x2014;the first since the full-scale war began&#x2014;a politically unpopular move as the country seeks new sources of funding for its expanding wartime budget. Ukraine faces a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and with Russia&apos;s war continuing into its third year with no end in sight, the country must secure funding to sustain its economy and finance the war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-confirms-north-koreas-involvement-in-war-to-west-kyiv-says/	2024-10-31T13:35:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157775748.jpg
8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk Oblast, Blinken says	Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, Blinken said, adding that they can happen &quot;in the coming days.&quot; &quot;One of the reasons that Russia is turning to these North Korean troops is that it&apos;s desperate. (Vladimir) Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine. Now he&apos;s turning to North Korean troops, and that is a clear sign of weakness,&quot; Blinken said. Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they &quot;fully intend&quot; to use these forces in front-line operations, according to Blinken. &quot;Should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.&quot; Blinken added that the U.S. will announce more military assistance for Ukraine &quot;soon.&quot; According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine this week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-000-north-korean-troops-have-been-deployed-to-kursk-oblast-blinken-says/	2024-10-31T12:43:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160942758.jpg
Russia's next mass missile attack on Kyiv likely imminent, experts and weary residents say	Russia&apos;s aerial attacks against Kyiv have changed dramatically in recent weeks, becoming far more frequent yet far less destructive. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes on the capital &#x2014; which overnight on Oct. 31 was attacked for the 20th time this month &#x2014; and the rest of the country, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. The last combined mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv was nearly two months ago. While on the surface, this may seem like a positive development, for the capital&apos;s residents, it is stirring up a sense of unease. &quot;I think this is a target practice before winter,&quot; 32-year-old Kyiv school teacher Zakhar Shevchuk told the Kyiv Independent &quot;I think there will be missiles, drones &#x2014; everything combined because there have been no missiles for a long time, but there are a lot of drones.&quot; This photograph shows smoke billowing from the International Academy of Personnel Management following a missile attack in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 2, 2024 (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Residents stay outside an apartment block in the Solomianskyi district hit by a Russian drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine on Oct. 25, 2024.

(Serhii Chuzavkov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Ukrainian officials have for months been warning of a renewed effort by Russia to destroy the country&apos;s energy infrastructure after a series of devastating strikes between March and August of this year severely damaged many of the country&#x2019;s thermal power plants, and grid connection of generation from hydroelectricity producers. The country, as a result, is heavily dependent on power produced by nuclear power plants as well as imports. &quot;The winter will be the hardest of the last three years,&quot; the interim head of Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo, Oleksiy Brekht, said in an interview with Suspilne on Oct. 29. He added that if Russia continues its onslaught of attacks against critical energy infrastructure as it did last winter, then Ukrainians may face up to eight hours of power outages on the most &quot;critical&quot; days. According to a report by the Financial Times (FT), Kyiv and Moscow are holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure after earlier talks fell through following Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. A senior Ukrainian official cited in the report said energy infrastructure attacks have already decreased in the past few weeks, based on a deal established through Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s respective intelligence agencies. Moscow has denied the reports of negotiations.

(Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Liubov Bondar, 75, a retired worker at a maritime shipping company, told the Kyiv Independent that even if the negotiation reports were accurate, they would not be effective. &quot;Can we really trust (Russian President Vladimir) Putin?&quot; she asked, adding: &quot;He doesn&apos;t like the fact that our guys are hitting oil refineries. &quot;I don&apos;t believe him &#x2014; whatever he says, he will lie.&#x201D; While the number of missiles Russia has launched against Ukraine has dropped dramatically since the last mass attack on Sept. 2, the number of kamikaze drones has surged to unprecedented levels. September was the first month since the start of the full-scale invasion that Ukraine was attacked by Shahed-type drones every single day, with more than 1,300 being launched. This has only escalated during October, with the month&apos;s total surpassing September on Oct. 23. The vast majority are shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare. An infographics showing the number of Russian missiles and drones launched against Ukraine during 2024 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)&quot;The attacks have increased. It&#x2019;s bad, but it is what it is,&quot; said 44-year-old Olena Syrotina, who has lived in Kyiv since 2015 when she was forced to flee Luhansk after Russia&apos;s 2014 invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Now I can even hear (the drone&#x2019;s) buzz in my apartment. Before this month, it had never happened. &quot;I sleep, but when air defenses are shooting, and the light flashes in my windows, I wake up and go to the corridor.&quot; Syrotina is right to be cautious &#x2014; two people including a 15-year-old girl have been killed in the capital in recent days. Though drones have inflicted far less damage than some of Russia&apos;s mass missile strikes, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&#x201D; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot; Oleksandr Kharchenko, the managing director of the Energy Industry Research (EIR) Center, told the Kyiv Independent that making any predictions about Russia&apos;s next mass missile attack on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure is virtually impossible. &quot;We can&apos;t say for sure what objects will be attacked, how it will be attacked, or how effective the air defenses will be in this situation,&quot; he said. But he added that attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy generation would have a more significant impact than attacks on the country&apos;s power grid. Last month in New York, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. A few days earlier, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; According to Kharchenko, an attack on Ukraine&apos;s nuclear sites would lead to a &quot;very, very complicated situation.&quot; The cooling towers of the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant are seen in Varash, Ukraine on March 25, 2022. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post via Getty Images)There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Kharchenko said they account for &quot;55-60% of electricity consumption.&quot; &quot;If a nuclear station&apos;s switchyard was attacked, damaged, or destroyed, it would be very painful,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you lose even one station from the grid, it means that you have lost it for three or four weeks because restoring the switchyards takes this long to repair.&quot; Guessing when the next big attack will occur is currently a pastime of experts and citizens in the capital. &quot;Well, first of all, you have to ask the Russians because they are absolutely out of common sense logic,&quot; Kharchenko said when asked when he thinks it might be. Several Telegram channels monitor the activities of Russian bomber aircraft based at airbases used to attack Ukraine. One of the latest reports noted a significant number massing at various airbases, adding to speculation in Kyiv of a possible imminent attack, but still with no clear conclusions. &quot;I watch the news, I watch different analysts (to hear) their predictions because no one fully knows what&apos;s in (the Russians&apos;) heads,&quot; said Shevchuk, the Kyiv school teacher. Weather forecasts are also closely followed because, as Kkarchenko explains, attacking Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure when the temperatures drop would likely cause more damage and more detrimental effects to the country&#x2019;s economic stability and war efforts. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely possible that they&apos;re really waiting for freezing cold temperatures,&quot; he said. Increased demand in colder weather would place much more significant strain on a damaged system, leading to more blackouts and restrictions, according to Kharchenko. &quot;It&apos;s also more complicated to repair something when you have freezing temperatures,&quot; he added. All that is left for Kyiv&apos;s residents is to prepare as best they can. Large generators have appeared on streets all over Kyiv as shops, restaurants, and bars take measures to ensure they can stay open during blackouts. Countless smaller systems have appeared in homes across the capital. &quot;I&apos;m expecting blackouts,&quot; 28-year-old Alina Malynovska told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I have a battery and an inverter. It&apos;s like a home charging station for everything.&quot; But some Ukrainians see advantages to power cuts in colder weather. &quot;In winter, it will be a little better because we can keep food on the balcony,&quot; Bondar, the pensioner, said. &quot;(In summer) the food was spoiling in the refrigerator.&quot; Despite the trepidation about the upcoming winter, those living in Kyiv have grimly experienced such hardships. &quot;Somehow I lived through last winter,&quot; 45-year-old Yurii told the Kyiv Independent, adding: &quot;We&#x2019;ll survive this one too.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-next-mass-missile-attack-on-kyiv-likely-imminent-experts-and-weary-residents-say/	2024-10-31T12:27:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181049107.jpg
Russia carried out at least 36 double-tap strikes in Ukraine, killing over 100 people since 2022, report says	The Russian military carried out at least 36 double-tap strikes against Ukraine from the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 to August 2024, killing over 100 people, according to a recent report by Truth Hounds, a Ukrainian non-profit organization that documents and investigates war crimes. Twenty such attacks were carried out this year alone. A double-tap attack is an illegal military tactic in which an initial strike is followed by a delayed second strike, usually intended to kill or injure first responders who arrive at the scene and cause panic among the population. Russia has been using this tactic extensively in Ukraine and previously in Syria alongside Bashar al-Assad&apos;s government forces. According to Truth Hounds, their report confirms that Moscow deliberately uses double-tap attacks to hinder humanitarian aid efforts, with Russian propaganda framing the killing of Ukrainian first responders as justified. Truth Hounds verified 36 cases of Russian double-tap strikes, although the overall number of incidents displaying the characteristics of double-tap attacks exceeds 60. A map with the verified Russian double-tap strikes in Ukraine from&#x2028;February 24, 2022 &#x2014; August 31, 2024. (Truth Hounds)According to the report titled &quot;Cruelty Cascade: Examining the Pattern of Russian Double-Tap Strikes in Ukraine,&quot; Russian forces have dramatically increased the use of this tactic in 2024, with instances this year alone surpassing the verified cases from the previous two years combined. Over 100 people were killed in the 36 double-tap attacks, verified by Truth Hounds, but it is unclear how many of them died as a result of the secondary strikes, Roman Koval, the organization&#x2019;s head of research, told the Kyiv Independent. In July 2024, Andrii Danyk, the head of Ukraine&#x2019;s State Emergency Service, reported that 93 emergency workers had been killed and almost 400 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion, though not all of these casualties had resulted from Russia&apos;s double-tap attacks. Russian double-tap strikes wounded nearly 350 civilians from April 2022 to April 2024, said Timothy Hanway, the acting U.S. envoy to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in an address on April 25. Hanway also highlighted that Russia&apos;s usage of this illegal tactic had been increasing. &#xA0; Since 2014, Truth Hounds has been documenting and investigating international crimes and severe human rights violations across Ukraine and other conflict zones in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Their latest report delves into the pattern and impact of Russian double-tap strikes in Ukraine, offering a legal assessment of these actions and their implications.

(Ivan Samoilov/Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)In collaboration with the White Helmets &#x2014; a humanitarian organization focused on helping communities prepare for, respond to, and rebuild after attacks in Syria &#x2014; Truth Hounds established &#x201C;a strong connection&#x201D; between Russia&apos;s use of double-tap attacks in Syria and Ukraine, according to the organization&#x2019;s press release. In July 2023, the White Helmets reported having lost over 300 volunteers in the Syrian war, with the majority killed in double-tap attacks. In an earlier comment for the Kyiv Independent, Janine di Giovanni, a human rights reporter and investigator with over 30 years of experience working in war zones, called Russian double-tap attacks &#x201C;a part of a larger strategy of punishment and control,&quot; noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x201C;has a pattern of attacking civilians indiscriminately.&#x201D; Truth Hounds suggested in the report that the rise of Russian double-tap attacks in 2024 could be linked to the appointment of a new commander of the Russian Missile Troops and Artillery, along with a new head of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry. &#x201C;This fact warrants further investigation to uncover the underlying interdependencies, including potential shifts in operational strategy or tactical priorities under their leadership.&#x201D; The report also assesses the conditions under which double-tap strikes could be considered war crimes. These attacks violate the provisions of the Rome Statute, which explicitly forbids intentional targeting of civilians, and violate the article protecting medical and humanitarian personnel from attacks. &quot;Our research has thoroughly demonstrated that even if the first strike targets a legitimate military target, the second strike &#x2014; typically delayed and aimed at rescuers and wounded personnel &#x2014; crosses the line of legality, transforming these actions into war crimes,&quot; said Yuriy Uhryn, a lawyer at Truth Hounds, in a press release shared by the organization. Based on the report, Truth Hounds outlined a set of recommendations for the Ukrainian and foreign governments, international organizations, and the International Criminal Court. These include investigating Russian double-tap strikes in both Ukraine and Syria, increasing support for Ukrainian and Syrian first responders, promoting public condemnation of these war crimes, and advocating for stronger sanctions against Russia. &#x201C;The current situation highlights a critical pattern: impunity for international crimes tends to facilitate their recurrence, placing civilians in increasingly precarious positions,&#x201D; Truth Hounds said in a statement. &#x201C;The absence of effective measures to address such violations undermines international norms and emboldens those who commit these acts.&#x201D; Ukrainian authorities recorded almost 140,000 war crimes committed by Russian troops in the country, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the United for Justice conference in Kyiv on Sept. 11. Slightly over 100 people were found guilty of war crimes as of late March, most of them in absentia, according to Zmina, a Ukrainian human rights organization. Truth Hounds believes it&#x2019;s crucial to continue investigating Russian double-tap attacks and prosecuting the perpetrators. &#x201C;People who lost their loved ones to such attacks or were directly affected by them demand justice, and even if this demand can be satisfied only partially through sentences in absentia, it is still worth doing,&#x201D; said Koval. &#x201C;Russian suspects in war crimes still travel abroad, and such cases are not isolated. Considering that war crimes do not have a statute of limitations, this also significantly increases the chances of their arrest when they leave Russia sooner or later.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-carried-out-at-least-36-double-tap-strikes-in-ukraine/	2024-10-31T12:13:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2079435110-2.jpg
Kyiv won't stop supporting wartime pool of TV channels before martial law ends	The Ukrainian government doesn&apos;t plan to stop supporting the telethon, Ukraine&apos;s state-run pool of TV channels created during wartime, before the end of the martial law, Interfax Ukraine reported on Oct. 31, citing Culture Minister Mykola Tochytskyi. The comment comes after the European Commission criticized the telethon on Oct. 30, urging Kyiv to restore a &quot;pluralistic media landscape.&quot; Tochytskyi said Ukraine &quot;has taken into account&quot; the European Commission&apos;s recommendations. Brussels expects Ukraine to restore the work of all broadcasters in the pre-war format, questioning the telethon&apos;s objectivity. One of the European Commission&apos;s criticisms concerns the financing of the telethon from the state budget. &quot;We have already begun the path of change: step by step, we are ensuring that every citizen has access to public information and are actively engaging the resources of international partners to support the restoration of Ukrainian media,&quot; Tochytskyi said. The European Commission&apos;s recommendations have been &quot;taken into account,&quot; he went on. &quot;The state plans to stop supporting the telethon after the end of martial law, focusing on the sustainable development of media infrastructure.&quot; The so-called telethon, branded as &quot;Yedyni Novyny&quot; (&quot;United News&quot;), was launched at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. It was created by merging the coverage of Ukraine&apos;s biggest TV channels. The telethon was initially seen as a legitimate response to Russia&apos;s aggression, but later, it was accused of monopolizing television coverage and stifling dissent. Some opposition television channels have complained that they were excluded from the telethon due to their political stance. Suspilne, a Ukrainian public broadcaster, said on May 21 that it had launched its own news broadcasting on the Pershyi nationwide TV channel separate from the telethon. Mykola Chernotytskyi, the head of Suspilne&apos;s Managing Board, clarified later that the company de jure remains part of the telethon but will no longer be represented in its time slots. Prior to that, Suspilne&apos;s Supervisory Board Chairwoman Svitlana Ostapa said on Facebook that Suspilne was being pulled out from the telethon&apos;s prime-time evening slots.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-wont-stop-supporting-wartime-pool-of-tv-channels-before-martial-law-ends/	2024-10-31T11:54:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2053129369.jpg
Kyiv still waiting for MiG-29 fighter jets from Warsaw, Zelensky says	Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July that Warsaw may provide Kyiv with additional Soviet-made fighter jets if it can find a replacement.

What about the Poles? Are they shooting it down? No. The Poles said we are ready to shoot down if we are not alone in this decision; if NATO supports us.&quot; Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine.

Russia confirms North Korea's involvement in war to West, Zelensky says	Russia has confirmed to the West that North Korea is taking an active part in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the South Korean KBS TV channel published on Oct. 31. He said the messages were passed through the country&apos;s intelligence. &quot;The Russian Federation at the level of intelligence confirmed that North Korea is involved (in the war) ... (Russia) has been talking about this with the West.&quot; North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as the Pentagon, confirmed on Oct. 28. &quot;Two states are officially at war against Ukraine. The military is officially involved. This is not just the transfer of artillery shells, assistance with the appropriate number of missiles, or the involvement of technical personnel working at factories,&quot; Zelensky said. Some 3,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, Kyiv expects their number to increase to 12,000, Zelensky said. The president said that some of the North Korean military is also located in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories without specifying the region. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, but this is &quot;a matter of days, not months,&quot; according to Zelensky. &quot;Russia really wants us to leave Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia has concentrated about 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast and will increase (their number). They (Russians) are pulling North Korean troops there. They don&apos;t have enough.&quot; According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official.

Ukraine has received just 10% of US aid approved by Congress earlier this year, Zelensky says	The U.S. has transferred nearly 10% of the aid approved by Congress in April 2024 to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference on Oct. 30. After months of political infighting and a worsening situation on the battlefield, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed the foreign aid package on April 20, which included $60.84 billion in support for Ukraine. &quot;You do your job. You count on reserves, you count on special brigades, you count on such equipment. And if you get 10% of all the package (that) has already been voted on... It&apos;s not funny,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If you give your word, you have to keep it,&quot; he added, noting that Ukraine had planned its military actions relying on the promised assistance &quot;at a certain time.&quot; Zelensky also said NATO was not ready to take specific steps toward Ukraine&#x2019;s membership due to Russian aggression, but the alliance had promised to provide &#x201C;six or seven&#x201D; air defense systems to protect Ukraine&apos;s airspace. &quot;But today, we haven&apos;t received this number. If we still haven&apos;t received it and we can&apos;t count on this great support for air defense during the heating season, which has already begun in Ukraine... What can we do?&quot; The U.S. recently allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-received-just-10-of-us-aid-approved-by-congress-earlier-this-year-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T08:45:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
Ukraine’s 2025 budget clears first reading, allocates $53 billion for defense	Ukraine&#x2019;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31, allocating approximately 26% of the country&#x2019;s GDP to defense and military spending. &#x201C;The priority of next year&apos;s budget will also be security and defense. All taxes paid by people and businesses will go toward strengthening our defenders and military capabilities,&#x201D; Prime Minister Denys Smyhal said on his Telegram channel. Military and defense spending will grow by Hr 46 billion ($1.6 billion) compared to 2024, reaching over Hr 2.2 trillion ($53.4 billion). According to Shmyhal, state spending will increase by Hr 535 billion ($13 billion) to Hr 3.6 trillion ($87.4 billion), while revenues are expected to reach around Hr 2.7 billion ($65.5 million), up Hr 411 billion ($10 billion) from 2024. &#x201C;Not a single amendment to meet the needs of the military, and those who today especially need state support, was taken into account,&#x201D; opposition lawmaker Dmytro Razumkov said, criticizing the document on his Telegram channel. Following today&#x2019;s discussions, the budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1. Ukraine&#x2019;s state budget has increasingly relied on external support, including war bonds, IFI loans, and bilateral loans and grants, as the country&#x2019;s war-torn economy falters. A widening annual budget deficit, reaching 20.6% in 2023, led Ukrainian lawmakers to approve a tax hike in September&#x2014;the first since the full-scale war began&#x2014;a politically unpopular move as the country seeks new sources of funding for its expanding wartime budget. Ukraine faces a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and with Russia&#x2019;s war continuing into its third year with no end in sight, the country must secure funding to sustain its economy and finance the war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-2025-budget-clears-first-reading-allocates-53-billion-for-defense/	2024-10-31T07:33:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
National Bank of Ukraine leaves interest rates unchanged at 13%	The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has kept interest rates on hold at 13%, it announced on Oct. 31. The decision was in line with analysts&#x2019; predictions, and comes as Ukraine braces for next week&#x2019;s U.S. presidential election, Bloomberg reported. &#x201C;Given that inflation has not yet peaked, and that pro-inflationary risks have even increased for the coming months, the NBU believes it appropriate to remain cautious,&#x201D; the NBU said in a statement. Policymakers refrained from cutting for the third consecutive month, part of an attempt to contain accelerating annual inflation, and uphold the stability of the domestic currency. &#x201C;In September, inflation accelerated to 8.6% year-on-year, and continued to rise in October,&#x201D; the NBU said in its statement. Higher than expected inflation was caused by a smaller than expected harvest, a weakening currency, and the rising cost of electricity and labor, the statement said. &#x201C;The war continues. Accordingly, the risks of a further decline in economic potential remain, in particular due to the loss of people, territories, and production facilities,&quot; it added. &#x201C;The speed of the economy&apos;s return to normal will depend on the nature and duration of the war.&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s economy is heavily reliant on U.S. aid, and the next week&apos;s presidential election and the possibility of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House raises much uncertainty. The NBU said it envisages maintaining rates at 13% until the summer of 2025. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 12 December 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-central-bank-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-at-13/	2024-10-31T07:20:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1401596737.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 9, injure 47 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least nine people and injured at least 47 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 31. Russia launched at least 50 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 17 across various regions, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said on Oct. 31. Two X-59/69 missiles were also downed. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening on Oct. 30, killing a man and two boys aged 12 and 15, and injuring at least 35 others. A Russian attack left a 14-year-old boy in the city of Dnipro with leg injuries, Serhii Lysak, head of the regional administration, said on his Telegram channel. In Donetsk Oblast, four people died in Uspenivka, Zarichne and Berestki, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. At least two injuries were reported in Shcherbynivka and Dalne. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and six others were injured following Russian strikes across the region targeting a library, an office building, and residential buildings, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Sumy Oblast&#x2019;s Khotinska village, Russian FPV drone strikes and mortar fire killed one civilian and injured three residents, the regional military administration reported. There were reports of strikes in Odesa, where Russia launched 10 missiles of various kinds, authorities said, though there were no reports of casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-at-least-9-injure-48-over-past-day/	2024-10-31T05:20:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-31-14_14_35.jpeg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine debates who serves and who doesn’t	The following is the Oct. 30, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Companies in Ukraine that were expecting to be able to &#x201C;reserve&#x201D; their employees to shield them from military service might not be able to do so starting mid-November. The government in Kyiv said over the last week that it is currently doing an audit of the exemption process until Nov. 15 to assess which businesses qualify for &quot;critical enterprise status&quot; that allows them to keep some employees from having to serve. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has allowed some men of conscription age to be spared from conscription as a way of keeping strategic sectors, including the defense industry, afloat and to curb the toll Russia&#x2019;s war has taken on the economy. But as the war extends into its third year, Ukraine is struggling to mobilize enough soldiers to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since 2022. It&#x2019;s a thorny issue in Ukraine, with some feeling it is unfair that others don&#x2019;t have to serve depending on their professions. It has also led to abuse of the system. Around 1.5 million people in Ukraine were exempt from military service in mid-August. President Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly unhappy with how high that figure is, as well as the fact that the number almost doubled over a couple of months, an unnamed high-ranking official in the Presidential Office told NV, leading to the decision to carry out the audit. &quot;The reason for the audit is the abnormal increase in the number of critical enterprises and the number of reserved employees. This is done in the interest of strengthening the country&apos;s defense capability and preventing abuses,&quot; the Cabinet of Ministers said. The government also said over the weekend that employees in &#x201C;strategically important sectors of the economy&#x201D; who received an exemption from military service before May 31, 2024 would be able to extend that status. Stay tuned for more developments on this front.

(Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Naftogaz wins against RussiaA Finnish court ruled in favor of Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz to seize Russian assets in Finland worth tens of millions of dollars as part of a claim against Russia over its annexation of Crimea, Naftogaz said on Oct. 28. A tribunal in The Hague ordered Russia in 2023 to pay $5 billion to Naftogaz as compensation for assets illegally seized during the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, but Russia had not yet done so. &quot;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the funds stipulated by The Hague decision, we continue to use all available mechanisms to collect them. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice,&quot; Naftogaz CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said following the Finnish court&#x2019;s decision. Finnish authorities began confiscating Russian state property on Oct. 28, the Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat reported, seizing the Russian Center of Science and Culture in Helsinki. Russia said it would challenge the decision in court, with Russian president&#x2019;s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling reporters that Moscow would &#x201C;use all legal mechanisms to protect our interests.&#x201D; Adnan Kivan. (Kadorr Group)Real estate mogul dies at 61Businessman Adnan Kivan, owner of the Kadorr Group and the English-language Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Post, passed away on Oct. 28, the group said in a statement. The Odesa-based millionaire and investor of Syrian origin would have turned 62 in December. The statement did not specify the cause of death. The Kadorr Group is known mainly for its construction and real estate projects. In 2021, Forbes Ukraine listed Kivan as the 42nd richest person in Ukraine with a fortune of $240 million. His group was also involved in agriculture and media. Kivan purchased the Kyiv Post in 2018 from British-Ukrainian businessman Mohammad Zahoor. Conflicts over editorial independence with the newsroom led to Kivan suspending the Kyiv Post and firing the staff in November 2021. The Kyiv Post&apos;s former editorial team founded the Kyiv Independent immediately after they were fired. It is now the largest English-language media outlet in the country.

(Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Cash for everyoneLate last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s government made a decision that gave everyone Covid flashbacks &#x2014; that every Ukrainian, including children, would receive a one-time payment of Hr 1,000 (around $24) &#x201C;to support the population in winter.&#x201D; But wait, isn&#x2019;t Ukraine&#x2019;s budget and military starving for money? According to the government, the payments will come from funds provided to Kyiv by its international partners that need to be used up before the end of the year and can&#x2019;t be directed to the military. The money will only be able to be spent on things like utilities, medicine, transport, cell phone plans, buying Ukrainian books, and other various services. The government has also said people can donate their money to the army, if they wish. It&#x2019;s unclear yet how much in funds will be disbursed, but one deputy economy minister said that a similar move during the Covid-19 pandemic cost the government around Hr 8 billion, or nearly $200 million. &#x201C;The final amount of this program for three winter months will depend on the number of Ukrainians who want to use this program. It is not possible to name the final amount now,&quot; deputy minister Oleksiy Sobolev said. Those who &#x201C;don&#x2019;t want&#x201D; to use the program may not want to have to go through the trouble of opening the special account they would have to in order to receive the funds. There have been lots of reactions, to some wondering why the government isn&#x2019;t directing the funds to investments, or to to low-income families, to others wondering how it&#x2019;ll work logistically to get money to children and the elderly that don&#x2019;t have easy access to bank services. The government defended its decision, with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal saying that the move has three major goals: financially support Ukrainian families, activate domestic demand for Ukrainian services, and &#x201C;demonstrate the unity of Ukrainian society for our stability and victory.&#x201D; If you live in Ukraine &#x2014; especially in Kyiv &#x2014; you know first hand that 24 bucks doesn&#x2019;t get you very far at all. Personally, I suspect many people will donate their money to the military.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Russia gets a pass, againAfter days of discussions, the world&#x2019;s leading anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), opted last week not to blacklist Russia despite efforts from Kyiv to sway members to do so over the Kremlin&#x2019;s increasingly closer ties with blacklisted North Korea and Iran. The FATF&#x2019;s decision to not blacklist Russia has instead again unearthed the lack of leadership among the West when it comes to curtailing Russia, Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market (EM) sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This should have been a slam dunk,&#x201D; he said. Read more here. Kernel &#x2014; one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest agricultural holdings &#x2014; said in a post on Facebook that for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion, it had received an $150-million loan from group of European banks, including Dutch commercial banks ING Bank and Co&#xF6;peratieve Rabobank, and the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. The funds will be used to support operations aimed at increasing exports of Ukrainian agricultural products, including sunflower oil, the company said. The Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. &quot;Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year,&quot; a statement from the G7 leaders read. The new factory of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which opened in late October in Ukraine, is a &quot;legitimate&quot; target for Russian attacks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian pro-state news agency Ria Novosti on Oct. 29. The facility, which is already operating in Ukraine at an undisclosed location, is set to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles by the end of the year, according to Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger. The Transmission System Operators of Continental Europe will increase their export capacity to Ukraine and Moldova by 400 megawatts (MW) to 2.1 gigawatts (GW) starting Dec. 1, allowing Ukraine to rely more heavily on electricity imports this winter when blackouts are expected. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, destroying 9 GW worth of capacity on Ukraine&apos;s grid. &quot;Nuclear proliferation is the biggest risk mankind faces,&quot; JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Oct. 24. According to Dimon, the West has to have clarity and subordinate many things &quot;to make sure that this ends up right.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-debates-who-serves-and-who-doesnt/	2024-10-31T03:58:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 152	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 152 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 13-24, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Updated IMF Memorandum. On Oct. 18, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published an updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) after its fifth review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s key commitments related to state-owned enterprises and banks are as follows: As we wrote in Issue 116, foreign investors were interested in buying Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. See Issue 146 for more detail. Currently, Roman Pionkowski is the only remaining independent member of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. He was appointed together with other independent members in December 2021, meaning that his term of office is expected to expire in December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry, in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting, decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the ministry added back then. Three weeks later, the Economy Ministry said that the SOE Nomination Committee approved the candidate requirements and announced the competitive selection for three board members (see Issue 151). The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. See Issues 129 and 151 for more detail. UDI gets a new CEO. On Oct. 21, Ukrainian Defenze Industry (UDI) announced that its supervisory board had appointed Oleg Gulyak as the company&#x2019;s new CEO, following a competitive selection process involving more than 20 applicants. As we wrote in Issue 146, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin resigned on Sept. 4 to become the new minister for strategic industries, replacing Oleksandr Kamyshin. UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board then appointed Oleg Gulyak as acting CEO and announced that it would launch a competitive selection for the new CEO as soon as possible. According to UDI, Gulyak has served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 1993. In 2021-2024, he was the Commander of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since July 1, he has served as a military cooperation advisor to UDI&#x2019;s CEO, strengthening the company&#x2019;s ties with the Defense Forces. See Issue 146 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 148, on Sept. 19, UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board launched a competitive selection for the CEO position. Candidates could apply from Sept. 20&#x2013;Oct. 4. Naftogaz Group paid Hr 67 billion ($1.6 billion) in taxes in January-September 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on Oct. 16. This includes Hr 61 billion ($1.5 billion) paid to the state budget and Hr 5 billion ($121 million) in contributions to local government budgets. In September alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 5.8 billion ($140 million) in state taxes, including Hr 600 million ($14.5 million) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid the following taxes to state and local budgets in the course of 2024: Month Taxes paid to state and local budgets SOE Weekly details &#xA0; UAH Euros* &#xA0; January 6.1 billion 147 million Issue 119 February 5.3 billion 129 million Issue 123 March 8.3 billion 197 million Issue 128 April 8.0 billion 189 million Issue 132 May 9.3 billion 215 million Issue 137 June 9.2 billion 203 million Issue 140 July 6.0 billion 132 million Issue 143 August 7.2 billion 174 million Issue 148 September 5.8 billion 129 million This issue * Converted at the National Bank of Ukraine&apos;s average exchange rate for the respective period. Calculations by SOE Weekly. As we reported in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($164 million) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($559 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022. See Issue 131 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 149, Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion (&#x20AC;578 million at the average exchange rate over that period) in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024. Ukrhydroenergo cancelled a tender to procure lawyers to seek compensation for the destroyed Kakhovka HPP, the company&#x2019;s press office announced on Oct. 15. The company said that this decision was made to ensure that the company&#x2019;s actions are in line with Ukraine&#x2019;s broader national strategy. This strategy aims to hold Russia accountable for the damage caused to critical infrastructure and ensure compensation for the destruction. In this context, additional consultations with the Cabinet of Ministers and other key stakeholders will be held to determine the most appropriate course of action in line with the national approach coordinated with Ukraine&#x2019;s international allies, Ukrhydroenergo explained. On June 6, 2023 Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 135, on June 6, Ukrhydroenergo announced that it initiated an investment arbitration procedure with Russia to compensate for the damage caused by the destruction of the HPP. The preliminary estimate was about $2.5 billion. As we reported in August 2024 (Issue 143), Ukrhydroenergo announced a tender to procure lawyers. The tender was scheduled for Oct. 17. Its expected value was Hr 365 million ($8.8 million). Twelfth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port to be made. According to Prozorro.Sale, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) scheduled an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport for Oct. 31. The starting price is Hr 178 million ($4.3 million). As we reported in Issue 148, in the previous attempt, the starting price was Hr 89 million ($2.1 million). It is unclear whether the asset whose starting price doubled will be able to attract bidders this time. This will be the twelfth attempt to sell the port. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around &#x20AC;5.6 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest decided not to make the payment. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed (see Issue 93).&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, the ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also failed (see Issue 147), as did the tenth and eleventh (see Issue 148). As we also wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. This suggested that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.2 million) in total. With the starting price now doubled, this would mean that the total amount to be paid for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi would amount to Hr 365 million ($8.8 million at the current exchange rate). For more detail, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, 147, and 148. SPFU puts seized AEROC up for privatization. On Oct. 15, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the terms of privatization for construction materials producer AEROC, with a starting price of Hr 965 million ($23 million). The next day, the SPFU set the date of the privatization auction. It is scheduled for Dec. 18. As we wrote earlier, SPFU planned to privatise AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrei Molchanov. See our Issues 97, 100, 106, and 110 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 140, on July 12, the Cabinet added AEROC to the large-scale privatization list. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and PRO-Consulting, AEROC is one of the largest aerated concrete producers in Ukraine. The company owns two plants in Obukhiv and Berezan (Kyiv oblast), which have been out of operation since July 2022. The capacity of these plants exceeds 1 million cubic meters per year, while total aerated concrete production in Ukraine in 2020 was 4 million cubic meters. AEROC also has an unfinished plant in Stryi (Lviv oblast), EP added.

Opinion: Rigged elections have stolen Georgia's European future	In Georgia&#x2019;s 2012 election, then-President Mikheil Saakashvili&#x2019;s pro-Western party was defeated by Georgian Dream, a party led by the Russian-backed oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili. Though widely hailed at the time as a democratic triumph, astute observers warned against celebrating. One such observer was Georgia&#x2019;s former economy minister, the late Kakha Bendukidze, a businessman and philanthropist who wryly remarked that with Ivanishvili&#x2019;s victory, the country &#x201C;made a step forward in terms of democracy, but sometimes when you make a step forward, you step in shit.&#x201D; When friends who supported Georgian Dream in 2012 assured me they would vote the party out of power if it failed to deliver, I warned them that doing so would be far harder than they expected. Unfortunately, as Georgia&#x2019;s Oct. 26 parliamentary elections showed, my prediction was accurate. According to independent polling organizations like Edison Research, which conducted both pre-election and exit polls, Georgian Dream was soundly defeated by a coalition of four opposition parties. But as we celebrated our victory, the Central Election Commission (CEC) abruptly reported results giving Ivanishvili&#x2019;s party a lead that exceeded the exit-poll numbers by around 15%. Post-election fatigue quickly gave way to deep confusion and uncertainty. Although we had received numerous reports of polling issues and other legal violations throughout the day, the full extent of the government&#x2019;s electoral fraud became clear after the official results were announced. In the lead-up to the election, the government introduced a new system of electronic voting machines. While many Georgians assumed that the government would make such a change only if it served its own interests, some NGOs, political parties, and international organizations believed that the new system provided stronger safeguards for free and fair elections. The skeptics were right. Although the Georgian opposition is still investigating the specifics of the government&#x2019;s electoral fraud, it is clear that Georgia has not witnessed such massive election interference since its first post-Soviet election 33 years ago. In Tbilisi and other large cities, Georgian Dream clearly lost. But in many rural areas the scale of manipulation seems staggering, and independent election-observer groups have called for annulment of the results in over 246 precincts&#x2014;covering more than 400,000 voters&#x2014;citing grave violations. Given that the new system did not manage to secure ballot secrecy, some NGOs are calling for total annulment of the results and new elections. Encouragingly, the United States and the European Union have called for an investigation into the election, and no Western leader&#x2014;aside from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2014;has recognized the results as legitimate.

(Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)To address this unprecedented election fraud, the U.S. and the EU must support an international investigative mission and clearly state that the election&#x2019;s outcome will not be recognized as legitimate until the investigation is complete. And they should emphasize that refusal to cooperate with the investigation will trigger immediate sanctions against Ivanishvili and his allies. One promising approach would be to launch an investigative mission under the EU&#x2019;s common security and defense policy. An independent investigative mission would provide essential resources and credibility, especially since Georgia&#x2019;s opposition parties and civil-society groups lack the capacity to investigate a crime of this scale on their own. The EU has an obvious stake in finding out what happened in Georgia. In today&#x2019;s era of hybrid warfare, electoral manipulation has become one of Russia&#x2019;s go-to tactics in its ongoing assault on Western democracies. These countries&#x2019; leaders should treat Georgia as an opportunity to confront an urgent security challenge to which they, too, are exposed. Meanwhile, Georgian President Salome Zourabishvili has announced that she will not exercise her constitutional authority to convene the first parliamentary session after an election, accusing Georgian Dream of &#x201C;working hand-in-hand with Russia.&#x201D; Similarly, newly elected opposition lawmakers have stated that they will boycott all parliamentary proceedings if the election results reported by the Ivanishvili-controlled CEC are not validated by international observers. Amid this growing backlash, Ivanishvili may have to convene the new parliament&#x2019;s first session with just Georgian Dream MPs in attendance. Should that happen, Georgia would effectively become a one-party state with an illegitimate government. Whether Ivanishvili is prepared to take this step remains to be seen. Nevertheless, he appears intent on following in Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s footsteps, transforming Georgia from a democracy into an authoritarian state where elections are little more than formalities. For over a decade, he has systematically undermined democratic institutions while persuading Georgians that he is a pro-Western leader, despite having made his fortune in Russia. Ivanishvili probably thought he could maintain this pro-Western fa&#xE7;ade indefinitely, but Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, and the EU&#x2019;s 2023 decision to grant Georgia candidate status, forced him to reveal his pro-Putin sympathies. Once unmasked, he recognized that his chances of winning a fair election were slim. Georgia now finds itself on the brink of a profound political transformation. If the West fails to support the country&#x2019;s opposition in challenging the election results, its 30-year-old democracy could come to an end. This outcome would derail Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession and mark a strategic defeat for Western countries. Over the past 30 years, Georgia has been the West&#x2019;s most reliable ally in the region, benefiting from substantial U.S. and EU aid aimed at helping the country modernize and build its democracy. Allowing Georgian Dream&#x2019;s electoral fraud to go unchallenged would squander decades of hard-won progress and deal a major blow to the global effort to protect democracy against authoritarian threats.

US lawmakers call for Biden to allow Poland to down Russian missiles over Ukraine	Two U.S. lawmakers have made a bipartisan appeal to President Joe Biden to allow Poland to shoot down Russian missiles over the skies of Ukraine, The Hill reported on Oct. 30. Republican Joe Wilson and Steve Cohen, the chair and ranking member respectively of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, made the call in a letter seen by the news outlet. &quot;Despite Russia&#x2019;s continued escalation through hybrid warfare &#x2014; airspace violations, attacks on critical infrastructure, and efforts to destabilize democratic institutions &#x2014; we have hesitated to confront these threats decisively, allowing Russia to wage a war against the alliance with minimal consequences,&quot; they said. &quot;In this context, Poland&#x2019;s request to intercept and neutralize missiles over Ukraine is both necessary and urgent as a support mechanism for Ukraine and a safeguard to the frontline of NATO&#x2019;s borders.&quot; The possibility of Warsaw downing Russian missiles heading toward Poland through Ukraine was laid out in June in a signed Polish-Ukrainian security agreement. While Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the time that the matter was still under discussion, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz explained that a decision by all of NATO&apos;s member states would be necessary to take this step. Then-NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg opposed the move, insisting the alliance &quot;will not be involved in this conflict.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s successor, Mark Rutte, has yet to address the topic publicly. Sikorski revisited the issue in September when he said he was in favor of shooting down Russian missiles in Poland, warning of a potential nuclear disaster He said Poland has the legal right to down stray Russian missiles and drones that enter Polish airspace. &quot;Russia can no longer...dictate to us how we defend our own country. We have both a constitution and recognized in international law to defend our airspace,&quot; Sikorski said. He warned that a Russian missile could hit a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, referencing the Chornobyl disaster of 1986 that leaked radiation across Ukraine and Belarus. A similar nuclear disaster could also impact Poland. &quot;I think we should help Ukraine to protect its nuclear power plants against such stray Russian missiles,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-call-for-biden-to-allow-poland-to-down-russian-missiles-over-ukraine/	2024-10-31T03:30:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
Global entrepreneur organization Endeavor launches first Ukraine office to boost growth amid war	The New York-based global entrepreneur network Endeavor has opened its first office in Ukraine, signaling confidence in the country&#x2019;s business potential, the organization announced on Oct. 31.Endeavor is a pool of entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors that connects its members to help develop projects and growth. The organization has over 45 offices globally which have supported 2,800 entrepreneurs, created over 4.1 million jobs, and generated annual revenues of over $67 billion, according to the network. The group said it plans to focus on high-growth tech companies that are in the scale-up phase and looking to expand globally. While key industries like metallurgy and agriculture have lost assets and land to Russian attacks and occupation since the start of the full-scale invasion, the tech sector has shown growth and remains the largest industry in terms of exports. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine&#x2019;s digital transformation minister, described the project as a &#x201C;win-win,&#x201D; saying Endeavor will receive &#x201C;smart and dedicated Ukrainians,&#x201D; in exchange for its presence in Ukraine. No matter the sector, entrepreneurs in wartime Ukraine face relentless Russian drone and missile attacks, economic instability, and acute labor shortages brought on by migration abroad and mobilization efforts that keep workers away from official employment.Sviatoslav Sviatnenko, Endeavor&#x2019;s managing director in Ukraine, said that the non-profit will help Ukrainian entrepreneurs overcome challenges including recruiting high-end talent, setting up abroad, assisting the transition from a private to a public company, and preparing for mergers and acquisitions. &#x201C;We will connect them with the right people to help them find answers to their questions and grow their businesses faster,&#x201D; said Sviatnenko. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s no longer about six or so handshakes &#x2014; it&#x2019;s just one.&#x201D;Endeavor&#x2019;s presence in Ukraine will boost support for local entrepreneurs, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF), who are both supporting the project.A board of directors consisting of well-versed Ukrainian entrepreneurs and investors like pharmaceutical company Farmak CEO Volodymyr Kostiuk and tech company Reface Co-founder Dima Shvets will back the project and bolster the entrepreneurial community, said the board&#x2019;s chair Vital Laptenok, co-founder of Ukrainian tech company Genesis and general partner at Flyer One Ventures. &#x201C;A strong economy, great leaders, and success stories &#x2014; this is exactly what we need while the country is at war with Russia,&#x201D; Laptenok said.	https://kyivindependent.com/global-entrepreneur-organization-endeavor-launches-first-ukraine-office-to-boost-growth-amid-war/	2024-10-31T03:30:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--5-.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian soldier identified by Kyiv Independent as raping woman	Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office on Oct. 31 charged Russian soldier Mykola Senenko with raping a woman in Kherson Oblast in 2022. The Kyiv Independent in June identified two Russian soldiers who were involved in the rape of two women during the occupation of Kyiv and Kherson oblasts in March 2022, one of whom was Senenko. The findings served as the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s documentary about Russian sexual violence in occupied parts of Ukraine &#x2014; He Came Back &#x2014; available in English and Ukrainian. Synenko, who was drafted from the occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, was deployed with the Russian 109th Motorized Rifle Regiment in the occupied parts of Kherson Oblast in early 2022. After interviewing the local population and officials on the spot, the Kyiv Independent found that Senenko raped a woman in Krasnivka, Kherson Oblast. The findings were passed to the prosecutor&#x2019;s office. In April, Ukraine&apos;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told the U.N. Security Council that Russia uses sexual violence as a weapon against civilians and prisoners of war. At the time, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has recorded nearly 300 cases of sexual violence committed by Russian forces since the beginning of the full-scale war. Citing testimony from people released from Russian captivity, Kyslytsya said that over 50 percent of detainees suffered torture, rape, or other forms of sexual violence. He also mentioned the Prosecutor General&apos;s documented crimes, whose victimes include 188 women, 102 men, and 15 minors. The recorded figures are likely an undercount, Kyslytsya said. &quot;Survivors cannot wait until the war is over,&quot; he said. &#xA0;&quot;They need support and justice now.&quot;Ukraine has launched a pilot program to provide emergency financial reparations to victims of sexual violence, Kyslytsya said. The program is supported by the Global Survivors Fund, which advocates for victims of conflict-related sexual assault.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-soldier-identified-by-kyiv-independent-as-raping-woman/	2024-10-31T03:11:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1244779094.jpeg
Russian court fines Google $2.5 trillion trillion trillion	A Russian court has fined Google $2.5 decillion after the U.S. tech giant allegedly blocked pro-Kremlin propaganda on YouTube, Russian state media reported on Oct. 29. An original fine of 100,000 rubles was handed to Google in 2020 which, under Russian law, has since doubled every week. Written in full $2.5 decillion is $2,500,000,000,000,000,&#x200B;000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or $2.5 trillion trillion trillion. Global GDP is only $110 trillion, or $110,000,000,000,000. Russian state media channel TASS reported that if the fine is not paid within nine months, it will begin to double every day. &quot;We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect,&quot; Google said in its quarterly results published on Oct. 29, as reported by the Independent. Google&apos;s legal problems with Russia preceded the full-scale war. The company was fined 7.2 billion rubles ($78.2 million) in December 2021 for failing to take down content that Russia has banned. Google was again fined 21.1 billion rubles ($227 million) in August 2022 and 3 million rubles ($32,000) in May 2023 for similar content related offenses. Previous appeals by Google were rejected by Russian courts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-fines-google-2-5-trillion-trillion-trillion/	2024-10-31T02:13:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-57366651.jpg
Time names Ukraine's online wedding service among best inventions of 2024	The Time magazine chose the Ukrainian Diia app&#x2019;s online marriage service to be one of the best inventions of 2024, its website reported on Oct. 30. For more than two decades, Time editors have annually spotlighted the most influential new products and ideas in their Best Inventions issue. Dubbed &quot;the country in the smartphone,&quot; the Diia mobile app was launched by the Digital Transformation Ministry in 2020. As of early August, it included some 130 services and is used by more than 20 million Ukrainians, according to officials. Ukrainians can apply, propose, and get married online by choosing a place and date. The couple can be in the same place or hundreds of kilometers apart. Ukraine became the first country to have such a practice fully digitalized. Since the start of the full-scale war, nearly a million people have been defending the country. Through the app, soldiers can now get married while on the front line. According to the Digital Transformation Ministry, as of Sept. 20, 251 couples had gotten married in Diia, and 3,200 had applied for marriage online. Almost 830,000 proposals were recorded, with 106,000 people saying &quot;yes.&quot; Apart from marrying online, the app allows users to access various official documents, including their passports, driver&apos;s licenses, or vehicle registrations. It also allows users to register a business or pay taxes with a few clicks.	https://kyivindependent.com/time-names-ukraines-online-wedding-service-among-best-inventions-of-2024/	2024-10-31T00:59:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2152964421.jpg
Ukraine's UN envoy names North Korean generals sent to aid Russia's war	The Ukrainian ambassador to the U.N., Sergiy Kyslytsya, provided the names of the three generals North Korea had sent to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30. Ukraine previously revealed that Russia is preparing to deploy a 12,000-strong contingent of North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals. The top officers include two deputy chiefs of the North Korean General Staff: Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, who oversees special forces, and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, who is in charge of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s intelligence agency, Kyslytsya said. The third general is Major General Sin Kum Cheol, the head of the Main Operational Directorate, according to the Ukrainian envoy. Kim, who is believed to serve as the representative of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Russia, commands the XI Corps special forces, which Seoul believes had been sent to aid Moscow&apos;s war. Ri, the chief of the spy agency, has been sanctioned by South Korea over his involvement in a number of cyber attacks, Reuters reported. Moscow plans to form at least five 2,000-3,000-strong units manned by North Korean troops, Kyslytsya said. They would equipped with Russian uniforms and arms and integrated into formations with ethnic minorities from Russia&apos;s Far East regions to conceal their presence. NATO and the Pentagon said that some North Korean forces have already arrived in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in August. Kyslytsya estimated the number of North Korean troops already stationed in Kursk Oblast to be 400. &quot;According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine,&quot; Kyslytsya said at a meeting called to discuss the dispatch of Pyongyang&apos;s forces. Kyiv expects North Korean troops to join the fight against Ukraine in November. Speaking at the meeting, Russian envoy Vasily Nebenzya denied the transfer and called it a &quot;bare-faced lie&quot; despite mounting evidence of the contrary. Russia and North Korea initially refuted the reports but later took a more evasive stance, saying such a step would be within their right but stopping short of openly confirming it. Moscow and Pyongyang have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both countries denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-names-north-korean-generals/	2024-10-31T00:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147865497.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 694,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 694,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 31. This number includes 1,310 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,156 tanks, 18,450 armored fighting vehicles, 27,961 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,013 artillery systems, 1,243 multiple launch rocket systems, 994 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,063 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-694-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-30T23:31:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163893306.jpg
Georgia's president declines to appear before prosecutors in election fraud investigation	Georgia&#x2019;s Prosecutor&apos;s Office announced on Oct. 30 it had launched an investigation into alleged vote rigging in the recent parliamentary elections. President Salome Zourabichvili, who was summoned for questioning as part of the probe, has refused to appear at the Prosecutor&apos;s Office. The Prosecution Service of Georgia announced on Oct. 30 it would carry out all necessary investigative and procedural steps to examine the issues highlighted by the Central Election Commission, the president, various political parties, and election observation groups. In response to the allegations, the Election Commission said it would recount votes at several randomly selected polling stations. During a press conference in Tbilisi, President Zourabichvili presented footage purportedly showing ballot violations. &quot;It is not the President&apos;s responsibility to provide evidence that already exists within society,&quot; she said, adding that that non-governmental organizations, observers, and citizens have consistently provided substantial evidence, revealing extensive and systematic election rigging. The investigation followed the opposition&#x2019;s denunciation of the parliamentary elections as illegitimate. The ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory with 54% of the votes, despite protests from the pro-Western opposition, which described the election as a &quot;constitutional coup.&quot; President Zourabichvili also noted that her summons to the prosecutor&#x2019;s office suspiciously coincided with recent remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, former President of Russia and current Deputy Chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council. Medvedev had previously called for Zourabichvili&#x2019;s &quot;removal from office and arrest.&quot; The European Union expressed concerns about &quot;irregularities&quot; observed during the voting process and suspended Georgia&apos;s EU accession process as of Oct. 30. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was &quot;deeply alarmed&quot; by democratic backsliding in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-president-declines-to-appear-before-prosecutors-in-election-fraud-investigation/	2024-10-30T22:47:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180878552.jpg
Ukraine produces 20 Bohdana howitzers per month, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine is now producing nearly 20 Bohdana self-propelled artillery units monthly. In a video address on Oct. 30 following his visit to the Ukraine-Nordic Summit, Zelensky highlighted the success of the &quot;Danish model,&quot; a partnership that enables Ukraine to secure funding from allies specifically for its defense production. &quot;...The Danish model allows (us) to attract finance from our partners in Ukrainian defense production. For example, we&#x2019;re now manufacturing almost 20 &apos;Bohdana&apos; artillery units monthly, with strong progress across other areas,&quot; Zelensky explained. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. &quot;And there&#x2019;s more to come: shells, equipment, drones &#x2013; everything we need. My gratitude goes out to everyone assisting us,&quot; the president added. The 2S22 Bohdana is a truck-mounted self-propelled howitzer with a 42-kilometer firing range. Its &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; capability provides a significant advantage over towed artillery. Unlike towed guns, which are vulnerable to enemy detection after firing and require time-consuming relocation, the Bohdana can quickly move after firing, enhancing its survivability on the battlefield.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produces-20-bohdana-howitzers-per-month-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T21:48:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-16_48_24.png
Ukraine could join Union by late 2029, EU official says	Ukraine could join the European Union by 2029 if it completes the necessary reforms, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said on Oct. 29. To advance this goal, the EU has introduced specific initiatives, such as the &quot;Growth Plan&quot; and the &quot;Ukraine Plan,&quot; aimed at accelerating reform processes in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans. Ukraine submitted its plan on March 20, detailing its vision for reconstruction, modernization, and reforms essential to its EU accession journey. Ukraine has made significant strides toward EU membership since applying in February 2022, and receiving candidate status by June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, marking a pivotal advancement in its integration efforts. The European Commission has recently praised Ukraine&#x2019;s progress on critical reforms, including those related to the rule of law, judicial system, and anti-corruption measures, though it emphasizes that further reforms are still required. &#x201C;With the Growth Plan, we have made it possible for the Western Balkans, for Moldova, but also for Ukraine [with the Ukraine Facility], to complete the reforms and to have everything ready and to become a member by the end of the next mandate (of the European Commission),&#x201D; Varhelyi noted. In June, President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed confidence that Ukraine would achieve full membership in the European Union. The first intergovernmental conference on Ukraine&apos;s EU accession took place in Luxembourg on June 25, officially launching accession negotiations between Ukraine and the European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-could-join-union-by-late-2029-eu-official-says/	2024-10-30T19:18:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156213730.jpg
Sanctioned LNG ships gather off Russian coast as buyers withdraw, Bloomberg reports	Tankers bearing sanctioned Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) have clustered together off Russia&apos;s eastern coast, indicating that Moscow is struggling to sell the product amid Western restrictions, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 30. Days before, commerical liquefication at Russia&apos;s Arctic LNG 2 came to a halt due to shipping difficulties imposed by Western sanctions. Three of the tankers now anchored near Russia previously loaded cargo from the Arctic LNG 2 facility. The vessels &#x2014;&#xA0;Nova Energy, Pioneer, and Asya Energy &#x2014;&#xA0;are docked near the port of Nakhodka, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. All three tankers have been sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, was envisaged as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a flagship project that would help the country become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer. It aimed to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year. Russia intended to sell Arctic LNG 2 products primarily to Asian markets, but companies from China and Japan suspended participation in the project last December due to international sanctions. The government of India also announced in September 2024 that it would not buy LNG produced at the Arctic LNG 2 facility. While the plant began shipping cargoes in August, Russia has reportedly not been able to find a buyer for its products. The U.S. on Oct. 30 announced new sanctions on a company that transported equipment for the Arctic LNG 2 project and a network of shipping companies from the UAE and Singapore involved in the purchase of LNG transportation vessels for Novatek. The latest round of restrictions came after the U.S. on Oct. 22 said it would &quot;tighten the screws&quot; on the export of Russian LNG, depriving Moscow of energy revenues that fund the full-scale war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctioned-lng-ships-gather-off-russian-coast-as-buyers-withdraw-bloomberg-reports/	2024-10-30T17:43:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134814.jpg
Parts of Pokrovsk will be blocked for city's defense, authorities say	Parts of the city of Pokrovsk will be blocked off due to defense preparations, Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk military administration, told Suspilne on Oct. 30. The embattled front-line city of Pokrovsk has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in the Donetsk sector in recent months. The city is a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. &quot;Fortifications are being built in Pokrovsk, and we are already entering the city, and certain areas of the city will be blocked, so please leave these areas, not entering or leaving the city,&quot; Dobriak said. &quot;Several echelons have already been built in the city, which will partially block the streets and neighborhoods of Pokrovsk.&quot; Entry and exit to the city will not be entirely blocked, Dobriak said, clarifying earlier remarks on national television. Dobriak&apos;s announcement follows reports that Russia has captured the nearby town of Selydove. While Ukraine has not officially confirmed the claims, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; The loss of Selydove is dire news for Pokrovsk, which lies only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, gaining territory despite mounting losses. Much of the city infrastructure has already been destroyed, Dobriak said. &quot;The infrastructure is 80% destroyed. Power supply is available in 60% of Pokrovsk, it is absent in six settlements and the town of Rodynske,&quot; he said. &quot;The wounded are taken to Dobropillia, we have family doctors and a city hospital. There are 325 wells in the city, including 9 points of free drinking water. The utility company also delivers water, and UNICEF has been helping to deliver water for two weeks.&quot; According to Dobriak, 11,900 people, including 55 children, remain in Pokrovsk as of Oct. 30. Evacuations are ongoing. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Pokrovsk had a population of around 60,000.	https://kyivindependent.com/parts-of-pokrovsk-will-be-blocked-for-citys-defense-authorities-say/	2024-10-30T16:39:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179808433.jpg
Russian attack on Kharkiv kills child, injures at least 29	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening on Oct. 30, killing a child and injuring at least 29 people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. According to preliminary data, the attack was carried out with a high-explosive FAB-500 bomb, Syniehubov said. A child was killed, and 29 people were injured. The attack hit a 9-story building, destroying the entryway from the first through fifth floors, the State Emergency Service reported. Fires are being extinguished in several apartments and rescuers are searching for more victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. Several injured people, including a child, have already been pulled from the debris, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks for over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial strikes, often targeting densely populated neighborhoods. A Russian bombing on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark which has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. An overnight attack just hours later killed four people and destroyed several homes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kharkiv-injures-23-including-child/	2024-10-30T15:47:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kharkiv1.jpg
Putin will not prevail in Ukraine,' even with North Korean help, US defense secretary says	North Korean troops outfitted with Russian uniforms and equipment are making their way to the Russia-Ukraine border, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Oct. 30 during a joint press conference with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun. North Korea has sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine, though estimates vary as to the number of troops. The Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 that 3,000 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast were housed only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. &quot;The evidence now suggests the that North Korea has sent about 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia,&quot; Austin said at the Pentagon briefing. &quot;And some of these DPRK troops have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are seeing them outfitted with Russian uniforms and provided with Russian equipment.&quot; Austin said he would not speculate as to when the North Korean units would begin to engage in direct combat alongside Russian soldiers, but said that the U.S. was working with international partners to &quot;discourage Russia from employing these troops in combat.&quot; The deployment of North Korean troops is a direct result of Russia&apos;s heavy battle losses, Austin added. An allliance with North Korea highlights &quot;how much trouble&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin is in. &quot;Putin will not prevail in Ukraine, even with more help from North Korea.&quot; South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun condemned North Korea&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war, calling such action a &quot;war crime&quot; and demanding the &quot;immediate withdrawal&quot; of North Korean troops. &#xA0; &quot;The deployment is (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un&apos;s attempt to maintain its dictatorship, and Kim Jong Un didn&apos;t hesitate to sell out its young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,&quot; he said. Kim also discussed the role a South Korean monitoring delegation would play, following President Yoon Suk Yeol&apos;s announcement on Oct. 28 that Seoul would send observers to Ukraine in the coming days. &quot;I believe it could serve as a great opportunity for our analysis team or observers to learn the movements or trends of the North Korean troops,&quot; Kim said. Information gathered on North Korea&apos;s weapons systems and tactics would be useful to the future security of South Korea, Kim said. &quot;If we don&apos;t send our observers or analysis teams, it would mean we are not faithfully doing our jobs,&quot; he said. Moscow and Pyongyang&apos;s &quot;unlawful military cooperation&quot; represents an escalation in the war, Austin said, and there will be &quot;consequences&quot; to their escalating aggression. The U.S. is considering &quot;different kinds of action,&quot; but Austin declined to provide details or examples.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-will-not-prevail-in-ukraine-even-with-north-korean-help-us-defense-secretary-says/	2024-10-30T15:12:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181250913.jpg
Can Harris sway Pennsylvania’s Ukrainian vote ahead of a tight presidential race?	JENKINTOWN, Pennsylvania &#x2014; Ukrainian American Sophika Lashchyk-Tytla says she can&#x2019;t understand why her brother plans to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump given his open hostility to continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Hours after unconvincing arguments with her brother, the Philadelphia native carried a kit of campaign information as she canvassed in the city&#x2019;s suburbs with fellow Ukrainians who&#x2019;ve rallied around Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Just ten days before the election, nearly a dozen went door-knocking in Montgomery County, where one of the country&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian populations now has voter material available in Ukrainian for the first time. The county includes non-voting recent emigres from President Joe Biden&#x2019;s post-full-scale invasion Uniting for Ukraine parole program and thousands more with U.S. citizenship who arrived in the 1990s. The door-to-door canvassing in the campaign&apos;s final days unfolded amid immense stakes for Ukraine&#x2019;s more than two-and-a-half-year fight against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Pennsylvania is the swing state all paths to the White House seem to run through for both candidates. &#x201C;I feel like I&#x2019;m trying to save Ukraine and our country and I can&#x2019;t listen to your (Trump) stuff,&#x201D; Lashchyk-Tytla told her brother as she departed for a weekend of rallying Ukrainian support for Harris. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s thinking (about) Ukraine, the Ukrainians that are voting for (Trump) have been listening to his double-speak, and more recently, he&#x2019;s been really clear that he&#x2019;s not supportive of Ukraine, so how can you say that &#x2018;Trump is going to help Ukraine&#x2019; and say he is the only one who keeps (Russia) on their toes?&#x201D; Sophika Lashchyk-Tytla, a Ukrainian American from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, joined the Harris campaign as a volunteer to door-knock in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Harris&#x2019;s team knows securing Montgomery County could lead to capturing the entire state demands support from Pennsylvania&#x2019;s large Eastern European population. Their numbers exceed the crucial margin of victory, with Biden winning by nearly 81,000 votes in the state in 2020 to prevent Trump&#x2019;s re-election to a second term. The Harris campaign hopes that by going to traditionally conservative Ukrainian communities in Pennsylvania and reminding them of Trump&#x2019;s adversarial position to supporting Ukraine in its defense of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, the state&#x2019;s Polish and Lithuanian populations will also show up for Harris alongside their Ukrainian neighbors. Andrew Lashchyk, Spohika&#x2019;s 57-year-old brother, says he&#x2019;s sent thousands of dollars to support Ukraine. He simultaneously wants a better U.S. economy and for Ukraine to not cede any of its land to Russia, which is why he&#x2019;ll vote for Trump. The war will end sooner under a Trump administration, he says. &#x201C;In terms of what Trump will do for Ukraine, it&#x2019;s kind of up in the air, I don&apos;t believe he will necessarily provide weapons and help so to speak, but what he will do is pressure (Russian President Vladimir Putin),&#x201D; Lashchyk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I believe that Trump will negotiate some kind of end to the war, do I believe Ukraine will have to cede some of our ground in order for the killing to stop, probably, I&#x2019;m totally not okay with that but I have no choice.&#x201D; For Lashchyk, who considers himself extremely patriotic for Ukraine and America, Harris hasn&#x2019;t offered enough commitment to Ukraine in her campaign. &#x201C;If (Harris) somehow was able to guarantee me another $30 billion that would be sent (to Ukraine) the day she won office, okay I might give up my American country for Ukraine.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine is one of the candidates&#x2019; most vividly contentious issues of the Nov. 5 election, with their respective positions in near complete opposition to each other. &#x201C;Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda will not only raise costs for Ukrainian-American families and strip them of their fundamental freedoms, it will also put the people of Ukraine in grave danger as he sidles up to Putin, threatens to cut off support for Ukraine, and abandons our allies,&#x201D; Filip Jotevski, the Harris campaign&#x2019;s national director of diaspora and ethnic engagement, wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. After appearing alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in September, Harris offered a glimpse into her stance on her support for Ukraine, saying in an October interview that Ukraine&#x2019;s hope to join NATO is a question for the future but that she would not meet with Putin for peace talks without Ukraine&#x2019;s presence. In a highly anticipated Oct. 29 speech on the National Mall in the shadow of the White House, she added that Putin and North Korea are cheering for Trump to win. Trump, who has a history of cozying up to Putin, has pledged &#x2014; with minimal detail &#x2014; to swiftly end the war and even blamed Zelensky for stoking Moscow&#x2019;s invasion of his country. The vast divide between the two candidates&apos; positions on Ukraine is visible in the campaign&apos;s final days. While both candidates are focused on Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Latino and Black voters, Trump&#x2019;s attention to the full-scale war and large voting diaspora are at a minimum. For Harris, her surrogates are ramping up outreach to Americans of Ukrainian roots in crucial swing states. After hiring Jotevski to lead national diaspora efforts in September and placing him in Pennsylvania for the race&#x2019;s final stretch, Harris&#x2019;s campaign is rallying Americans with Ukrainian roots to door-knock in Philadelphia&#x2019;s suburbs. Nearly half of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian diaspora of between 100,000 and 200,000 reside in that area. &#x201C;While Donald Trump cozies up to dictators like Putin and idolizes fascists like Hitler, Vice President Kamala Harris will never waver in her defense of America&#x2019;s security and ideals or the people of Ukraine,&#x201D; Jotevski said. But Harris-canvassing Ukrainians are disappointed by the diaspora&apos;s small but passionate turnout for the Democratic nominee, citing concerns that many in their community are quietly voting for Trump over domestic issues like the economy. &#x201C;Maybe 30-40% (of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian community) is for Harris, and the (rest), the majority is still for Trump,&#x201D; said Marta Fedoriw, a prominent figure in the region&#x2019;s Ukrainian diaspora community. Marta Fedoriw, a Ukrainian living in rural Pennsylvania, at the rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, on Oct. 26, 2024. Fedoriw says she&#x2019;s voting for Harris because she liked the vice president&#x2019;s words when said she&#x2019;ll stand with Kyiv until Ukraine prevails. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We know that Ukrainian Americans were very Republican years ago, because of the Republican Party, (President Dwight D.) Eisenhower, (Ronald) Reagan, strong anti-Soviet Union (feelings), but since these last few elections they&#x2019;ve turned the Ukrainian vote (silent), they&#x2019;re still voting for Trump but they don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201D; Fedoriw, who is the chair of the Return Ukraine&#x2019;s Children initiative at the Ukrainian National Women&#x2019;s League of America, &#x200B;&#x200B;has been rallying across Pennsylvania for the Ukrainian community to vote for Harris, including at an Oct. 26 event co-sponsored by the Harris campaign. She says it&#x2019;s not that clear why so many in the state&#x2019;s diaspora plan to vote for Trump. She hears Ukrainians say things like, &#x2018;Trump is a businessman, we need a tough guy to deal with Putin,&#x2019; and &#x2018;What has Biden done for Ukraine, he&#x2019;s been slowly doling out support.&#x2019; &#xA0; Both Trump and Harris-supporting Ukrainians in Pennsylvania who spoke with the Kyiv Independent are frustrated by the Biden Administration&#x2019;s slow drip of aid to Ukraine that has at times been delayed and repeated contradictions of previously stated red lines, such as the delivery of Western fighter jets. &#xA0; Because of what she hears, Fedoriw knows the Harris campaign&#x2019;s targeting of Eastern Europeans is needed, especially to reach the state&#x2019;s 700,000 Polish Americans. Despite widely shared fears in the state&#x2019;s Polish community that Putin&#x2019;s sights are set beyond Ukraine, Fedoriw says the population&#x2019;s ties to the Roman Catholic Church are so deep that Harris&#x2019;s stance on abortion rights is pushing many toward Trump. Others disagree, such as Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Polish American community leaders, who endorsed Harris after she gave the community recognition in the campaign&#x2019;s only Harris-Trump debate. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you (Trump) tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up (Ukraine,&#x201D; Harris said in the debate. After the Harris campaign sponsored an event to get Ukrainians in Pennsylvania out to vote, a handful of the diaspora went door-knocking in a predominantly working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)But no diaspora community is a monolith. The Harris campaign hosted a Polish American bus tour across Pennsylvania two weeks out from the election and took nearly a dozen Ukrainians canvassing on Oct. 26 after a rally to reach Ukrainian voters. Speakers at the event included Victoria Nuland, the former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, and Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine-born former director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council. Two days later, the former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger and other Harris surrogates told Scranton, Pennsylvania voters that a vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz is a vote for the continued support of NATO and Ukraine. However, some of the few dozen passionate Ukrainians at the rally reserved feelings of fear that the Harris campaign&#x2019;s efforts aren&#x2019;t reaching swayable Ukrainians and may even be too little too late. Fedoriw said the huge voting block has pockets of Ukrainian voters who still associate Democrats with communism and, despite their hopes for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty, can&#x2019;t come around on voting for Harris. &#x201C;That really hit me, how few people were at the rally,&#x201D; Lashchyk-Tytla, the Ukrainian from Philadelphia&#x2019;s suburbs, said. &#x201C;The turnout was horrible (given) the amount of Ukrainians we have here.&#x201D; The chair of the Montgomery County&#x2019;s Board of Elections, Neil Makhija, sat for a town hall in the center of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The Trump campaign is equally spending the final stretch in Pennsylvania but is more focused on reaching Black voters and relaying messages about &#x201C;election integrity&#x201D; than allocating resources to door-knocking. If the Trump campaign is doing outreach to Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Eastern Europeans, the message isn&#x2019;t reaching Ukrainians around Philadelphia, according to multiple leaders in the Ukrainian community who spoke with the Kyiv Independent in the campaign&#x2019;s final days. The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment on their approach to reaching diaspora communities. Just north of Philadelphia in Jenkintown, the heart of the Ukrainian community, attendees of the last Sunday service of October at the St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church spilled into a dining hall for a nonpartisan town hall on the significance of the election for Ukraine. The county&#x2019;s Board of Elections Commissioner, Neil Makhija, who broadened the language accessibility of voter material, took questions from the nearly two dozen attendees. &#x201C;This is an existential issue for Ukrainian American communities, they understand the contrast has never been more clear between the presidential candidates,&#x201D; Makhija told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s one who would essentially let Ukraine disappear and another who is backing the existence of the country.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/can-harris-sway-pennsylvanias-ukrainian-vote-ahead-of-tight-race/	2024-10-30T14:18:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_0314.JPG
Ukraine war latest: North Korean soldiers reportedly 50 km from Ukraine's border	Key developments on Oct. 30: Around 3,000 North Korean troops who arrived in Kursk Oblast were housed in barracks only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed Ukrainian intelligence officials. A few hundred of those are special forces, with the rest being regular troops, one source said. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. Recent reports suggest that a small number may already be in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, while Ukraine put the total number at 12,000. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as a main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Oct. 29 that Kyiv should strike back at North Korean troops &quot;if they go into Ukraine.&quot; A Pentagon spokesman added at a separate briefing that Moscow&apos;s recourse to North Korean troops reflects a &quot;dire situation&quot; of its manpower. &quot;I am concerned about it, yes,&quot; Biden answered to a question regarding their arrival, adding that Ukraine should strike back if the troops enter into Ukrainian territory, but did not elaborate further. In a separate news briefing on Oct. 28, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said a &quot;relatively small number&quot; of North Korean troops are already in Kursk Oblast, echoing recent comments by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said thousands more troops are expected to head there in the coming weeks. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. Ukraine&apos;s request for Tomahawk missiles was &quot;confidential information&quot; between partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky complained on Oct. 30 after a leak in the U.S. media. The New York Times reported on Oct. 29 that, according to undisclosed U.S. officials, the request for Tomahawk missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) was part of the secretive &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; included in Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. The sources told the outlet that Washington was unconvinced that Ukraine needed the weaponry and was reluctant to supply them due to their limited numbers. &quot;It was confidential information between Ukraine and the White House. How to understand these messages?&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing with journalists from Nordic countries. &quot;So this means (that) between partners, there is no (confidentiality).&quot; According to Zelensky, Ukraine requested the missiles on the condition that it would deploy them only if Russia refused to end its war and de-escalate. &quot;I said that this is a preventive method. I was told that it is an escalation,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv has been trying to secure additional assistance from U.S. President Joe Biden before he leaves office in January. There are fears that Washington might scale down its support if Republican nominee Donald Trump wins the election on Nov. 5. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky pitched the five-step victory plan, containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan were met with a lukewarm response from partners, with the White House still refusing to permit long-range strikes on Russian territory and several countries resisting a NATO invitation for Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 30 denied alleged talks with Ukraine about mutually halting strikes on energy infrastructure, the Russian state news agency TASS reported. The denial comes after the Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia are planning to resume discussions about halting the strikes on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure after the talks abruptly ended in August following Ukraine&apos;s Kursk incursion. &quot;There is a lot of fake news now that has no connection to reality,&quot; Peskov told the media, referring to the Financial Times story. According to a senior Ukrainian official, Moscow and Kyiv have already reduced the frequency of attacks on energy infrastructure in recent weeks as part of an agreement reached by their intelligence services, Ukrainian news outlet New Voice reported on Oct. 30. An agreement would mark the most significant de-escalation of the war since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21 that a willingness on Russia&apos;s part to halt the strikes might signal a willingness to start broader peace talks. Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter yet, with half of its energy infrastructure in ruins after Russia launched massive campaigns against the country&apos;s energy grid in the autumn-winter period of 2023-2023 and again in the spring of 2024. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. South Korea is currently not considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean official. Seoul has not received such a request from the Ukrainian side, and the matter is not under consideration, the source told the South Korean news agency amid speculations of South Korea&apos;s shifting stance on the issue. South Korea has not provided direct lethal support to Kyiv as its legislation prohibits supplying arms to a warzone, though unconfirmed reports suggested Ukraine has obtained South Korean shells indirectly via the U.S. The country&apos;s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said South Korea might revise its stance in the light of deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea, namely in regards to the dispatch of North Korean troops to join the war. A South Korean delegation is expected to visit Ukraine this week to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. Kyiv also plans to send a special envoy to South Korea, and the two countries will discuss the topic this week, Yonhap reported. &quot;It will take a day or two for the Ukrainian side to designate a special envoy and finalize a plan to visit and hold discussions here,&quot; the official told the news agency. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea. Russia is also believed to be preparing the deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops, with at least some of them in combat roles. A small number of North Korean soldiers have already arrived in Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing Western intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-soldiers-50-km-from-ukraines-border-including-special-forces/	2024-10-30T14:08:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
UK promises $3.8 billion per year in military aid to Ukraine	The U.K. will allocate three billion pounds ($3.8 billion) per year to military support for Ukraine, according to the draft budget submitted to the parliament on Oct. 30. The proposed budget, which includes some tax increases and slashed expenditures, will increase the national defense budget and maintain the U.K.&apos;s previous commitments to Ukraine&apos;s military support. &quot;Today, I am announcing a total increase to the Ministry of Defense&apos;s Budget of &#xA3;2.9 billion next year, ensuring the U.K. comfortably exceeds our NATO commitments and providing guaranteed military support to Ukraine of &#xA3;3 billion per year, for as long as it takes,&quot; U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced on Oct. 30. The funds are in addition to a &#xA3;2.26 billion ($2.9 billion) loan, backed by frozen Russian assets, that the U.K. government announced last week. The U.K.&apos;s Labor party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, came to power in July following a resounding electoral victory. The draft budget aims to tackle &quot;a decade and a half&quot; of stagnation along with high national debt. Despite these financial challenges, the Labor budget does not propose any cuts to Ukraine&apos;s military aid and builds on the previous government&apos;s promises. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged last May to send Ukraine &#xA3;3 billion per year for &quot;as long as is necessary.&quot; The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine, alongside the U.S. and Germany. The country has pledgedover $9 billion in military assistance since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-promises-3-8-billion-per-year-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2024-10-30T14:02:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181900819.jpg
Georgia's accession to EU has been suspended due to actions of Georgian government	The process of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union has been suspended due to the actions of the Georgian government since the spring of 2024, the European Commission announced on Oct. 30. The decision comes after the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party won a majority in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections. Pro-EU parties have disputed the result, and European monitors also said the elections were characterized by intimidation and irregularities. Although Georgia received EU candidate status last December, the accession process has been &quot;de facto halted due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government since Spring 2024,&quot; &#xA0;the European Commission&apos;s statement read. A joint International Election Observation Mission led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) identified &quot;several shortcomings that occurred in a tense and highly polarized environment.&quot; Among the shortcomings, the European Commission singled out the recent legislative amendments to the election process, frequent compromises on vote secrecy, procedural inconsistencies, intimidation, and pressure on voters that negatively impacted public trust in the process. The European Commission also insisted on the need for comprehensive electoral reform, which has already been mentioned in the body&apos;s previous key recommendations. Pawel Herczynski, the Ambassador of the European Union to Georgia, also confirmed the suspension of the country&apos;s accession to the European Union. &quot;Due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government, EU leaders stopped Georgia&apos;s accession process. It remains on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU, our values, and our principles,&quot; Herczynski said. Herczynski said that the Georgian authorities have not demonstrated &quot;sufficient political will&quot; to implement the necessary reforms on the path to EU membership. Referring to the latest EU Enlargement Report, the ambassador mentioned that Georgia has lagged behind in steps related to combating disinformation, political polarization, elections, and human rights. There has also been a setback in the judicial system, which Herczynski called &quot;unprecedented&quot; for an EU candidate country. &quot;What&apos;s next? The future of EU-Georgia relations is now in the hands of the Georgian leaders,&quot; he said. The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow while curbing its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year sparked mass demonstrations and led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting numerous violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite the opposition&apos;s protests.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-accession-to-eu-has-been-suspended-due-to-actions-of-georgian-government/	2024-10-30T13:15:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180419095.jpg
EU slams Ukraine's wartime pool of TV channels, urges Kyiv to restore media pluralism	The European Commission has criticized the telethon, Ukraine&apos;s state-run pool of TV channels created during wartime, and urged Kyiv to restore a &quot;pluralistic media landscape,&quot; according to an updated report on progress made by EU candidate countries published on Oct. 30. The so-called telethon, branded as &quot;Yedyni Novyny&quot; (&quot;United News&quot;), was launched at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. It was created by merging the coverage of Ukraine&apos;s biggest TV channels. The telethon was initially seen as a legitimate response to Russia&apos;s aggression, but later, it was accused of monopolizing television coverage and stifling dissent. Some opposition television channels have complained that they were excluded from the telethon due to their political stance. Brussels expects Ukraine to restore the work of all broadcasters in the pre-war format, questioning the telethon&apos;s objectivity. One of the European Commission&apos;s criticisms concerns the financing of the telethon from the state budget. The European Commission also commented on the Rada TV channel, emphasizing that the media should cover the work of the entire parliament, including the opposition. Despite concerns about the functioning of the media in Ukraine, the European Commission said it is ready to open the first negotiation clusters, starting with fundamentals, with Ukraine in 2025. &quot;The opening of accession negotiations with Ukraine has been an important recognition of Ukraine&apos;s determination to pursue reforms on the path of European Union accession,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Following the first intergovernmental conference in June 2024, the analytical examination of the acquis (the screening) is progressing smoothly.&quot; Ukraine received EU candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova in November 2023, and the European Council approved the decision a month later. The commission then presented the negotiation framework. The first intergovernmental conference on Ukraine&apos;s accession was held in Luxembourg in June, marking the official beginning of accession negotiations between the European Union and Ukraine. However, Ukraine&apos;s entry into the EU most likely remains years away. Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said that Kyiv could join the bloc in 2030.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-commission-criticizes-state-sponsored-telethon-calls-for-restoration-of-pluralistic-media-landscape-in-ukraine/	2024-10-30T13:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Next Ramstein meeting to take place in 'coming weeks,' Zelensky says	The next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein format, will be held in the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 30. Prior to Zelensky&apos;s announcement, the White House said on Oct. 17 that the next meeting in the Ramstein format would be held online in November virtually but did not disclose the exact date of the event. U.S. President Joe Biden was initially supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12 but postponed it due to Hurricane Milton in the U.S. &quot;It is very important that each support package is fully implemented, and that our actions with our partners are truly coordinated and as effective as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming virtual Ramstein meeting will be the first one held at the leader-level. During the last one, Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. At the initially planned Ramstein meeting, Zelensky was set to present his five-point victory plan to allies, although he met with leaders individually following the summit&apos;s postponement.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-meeting-to-take-place-in-coming-weeks-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T11:57:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
US imposes sanctions on nearly 400 individuals, legal entities, including Putin's relative	The U.S. imposed sanctions on Oct. 30 against nearly 400 entities and individuals directly or indirectly involved in supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department announced. The U.S. and its allies regularly introduce new restrictions on entities and individuals that fuel Russia&apos;s aggression in Ukraine and help Russia circumvent sanctions. The recent limitations are applied to companies involved in sanctions evasion networks in 17 jurisdictions, including China, India, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Thailand, and Turkey, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. Treasury Department added about 40 foreign companies to the sanctions list and expanded controls over nearly 50 other organizations to limit the illegal flow of &quot;sensitive dual-use goods&quot; to Russia. The export of precursors to Russia and Belarus was also restricted in order to prevent the production of components that could be used on the battlefield. The sanctions were imposed on a company that transported equipment for the Russian Arctic LNG 2 project and a network of shipping companies from the UAE and Singapore involved in the purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transportation vessels for Russia&apos;s Novatek company. Besides, three subsidiaries of Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy company, were sanctioned as well. &quot;The U.S. and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,&quot; said Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. The U.S. Treasury Department also sanctioned Russian Deputy Defense Ministers Pavel Fradkov, Andrei Bulyga, Alexander Fomin, and Viktor Goremykin. Fomin was appointed deputy defense minister in early 2017, Goremykin in July 2022, Bulyga in March 2024, and Fradkov in June, already after Andrei Belousov became the new head of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. In addition, the U.S. sanctions list includes Anna Tsivileva, the great-niece of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under European Union sanctions since 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-on-nearly-400-individuals-legal-entities-including-putins-relative/	2024-10-30T10:52:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154932665.jpg
Ukraine presents roadmap for partially opening airspace during war	The Communities and Territories Development Ministry presented in Warsaw a roadmap for partially opening Ukraine&apos;s airspace, which has been closed throughout the full-scale invasion, according to a statement by the ministry published on Oct. 30. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine&apos;s airspace has been closed to all flights due to the risk of Russian attacks. The Ukrainian government has nonetheless looked for ways to restore the industry during the war. Deputy Communities and Territories Development Minister Serhii Derkach introduced a step-by-step plan for a partial reopening of the airspace at a conference in Warsaw. Risk assessments for civil aviation, peculiarities of ensuring air navigation safety, Ukraine&apos;s airports&apos; readiness to resume operations, and mechanisms for coordinating civil and military aviation were also discussed. The ministry did not say which airports would open under the plan. The Kyiv Independent earlier reported in March that three airports were rumored to be in consideration if, and when, the country is able to open its airspace during the war: the western Lviv and Uzhhorod airports and Kyiv&#x2019;s Boryspil airport. Besides the ministry, the roadmap was developed with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, the State Aviation Service, the State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services (Uksatse), the Air Force Command, and the heads of Ukrainian international airports, including Boryspil and Lviv. &quot;This is the first expert discussion that we expect will help us move forward in creating the conditions for opening the airspace. During the war, our strategic objective is to preserve aviation infrastructure and qualified personnel so that when the time comes, we can resume civilian flights as quickly as possible,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the communities and territories development minister. Mary Elizabeth Madden, economic counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, emphasized the importance of supporting Ukraine in its efforts to restore civil aviation and the willingness of the U.S. to provide expert and technical assistance. International airlines, including LOT Polish Airlines, SkyUp Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, and others, also joined the discussion on opening airspace in Ukraine during martial law. On April 11, 2023, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) published a seven-year forecast that included the likelihood of restrictions over Ukrainian airspace remaining in place until 2029. The State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services said in 2023 that Ukrainian airspace &quot;will reopen after the war ends.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-presents-roadmap-for-opening-airspace-during-martial-law/	2024-10-30T09:26:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1238442755.jpg

Ukraine never wanted to seize Kursk nuclear Power Plant, Zelensky says	Ukrainian forces never intended to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast following Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the region in early August, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during an interview with Nordic media on Oct. 30. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacking or planning to attack the plant since the start of the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine has flatly denied. &quot;Russia thinks they are very strong, but if we wanted to seize their nuclear power plant (Kursk Nuclear Power Plant), we would have done it, we could have done it, but we never wanted to do it. Because we understand that it would mean becoming the same as Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We are not occupying their critical infrastructure, as they did with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.&quot; The plant lies roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Ukrainian-held positions in Kursk Oblast, according to the DeepState monitoring site. The purpose of the Kursk operation was to create a buffer zone to protect the Ukrainian border, the president added. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but has recently faced mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10. North Korean troops may join the Russian military in this front-line area soon, as confirmed by NATO and the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military said that they had recorded North Korean troops in the area but did not engage them in combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-never-wanted-to-seize-kursk-nuclear-power-plant-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T08:21:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/-------_---.jpeg
Russian bank offers preferential mortgages in occupied parts of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk oblasts	Russia&apos;s VTB Bank has opened applications for preferential mortgages in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, the state-controlled Interfax news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing the bank&apos;s press service. Moscow has launched incentives for Russian citizens to settle in the occupied territories while thousands of Ukrainians fled, aiming to Russify the conquered land. The Russian banking giant offered interest rates as low as 2%, according to Interfax, and plans to expand its offer to the occupied territories in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as soon as &quot;housing constructions&quot; start there. Russia&apos;s war has laid waste to the Ukrainian cities and villages, leaving many of them in ruins. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of the four aforementioned oblasts in September 2022. Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been occupied since the start of the Russian aggression in 2014. Kyiv says peace talks should be held on the condition of Russia&apos;s full withdrawal from Ukraine. VTB specified that the 2% annual rate would be fixed for the entire loan term, up to 30 years, with an initial payment of 10.1% of the housing price and loan amounts reaching up to 6 million rubles ($62,000). The partially state-owned bank&apos;s decision comes after Putin&apos;s call on banks to expand their services in the occupied territories at the beginning of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-vtb-bank-offers-preferential-mortgages-in-occupied-ukrainian-territories/	2024-10-30T07:18:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1238687055.jpg
Kremlin denies Russia-Ukraine talks on halting energy strikes	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied alleged talks with Ukraine about mutually halting strikes on energy infrastructure, the Russian state news agency TASS reported on Oct. 30. The denial comes a day after the Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia are resuming discussions about halting the strikes on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure after the talks abruptly ended in August following Ukraine&apos;s Kursk incursion. According to a senior Ukrainian official, Moscow and Kyiv have already reduced the frequency of attacks on energy infrastructure in recent weeks as part of an agreement reached by their intelligence services, Ukrainian news outlet New Voice reported on Oct. 30. An agreement would mark the most significant de-escalation of the war since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21 that a willingness on Russia&#x2019;s part to halt the strikes might signal a willingness to start broader peace talks. Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter yet, with half of its energy infrastructure in ruins after Russia launched massive campaigns against the country&apos;s energy grid in the autumn-winter period of 2023-2023, and again in the spring of 2024. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-denies-russia-ukraine-talks-on-halting-energy-strikes/	2024-10-30T06:28:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Slovak PM interviewed by top Russian propagandist	Slovakia&apos;s Prime Minister Robert Fico gave an online interview to chief Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, with parts published on Skabeyeva&apos;s Telegram channel on Oct. 30. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. Talking to the propagandist sanctioned by several Western countries, the prime minister of a NATO and EU member country discussed several topics, including the Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the supposed Western fatigue over the support of Ukraine. Fico also reiterated his desire to visit Moscow for the May 9 Victory Day celebrations. Based on the snippets published on Skabeyeva&apos;s channel, Fico claimed that in April 2022, real agreements were on the table that could immediately end the war. The unsuccessful talks in 2022 held in Belarus and Turkey were the only occasion when Ukraine and Russia took part in direct negotiations. A resulting draft treaty, which reportedly precluded Ukraine from joining NATO and postponed the matter of occupied territories, was never signed due to disagreement on several key points and a shifting tide on the battlefield. &quot;And today we all look at this war, and I feel, excuse the frankness, we look away and say: Here are your weapons, here is your money, fight, just don&apos;t bore us with it, we just don&apos;t want to have anything to do with it anymore, with this war,&quot; the Slovak prime minister said. Fico expressed skepticism over earlier reports that the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up by Ukrainian officers, calling the allegation &quot;nonsense.&quot; He also said it was his personal duty to visit Moscow on the 80th anniversary, marking the end of the Second World War.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-interviewed-by-top-russian-propagandist/	2024-10-30T06:08:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Fico.png
No confidentiality between partners — Zelensky calls out White House over Tomahawk missiles leak	Ukraine&apos;s request for Tomahawk missiles was &quot;confidential information,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 30, complaining about a lack of confidentiality between Kyiv and Washington. The New York Times reported on Oct. 29 that, according to undisclosed U.S. officials, the request for Tomahawk missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) was part of the secretive &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; included in Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. The sources told the outlet that Washington was unconvinced that Ukraine needed the weaponry and was reluctant to supply them due to their limited numbers. &quot;It was confidential information between Ukraine and the White House. How to understand these messages?&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing with journalists from Nordic countries. &quot;So this means (that) between partners, there is no (confidentiality).&quot; According to Zelensky, Ukraine requested the missiles on the condition that it would deploy them only if Russia refused to end its war and de-escalate. &quot;I said that this is a preventive method. I was told that it is an escalation,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv has been trying to secure additional assistance from U.S. President Joe Biden before he leaves office in January. There are fears that Washington might scale down its support if Republican nominee Donald Trump wins the election on Nov. 5. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky pitched the five-step victory plan, containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan were met with a lukewarm response from partners, with the White House still refusing to permit long-range strikes on Russian territory and several countries resisting a NATO invitation for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-out-white-house/	2024-10-30T05:32:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 79	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 78 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 21- Oct. 27, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&apos;s parliament will consider the accounting chamber reform in the second reading and the draft law on the 2025 State Budget. During the parliamentarian meetings scheduled for Oct. 21-31, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, will consider draft law #10044-d on reforming the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine. The budget committee prepared and approved the text for the second reading last week. The draft law is not only a structural benchmark of the latest memorandum with the International Monetary Fund, but an obligation for U.S. financial assistance with a deadline of the end of October. As we reported in Issue 72, the draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the chamber&apos;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the accounting chamber to all public finances and strengthening its independence. Moreover, the parliament will consider draft law #12000 on the State Budget for 2025 after the budget committee revised all amendments submitted by lawmakers. The Committee&apos;s meeting was scheduled for Oct. 28. The results of voting for new members of the Bureau of Economic Security Civil Oversight Council had to be announced on Monday. On Oct. 27, an online competition for the new Bureau of Economic Security&apos;s Civil Oversight Council was closed. Forty-four candidates took part in the competition. The list of nine winners had to be announced and published on the Bureau of Economic Security official website on Oct. 28. After that the Cabinet of Ministers should officially appoint these &#xA0;winners as members of a new Civil Oversight Council of the ESBU for the next two years. At the time of sending this newsletter on Oct. 28, the results had not yet been announced. The draft law on a tax increase has not been signed for two weeks. On Oct. 15, draft law #11416-d on tax increase which was considered as urgent by the Presidential Office still hasn&#x2019;t been signed for 14 days. It seems that President Volodymyr Zelensky is going to sign the bill so that it can come into force from Nov. 1. Such a step will prevent businesses from implementing legal collisions when the increased military levy has to be paid only for several days of October. The president signed two draft laws required in the Ukraine Plan. Last week, the President signed draft law #10143 with amendments to the bankruptcy code to improve bankruptcy procedures and harmonize them with the EU legislation. The adoption of this bill is also required by the World Bank Development Policy Financing (DPF). The president also signed draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy. The parliament will consider a draft law on plea agreements, the deadline has already passed. During the parliamentarian meetings scheduled for Oct. 21-31, the Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law # 12039 to improve the mechanism of plea bargaining in grand corruption cases. The deadline for this step has expired in September. As we reported in Issue 77, the revised draft law allows for a shorter prison term than currently required in case of cooperation with the investigation through exposure of accomplices and compensation for damage. This mechanism can&#x2019;t be applied as a general rule to organizers of corruption schemes, with the exception of cases where such an organizer exposes another organizer. The president signed the draft law on publishing detailed prices of SOEs&#x2019; construction procurements. The President signed the draft law #11057 on changes in public procurement procedures for the state-owned enterprises. The draft law suggests provision on mandatory publication of breakdown of costs for every construction contract following public procurement in order to ensure transparent pricing and prevent inflated prices. Zelensky announced cash payments to Ukrainian citizens to spend on locally produced goods. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Cabinet of Ministers to allocate government funding for every Ukrainian to receive Hr 1,000 (around $24) by Dec. 1 to be spent on domestically-produced goods or services. Speakers who had to advocate the initiative were instructed to explain the decision with the fact that international financial support could not be used for military purposes, and such a step is meant to boost consumption.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-79/	2024-10-30T04:48:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky.jpeg
Ex-Google CEO urges US to buy drones instead of 'useless' tanks, cites Ukraine experience	The U.S. military should replace its &quot;useless&quot; tanks with AI-powered drones, Google&apos;s former CEO Eric Schmidt said on Oct. 30, Bloomberg reported. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia, Schmidt said that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine showed how a &quot;$5,000 drone can destroy a $5 million tank.&quot; According to Forbes, Schmidt has been quietly building a startup in the U.S. and Ukraine for the production of military drones. The White Stork project aims to manufacture unmanned aerial vehicles using artificial intelligence and resistant to GPS jamming, the outlet wrote. The former chief executive of Google and ex-chairman of its parent company, Alphabet, is also backing the startup Istari, which seeks to modernize the U.S. military with cutting-edge AI technology. &quot;The cost of autonomy is falling so quickly that the drone war, which is the future of conflict, will get rid of eventually tanks, artillery, mortars,&quot; said Schmidt, who has been an advisor to U.S. defense officials on emerging technologies. Schmidt believes that Western militaries are adapting too slowly to new technology trends of the modern-day battlefield. Ukraine and Russia have pioneered drone technology throughout the full-scale war. Kyiv, in particular, has been using cheaper drones in innovative ways to offset its limited resource pool compared to Moscow or NATO militaries. Ukrainian drones have been used to devastate the Russian Black Sea Fleet, drop molten metal on Russian positions, and intercept Russian helicopters. Some military experts warned against dismissing traditional weapon systems like tanks as obsolete, however. &quot;The wars in Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh (in 2020) both show that mobile armored platforms with firepower are still important,&quot; defense expert Rob Lee wrote in a War on the Rocks article. The analyst connected the tank losses Russian forces suffered in the early phase of the war to inadequate use of combined arms and weak logistics.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-google-ceo-urges-us-to-buy-more-drones/	2024-10-30T04:47:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1328571734.jpg
North Korean soldiers 50 km from Ukraine's border, including special forces, FT reports	Around 3,000 North Korean troops that arrived in Kursk Oblast were housed in barracks only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed Ukrainian intelligence officials. A few hundred of those are special forces, with the rest being regular troops, one source said. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. Recent reports suggest that a small number may already be in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, while Ukraine put the total number at 12,000. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as a main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-50-km-from-ukraines-border-ft/	2024-10-30T03:44:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
South Korea reportedly not considering direct 155 mm ammunition supplies to Ukraine	South Korea is currently not considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean presidential official. Seoul has not received such a request from the Ukrainian side, and the matter is not under consideration, the source told the South Korean news agency amid speculations of South Korea&apos;s shifting stance on the issue. South Korea has not provided direct lethal support to Kyiv as its legislation prohibits supplying arms to a warzone, though unconfirmed reports suggested Ukraine has obtained South Korean shells indirectly via the U.S. The country&apos;s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said South Korea might revise its stance in the light of deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea, namely in regards to the dispatch of North Korean troops to join the war. A South Korean delegation is expected to visit Ukraine this week to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. Kyiv also plans to send a special envoy to South Korea, and the two countries will discuss the topic this week, Yonhap reported. &quot;It will take a day or two for the Ukrainian side to designate a special envoy and finalize a plan to visit and hold discussions here,&quot; the official told the news agency. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea. Russia is also believed to be preparing the deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops, with at least some of them in combat roles. A small number of North Korean soldiers have already arrived in Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing Western intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-shells-ukraine/	2024-10-30T03:19:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175191081.jpg
Georgian prosecutors open investigation into election fraud allegations	Georgia&#x2019;s Prosecution Service said on Oct. 30 that it would open an investigation into mounting reports of the falsification of the parliamentary elections held on Oct. 26. The ruling Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party declared victory with 54% of the vote, despite accusations by international observers and domestic oppositions about rigged elections. &quot;The Prosecution Service of Georgia has launched an investigation into the alleged falsification of the parliamentary elections,&quot; the statement read on Oct. 30. The office summoned President Salome Zurabishvili for Oct. 31 as part of the investigation. The president refused to acknowledge the result, calling it a &quot;Russian special operation&quot; and urged voters to protest. Many Georgians heeded her call and took to the streets to protest the result and the alleged fraud. While most exit polls indicated a victory for a pro-European coalition, the official results claimed that oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s Georgian Dream had won with 53.9%. The opposition coalition received 37.8%. Numerous foreign and domestic observers provided evidence of large-scale voting fraud, accusing the authorities of stealing the opposition&apos;s victory. The government, which has been run by Georgian Dream for 12 years, denied the accusations. &quot;The Prosecution Service of Georgia will conduct all necessary investigative and procedural actions to study the facts raised in the CEC&apos;s (Central Election Commission) statement, as well as those mentioned by the President of Georgia, certain political parties, and the representatives of election observation missions,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. The Election Commission said it would recount votes at a few arbitrarily selected polling stations to address the accusations. All four parties of the pro-European opposition coalition said they would refuse to join the new parliament due to the alleged vote rigging. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze rejected the accusations of vote rigging in an interview with BBC on Oct. 28 and added that &quot;irregularities happen everywhere, in every country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-prosecutors-open-investigation-into-election-fraud-allegations/	2024-10-30T02:32:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180900189.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 41 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 41 over the past day, including children, the regional authorities reported on the morning of Oct. 30. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 33 of the 62 Russian Shahed-type drones launched overnight, according to the Air Force. Twenty-three of the drones were &#xA0;reported as &quot;lost.&quot; Russia launched yet another drone attack against Kyiv. Fallen debris damaged a multi-story residential building, starting a fire and injuring nine people, including a child, the city&apos;s authorities reported. Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast killed one person in the village of Sukhi Yaly and injured 10 elsewhere in the oblast, Governor Vadym Filaskin reported. Five people were wounded in the village of Oleksievo-Druzhkivka, two in the town of Myrnohrad, and the remaining three in Kurakhove, Lyman, and Druhkivka. In Kharkiv Oblast, four people were injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 39-year-old woman was reportedly injured in the village of Tsaredarivka. Two women aged 68 and 74 and a 10-year-old child were also wounded in the village of Bezruky, the governor reported. Russian strikes against Kherson Oblast killed three people and injured 15, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Moscow&apos;s forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, an educational institution, a store, and residential areas. Three people were injured in attacks against Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. One resident was wounded during attacks against the Velyka Pysarivka community on Oct. 29, and two civilians were injured in the Khotin community overnight on Oct. 30. Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-102/	2024-10-30T02:14:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kyiv-Oct-30.jpg
Death toll of Russia's Kryvyi Rih strike on Oct. 28 rises to 2	The death toll of a Russian missile attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Oct. 28 has risen to two as a man died in the hospital, a local official said on Oct. 30. &quot;Unfortunately, a 55-year-old man died at 8:50 a.m.,&quot; said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, on his Telegram channel. The devastating attack damaged 11 apartment buildings, a medical clinic, a school, an administrative building, 10 garages, and a gas pipeline. Initially, one person was reported as killed and 14 people as injured, 10 of whom were hospitalized. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. With a population of around 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city lies about 70 kilometers northwest of the nearest front-line zone. Russia has launched a number of aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities over the past few days, namely targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/death-toll-of-russias-kryvyi-rih-strike-on-oct-28-rises-to-2/	2024-10-30T01:41:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-28-17_08_54.jpeg
Russian hackers targeting US officials, Microsoft warns	Russian hacker group Midnight Blizzard has been sending highly targeted phishing emails to U.S. individuals working in government, academia, defense, and non-governmental organizations, Microsoft warned in a blog post on Oct. 29. The warning came exactly a week before the U.S. presidential election, with U.S. intelligence accusing Russia of interference to undermine the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. During the campaign, detected by Microsoft on Oct. 22, thousands of emails were sent to more than 100 organizations. According to Microsoft, the goal of the ongoing operation is likely intelligence gathering. &quot;Based on our investigation of previous Midnight Blizzard spear-phishing campaigns, we assess that the goal of this operation is likely intelligence collection,&quot; Microsoft said. The hacker group has been linked by the United States and the United Kingdom to Russia&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Their activity dates back to 2018, and they usually target governments, diplomatic entities, NGOs, and IT service providers, primarily in the United States and Europe. Phishing emails use social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients. They exploit emotions like fear, urgency, or curiosity to trick them into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. These emails often impersonate trusted entities, such as banks or government agencies, making them appear legitimate and increasing the likelihood of victim response.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-targeting-us-officials-microsoft-warns/	2024-10-30T01:26:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
Ukraine should strike back if North Korean troops cross into its territory, Biden says	U.S. President Joe Biden said Kyiv should strike back at North Korean troops &quot;if they go into Ukraine&quot; during a press conference on Oct. 29. A Pentagon spokesman added at a separate briefing that Moscow&#x2019;s recourse to North Korean troops reflects a &quot;dire situation&quot; of its manpower. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, part of whom is already deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;I am concerned about it, yes,&quot; Biden answered to a question regarding their arrival, adding that Ukraine should strike back if the troops enter into Ukrainian territory, but did not elaborate further. In a separate news briefing on Oct. 28, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said a &quot;relatively small number&quot; of North Korean troops are already in Kursk, echoing recent comments by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said thousands more troops are expected to head there in the coming weeks. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-north-korean-troops-ukraine/	2024-10-30T00:29:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
Chechnya drone strike: Kadyrov claims to use Ukrainian POWs as human shields	Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov on Oct. 29 apparently boasted about using Ukrainian prisoners as human shields, claiming there were casualties among the captives after a drone strike on Chechnya. The Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes was damaged by a drone attack early on Oct. 29, marking the first drone strike against Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic. Putin&apos;s ally Kadyrov, who accused Ukraine of the attack, initially said that the targeted building was empty and there were no casualties, only to change his statement later on and claim that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) were killed as a result. Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack nor commented on Kadyrov&apos;s claims. &quot;Up to 10 Ukrainian prisoners are held at each strategic facility in the (Chechen) republic, including on the territory of the Russian Special Forces University,&quot; Kadyrov claimed on his Telegram channel. The use of prisoners as human shields is banned under the Geneva Convention and classified as a war crime. &quot;Kyiv, trying to harm us, killed its own soldiers today,&quot; the dictator said, providing no evidence to back his allegations. The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) for comment but has not received a response at the time of the publication. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29 that the drone strike was possibly launched from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia and may have been connected to a feud between Kadyrov and officials from the two regions. Speaking to the media after the strike, Kadyrov also said that he ordered all of his commanders fighting against Ukraine &quot;not to take prisoners and destroy&quot; Ukrainian soldiers as retribution. Ukraine has documented over 100 cases of Russia summarily executing Ukrainian POWs since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets clarified that the actual number is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence, such as videos of the executions.	https://kyivindependent.com/kadyrov-claims-to-use-ukrainian-pows-as-human-shields/	2024-10-30T00:18:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2024-05-06-22_34_26.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 693,640 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 693,640 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 30. This number includes 1,560 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,137 tanks, 18,433 armored fighting vehicles, 27,840 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,955 artillery systems, 1,242 multiple launch rocket systems, 986 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,979 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-693-640-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-29T23:14:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175040445.jpg
Russian drone debris hits residential building in Kyiv, 9 injured	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian drones targeted Kyiv during an overnight attack on Oct. 30, city authorities reported. Nine people were injured in the incident, including an 11-year-old girl, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Debris from a drone attack had fallen in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district, causing a fire in a multi-story residential building, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. Eighteen residents were evacuated from their apartments. The fire has since been extinguished. &quot;Rescue services are working on the spot. Medics are also on duty on the spot,&quot; Klitschko wrote on Telegram. Just a few days ago, a Russian suicide drone hit a 25-story residential building in the same district on Oct. 25, killing a teenage girl and injuring five people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-debris-hits-residential-building-in-kyiv-9-injured/	2024-10-29T23:06:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kmva2.jpg
Hungarian FM to attend and speak at Eurasian security conference in Belarus this week	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto is set to speak at the Minsk Conference on Eurasian Security in Belarus on October 31, Politico reported. Other participants will include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Bassam al-Sabbagh. Representatives from 45 countries are expected. According to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the event should be viewed as a competitor to the Munich Security Conference. The CSTO was established in 2002 and includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russia is by far the most powerful member of the alliance, which is similar to NATO in its structure. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has indicated that the event will focus on discussing and shaping future Eurasian security. Szijjarto frequently visits Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Minsk, emphasizing Hungary&apos;s reliance on Russian energy during a recent seminar organized by Gazprom. He was the first high-ranking EU official to visit Belarus in 2023, following the government&apos;s crackdown on opposition and support for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, he has been the only EU foreign minister to visit the country. Hungary has remained the most Kremlin-friendly country within the EU and has repeatedly opposed Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the European bloc, obstructed sanctions on Russia, and undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-fm-to-attend-and-speak-at-eurasian-security-conference-in-belarus-this-week/	2024-10-29T21:21:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Ukrainian and Russian officials to resume discussions on stopping energy plant attacks, FT reports	Ukraine and Russia are reportedly holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29. Earlier talks mediated by Qatar in August nearly reached an agreement but fell through after Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Discussions, in the early stages, are expected to resume sometime soon. Moscow remains firm that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Kursk before any agreement is made. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. According to a senior Ukrainian official, energy infrastructure attacks have already decreased in the past few weeks, based on a deal established through Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s respective intelligence agencies. With winter approaching, Ukraine faces critical energy challenges due to the prior damage inflicted by extensive Russian strikes. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-and-russian-officials-to-resume-discussions-on-stopping-energy-plant-attacks-ft-reports/	2024-10-29T20:00:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167778055.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of over 75,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Through open-source research, Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, together with BBC Russia, confirmed the names of 75,382 Russian soldiers who had been killed since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in mid-October, the names of 2,483 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The last few weeks, amid ongoing battles in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts as well as in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Oct. 25 reported 1,630 Russian casualties in the previous day marking Russia&apos;s second deadliest day since the start of full-scale war. The numbers surpassed the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set a week prior. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, which reportedly began fighting alongside Russian forces in limited numbers on Oct. 29. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,200 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 14,095 Russian convicts have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. A surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. As of Oct. 29, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 692,080 troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-over-75-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-10-29T16:37:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Ukraine facing 'most difficult' winter since start of full-scale war, Ukrenergo chief says	The interim head of Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo, Oleksiy Brekht, said on Oct. 29 that the country may be facing its most challenging winter since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, as Ukraine prepares for more Russian attacks against energy infrastructure. &quot;The winter will be the hardest of the previous three years,&quot; Brekht told Suspilne in an excerpt of an interview published Oct. 29. Brekht said that if Russia continues its onslaught of attacks against critical energy infrastructure as it did last winter, then Ukrainians may face up to eight hours of power outages on the most &quot;critical&quot; days. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Previously, Serhiy Kovalenko, the CEO of energy supplier Yasno, warned in June that Ukrainians may have electricity for just 6-7 hours per day in the winter, depending on how much of the grid can be repaired Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. During the interview, Brekht said that Ukraine lost 9 gigawatts (GW) in generating capacity earlier this year due to Russian attacks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on September 19 that the EU aims to cover around 4.5 GW of energy capacity this winter, or roughly 25% of Ukraine&apos;s winter needs. Earlier in the day on Oct. 29, the EU said that it will increase their export capacity to 2.1 GW starting Dec. 1. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 GW this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. Despite the concern of officials, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 10 the country has protected 85% of its energy infrastructure in anticipation of further Russian attacks. Brekht&apos;s comments echo made by NATO&apos;s Secretary General Mark Rutte on Oct. 8 who also warned that &quot;massive strikes&quot; against Ukrainian infrastructure may disrupt energy production.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-facing-the-most-difficult-winter-since-start-of-war-ukrenergo-chief-says/	2024-10-29T15:50:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154248575.jpg
US urging China to pressure North Korea to withdraw troops from Ukraine's front line, CNN reports	United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been urging China, which maintains relations with North Korea, to put pressure on Pyongyang to withdraw North Korean troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. According to the unnamed official, Sullivan &#x201C;directed the US government to engage the PRC to organize an effort to get other countries to reach out to the PRC as well over our concerns about DPRK sending troops into Russia and the implications of that&#x201D; &#x2014; using PRC to refer to the country&apos;s full name as the People&apos;s Republic of China. CNN reported on Oct. 29 that a small number of North Korean forces are already on the territory of Ukraine, citing two Western intelligence officers. NATO and the Pentagon previously confirmed that North Korean troops were training in Russia and that some of them were on their way to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, part of which Ukrainian forces have controlled since August. Speaking at a press conference on Oct. 28, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that the U.S. has been in contact with China about North Korea troop presence alongside Ukraine&apos;s front line, but did not provide detail on the conversations. &#x201C;We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,&#x201D; Miller said. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Despite the urging of the United States, some Western officials are pessimistic about the country&apos;s ability to pressure China into helping pull back North Korean troops, with a NATO official telling CNN that China has been a &quot;critical enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine On Oct. 24, China denied that it was of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite warnings from the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia &#x2013; allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urging-china-to-pressure-north-korea-to-withdraw-troops-from-ukraines-front-line-cnn-reports/	2024-10-29T14:28:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-1151086996-612x612.jpg
Georgia sinks deeper into Russian-style authoritarianism amid stolen election allegations	Georgia&apos;s Oct. 26 parliamentary election presented a clear geopolitical choice for the country&#x2019;s voters, but criticism is mounting that the ruling regime stole the vote. After years of vacillating between the West and Russia and paying lip service to European integration, the country&apos;s ruling Georgian Dream party began to mimic the Kremlin&#x2019;s playbook, tarnishing the country&#x2019;s relations with the West. While most exit polls indicated a victory for a pro-European coalition, the official results claimed that oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s Georgian Dream had won with 53.9%. The opposition coalition received 37.8%. Numerous foreign and domestic observers provided evidence of large-scale voting fraud, accusing the authorities of stealing the opposition&apos;s victory. The government, which has been run by the Georgian Dream for 12 years, denied the accusations. All four parties of the pro-European opposition coalition said they would refuse to join the new parliament due to vote rigging, and the country&apos;s pro-European President, Salome Zourabichvili, took the unprecedented step of refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the election. Citizens of Georgia take part in Parliamentary Elections in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 26, 2024. (Nicolo Vincenzo Malvestuto/Getty Images)Yet the ruling party appears set to preserve its grip on power for now. &quot;(If the Georgian Dream&apos;s victory holds), Georgia will be a satellite state of Russia &#x2013; a mix of Belarus and Chechnya, a fully autocratic regime,&quot; Marika Mikiashvili, a Georgian analyst and member of the Droa opposition party, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(The Georgian Dream) has realized that the only way for them to maintain their power is to ally themselves with Russia.&quot; EU foreign ministers said in a joint statement on Oct. 28 that they &quot;condemn all violations of international norms for free and fair elections&quot; and &quot;demand an impartial inquiry of complaints and remedy of the violations established.&quot; &quot;The violations of electoral integrity are incompatible with the standards expected from a candidate to the European Union,&quot; they said. &quot;They are a betrayal of the Georgian people&#x2019;s legitimate European aspiration. Upholding the rule of law and free and fair elections is integral to any progress on Georgia&#x2019;s EU path.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned &#x201C;all contraventions of international norms&#x201D; in the Georgian election on Oct. 28 and joined &#x201C;calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations.&#x201D; What happens next remains unclear. Opposition politicians and activists have hoped that protests could force the Georgian Dream to hold a new election. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tbilisi on Oct. 28, making their demands heard. Much depends on whether protests or Western pressure will force the Georgian Dream to audit the election results or hold a new vote. The Georgian Dream did not respond to requests for comment. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze rejected the accusations of vote rigging in an interview with BBC on Oct. 28 and added that &quot;irregularities happen everywhere, in every country.&quot; Georgia&apos;s central election commission agreed on Oct. 29 to recount votes at a small number of randomly selected polling stations. The Georgian Dream&apos;s opponents point to the discrepancy between most exit polls and the official results as evidence of massive vote rigging. An exit poll ordered by the pro-government channel Imedi estimated the Georgian Dream&apos;s result at 56%, while several other exit polls commissioned by opposition TV channels, including one conducted by U.S. polling agency Edison Research, put the number at around 40%. Georgian election analyst Levan Kvirkvelia published charts that he says prove voting fraud in the election. &quot;Voting results typically follow a bell curve &#x2014; this is called a normal distribution,&quot; he said on X on Oct. 28. &quot;Any deviation from this pattern needs explanation... In the rural areas, there&apos;s an unusual &apos;tail&apos; on the right, hinting at fraud, often called the &apos;Russian tail.&apos; This pattern suggests ballots were stuffed or miscounted.&quot; Georgian oligarch and founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili (C) and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze (R) react during a gathering at the party&apos;s headquarters after exit polls were announced during parliamentary elections in Tbilisi, Georgia on Oct. 26, 2024. (Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)George Melashvili, founder of the Europe-Georgia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that the scale of voting fraud was bigger than in previous elections, saying that &quot;this election was stolen from the Georgian people.&quot; David Sakvarelidze, a top prosecutor in Georgia under ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, agreed, telling the Kyiv Independent that &quot;nobody expected such blatant lawlessness.&quot; Sakvarelidze, an opponent of the Georgian Dream, moved to Kyiv after Saakashvili lost power in 2013 and served as a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine from 2015 to 2016. President Zourabishvili said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian Dream government was illegitimate and called the election a &quot;complete falsification.&quot; &#x201C;We were not just witnesses but also victims of what can only be described as a Russian special operation &#x2013; a new form of hybrid warfare waged against our people and our country,&quot; she added. Opposition lawmakers and their supporters alleged that Russia was involved, either as an inspiration for the steal or as a direct participant. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 21, citing documents it had obtained, that Russian spies had been watching Georgia&#x2019;s government and major companies in a comprehensive espionage and hacking campaign over years.

(Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)During the election campaign, the Georgian Dream tried to drive home the message that a victory for the opposition would mean war with Russia, showing pictures of war-torn Ukraine. &quot;There was a hysteric campaign to scare Georgians with the threat of war and demonize Ukraine and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky,&quot; Sakvarelidze said. Despite its declared victory, the Georgian Dream is facing a number of stumbling blocks. All the four opposition parties elected to parliament refused to join it due to voting fraud. The president&apos;s refusal to recognize the new parliament was also a major blow to its legitimacy. According to Georgia&apos;s Constitution, &quot;parliament shall acquire full powers once this is acknowledged by two-thirds of the members of parliament.&quot; The Georgian Dream will not have two-thirds, and some commentators interpreted this to mean that parliament will not be able to function. But Prime Minister Kobakhidze said that parliament would start working despite the opposition&apos;s refusal to join it. Mikiashvili and Melashvili said that parliament would not have full powers without two thirds of the MPs but it would still be able to function under the Constitution. Parliament will be able to pass most laws without a two-thirds majority but will not be able to change the Constitution or impeach the president, according to Mikiashvili. &quot;It will be a North Korean-style one-party parliament, but technically, it will be able to function,&quot; Melashvili said. Moreover, it is not clear how long the opposition coalition&apos;s unity will continue and whether some of the opposition lawmakers will decide to join the new parliament. After the 2020 election, the opposition also initially boycotted the parliament but later reached a compromise with the Georgian Dream and joined it. Another factor that may affect future political developments in Georgia is the West&apos;s position. The European Union has expressed concern over reports of massive voting fraud. &quot;We... call on (Georgia&apos;s) Central Election Commission and other relevant authorities to fulfill their duty to swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof,&quot; Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said on Oct. 27. Mikiashvili said that the West should refuse to recognize the rigged election and impose sanctions on the Georgian authorities. Sakvarelidze said that &quot;the EU has been turning a blind eye to the Georgian government&apos;s violations&quot; and called on the West to &quot;take decisive action.&quot; &quot;If you don&apos;t shake hands with (the Georgian Dream), they will be uncomfortable,&quot; he said. The Georgian opposition and pro-West political commentators believe that election fraud and the increased hostility between the country and the West will push Georgia into Russia&#x2019;s arms. Melashvili said, however, that it would be hard for the Georgian Dream to set up a full-blown dictatorship because it had failed to achieve its goal of receiving a constitutional majority in parliament. He argued that the Georgian Dream would try to perpetuate &quot;creeping pro-Russian authoritarianism similar to Hungary and Serbia.&quot; &quot;This election is the last chance to catch up with Ukraine and Moldova on their path to European integration,&quot; Melashvili added. &quot;If the Georgian Dream succeeds in stealing the election, Georgia&apos;s European integration will be halted.&quot; Georgian political analyst Gela Vasadze told the Kyiv Independent that the scenario of a pro-Russian dictatorship was possible but said that &quot;Georgian (civil) society would have to be destroyed to implement such a scenario.&quot; People attend an opposition rally where Georgia&apos;s President Salome Zurabishvili protests results of the parliamentary elections that showed a win for the ruling Georgian Dream party outside the parliament building in central Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 28, 2024.

Saakashvili&apos;s government was in constant conflict with Russia, which increased its hold on the country&#x2019;s two autonomous regions &#x2013; Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2008, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country, fully establishing control over the two now breakaway regions. Saakashvili&#x2019;s domestic support plummeted following the war and the political scandals that occurred during his time in office. The Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party won the 2012 parliament elections in a landslide, while the country moved from a presidential to a parliamentary system. The Georgian Dream kept the goal of joining the European Union and NATO but also declared plans to improve relations with Russia. &quot;You can&apos;t succeed in Georgia if you don&apos;t promise European integration,&quot; Mikiashvili said. &quot;For many years (the Georgian Dream) maintained strategic ambiguity and portrayed themselves as pro-European.&quot; Melashvili said that &quot;the Georgian Dream was trying to sit on two chairs and create a perception of European integration.&quot; People attend an opposition rally where President Salome Zurabishvili protests the parliamentary election results outside the Tbilisi parliament, Georgia on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)The Georgian Dream government concluded an association agreement with the EU in 2016 and achieved visa-free travel with the EU in 2017. Georgia received EU candidate status in 2023. But in recent years, the Georgian Dream has stepped up anti-Western and pro-Russian rhetoric and moved towards closer ties with the Kremlin. It has also adopted some Russian-style measures to obstruct the work of liberal non-government organizations and cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. Amid the improving relations with Tbilisi, Russia introduced visa-free travel with Georgia and canceled the ban on direct flights. Business ties have also improved. As a result of the pro-Russian drift, the EU suspended accession talks with Georgia, and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Georgian officials in June 2024. Pro-Western anti-government demonstrations have also become a regular occurrence in the country&#x2019;s capital. Melashvili said that the Georgian Dream became more pro-Russian during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;They were sure Kyiv would fall and were preparing for a reality in which Russia would be dominant,&quot; he said. &quot;But this is at odds with what the Georgians wanted.&quot; Mikiashvili argued that the Georgian Dream would not have been able to stay in power if it had implemented pro-Western democratic reforms and moved out of Russia&#x2019;s orbit. In that case, they would have likely been ousted in a democratic election, she added. &quot;Russia is their only guarantee for staying in power,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-sinks-deeper-into-pro-russian-authoritarianism-critics-say-citing-stolen-election/	2024-10-29T13:52:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180430858.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia claims capture of Selydove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Key developments on Oct. 29: Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 29 that its forces had captured the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, which lies close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. Observers and the Ukrainian military have warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. While Kyiv did not confirm whether Russia captured the town, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;There can be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost,&quot; said Emil Kastehelmi, a military expert and open-source intelligence (OSINT) analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &quot;That&apos;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove. The town&apos;s fall would spell dire news for Pokrovsk, which lies only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, with their push in Donetsk Oblast recently gaining a long-unseen pace. Selydove was home to around 21,000 people before the full-scale invasion in 2022. Russia&apos;s offensive, accompanied by artillery barrages and heavy aerial bombardment, has driven thousands of civilians from their homes. A small number of North Korean forces are already on the territory of Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing two Western intelligence officers. NATO and the Pentagon previously confirmed that North Korean troops were training in Russia and that some of them were on their way to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, part of which Ukrainian forces have controlled since August. There was no confirmation of the presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine before. &quot;It seems that a good many of them are already in action,&quot; one of the officials told CNN, referring to the North Koreans. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. U.S. and South Korean diplomatic and military officials will meet in Washington this week to discuss North Korea&apos;s &quot;expanding relationship with Russia,&quot; said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak is also currently in Washington. According to CNN, he met with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and State Secretary Antony Blinken on Oct. 29. Yermak mentioned that he and Sullivan discussed &quot;North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.&quot; How helpful the North Korean military will be to the Russian army on the battlefield is not yet clear. Many of the North Korean troops are special forces, and intelligence assessments suggest that Pyongyang believes its troops have greater combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials told CNN. The North Korean military has not been involved in a war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them there largely so they could gain combat experience. Officials also expect that at least some of the soldiers will desert their units once they are on the battlefield and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant obstacle to smooth operations. The Russians are teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, such as &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;back to your position,&quot; South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Oct. 29. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia &#x2013; allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. Three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. However, doubts remain in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice. President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for Tomahawk missiles from the U.S. as part of the &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; in his victory plan, the New York Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan comprises five points with three classified parts. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, a part of which is classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression, a part of which would consist of receiving Tomahawk missiles, according to the Times&apos; report. Tomahawk missiles have a range of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), seven times the range of the long-range missile systems called ATACMS that Ukraine received from the U.S. According to the officials, Ukraine did not manage to convince Western diplomats why it needed Tomahawks. The number of Ukraine&#x2019;s targets in Russia also allegedly far exceeds the stockpiles the U.S. could hand over without jeopardizing its interests in the Middle East and Asia. The outlet also cites four U.S. officials who claimed Zelensky was surprised that U.S. President Joe Biden did not grant him permission to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia when they met in Washington in September. This was confirmed by Zelensky&apos;s office. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 28, the Yonhap news agency reported. Yoon&apos;s comments come shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. &quot;I hope that under Secretary General Rutte&apos;s leadership, NATO will redouble efforts to monitor and block illegal exchanges between Russia and North Korea in solidarity and coordination,&quot; Yoon said. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Yoon added that the South Korean delegation will brief the EU Political and Security Committee on Oct. 29, after which they will travel to Ukraine to meet with intelligence and defense officials to exchange battlefield information and explore cooperation measures. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon commented. Romania could shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace based on the level of threat, according to a draft law published by the Romanian Defense Ministry on Oct. 28. Bucharest reported numerous cases of Russian drones crashing on its territory or violating its airspace near the Ukrainian border following mass strikes on Ukraine. According to the proposed legislation, the Romanian military would be able to intercept and, when necessary, destroy piloted and unmanned aircraft breaching its airspace under certain circumstances. The document must be approved by the Romanian government and the parliament. Depending on the level of threat, &quot;unauthorized&quot; drones may be disabled or taken control of with &quot;non-kinetic&quot; means or shot down. The interception of a piloted aircraft would follow several steps, including establishing radio contact, transmitting instructions to the pilot, and firing a warning shot. The use of &quot;destructive force&quot; by aircraft or ground-based air defenses would be the last resort. The Romanian military would attempt to shoot down the aircraft only after establishing all the circumstances and the level of threat and taking into account international law and the safety of people&apos;s lives and property, the document says. Allied forces stationed in Romania would be permitted to take part in the operations. Romania has urged NATO partners to present a &quot;robust and coordinated&quot; response to Russian missiles and drones violating the allied airspace. Latvia and Poland also reported similar breaches. Ukraine has urged NATO to intercept Russian drones and missiles over Ukrainian airspace both to protect Ukraine and their own countries. No country has committed to that step so far nor intercepted Russian projectiles in its airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-claims-capture-of-selydove-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2024-10-29T12:52:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSCF6203.jpg
Fire breaks out at Slovak factory producing artillery shells for Ukraine	The premises of the ZVS Holding company, which produces artillery shells for Ukraine and other contractors, caught fire in the Slovak city of Snina, Slovak news outlet Dennik N reported on Oct. 29. The fire broke out at 1:30 p.m. local time in a hydraulic press used for the three-dimensional molding of steel shell casings. By late afternoon, it had engulfed the oil tank and part of the roof of the production hall and had been localized. As a result of the fire, two plant workers were poisoned by combustion products. The company has not yet identified the cause of the fire, saying that it will be possible to determine it after the fire is completely extinguished. There is also no estimate of the damage or impact on the production itself. ZVS holding added that no explosives are used at the Snina plant. All the shell casings are filled at another facility in Dubnica nad Vahom, where the semi-state enterprise&apos;s main operation is located. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells. Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing &quot;desperately needed&quot; NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the &apos;second half&apos; of 2024 at the earliest. The Ukrainian government announced in September that Ukraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition. Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-breaks-out-at-slovak-factory-producing-artillery-shells-for-ukraine/	2024-10-29T12:42:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251756590.jpg

Who is Sergei Kiriyenko, Russian hawk reportedly in touch with Elon Musk?	Late last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, the U.S.-based oligarch with extensive influence on American politics, had been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022. The revelation came weeks after reports that similar calls were potentially made by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the current Republican Party nominee who is heavily backed by Musk. The former and potentially future U.S. president did not support nor accept the claim that he spoke to Putin after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both of these stories focused on the alleged direct line of communication between Putin allegedly and those who could influence the U.S. response to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war in Ukraine. However, they also mentioned several Russian characters that slipped from the public eye. One of Musk&#x2019;s alleged points of contact was a less-known Russian official, Sergei Kiriyenko, according to the WSJ. Unknown to the general public outside Russia, Kiriyenko, Putin&#x2019;s first deputy chief of staff, holds enormous sway over the Kremlin&#x2019;s war effort and its control of Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. He is also one of the clearest cases of how a Russian liberal morphed into a government-employed technocrat and later a pillar of President Putin&#x2019;s regime. Sergei Kiriyenko is no stranger to politics. He accepted his first government position in Russia&#x2019;s energy ministry in 1997, having previously headed the Norsi oil company in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod. Then, in 1998, Kiriyenko was promoted to Russian Prime Minister in a dramatic government shakeup. He was just 35 years old: the youngest prime minister in the country&#x2019;s history. At the time, Kiriyenko was heralded as a &#x201C;young reformer&#x201D; alongside politicians such as Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov &#x2014; someone who could tackle Russia&#x2019;s dire economic problems. But Kiriyenko&#x2019;s tenure was short-lived. Four months into his tenure, an ongoing economic crisis led to Russia failing to pay off its debt. He ultimately resigned in August 1998 after Russia declared a sovereign default. Yet, the former youngest prime minister with the shortest tenure in the country&#x2019;s history wasn&#x2019;t done with politics. He was a major supporter of liberal economic reforms. Kiriyenko continued to work closely with Nemtsov, founding a political party, the Union of Right Forces, to run in Russia&#x2019;s 1999 parliamentary elections. The group struggled to make an impact at the ballot box and less than a year later Kiriyenko ultimately accepted a series of posts from the newly-elected president &#x2013; Vladimir Putin. In May 2000, he was named Presidential Envoy to the Volga Federal District; five years later, he was appointed the head of Rosatom, Russia&#x2019;s Federal Atomic Energy Agency. These posts were far from the Moscow decision-making centers, to which Kiriyenko was close in the late 1990s. Yet, following Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the lives of two former allies, Kiriyenko and Nemtsov, took a drastic turn. Nemtsov, by then a vocal critic of Putin&#x2019;s regime, was assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. A year later, Kiriyenko became the first deputy head of Putin&#x2019;s administration. Mourners gather to place tributes at the site where Russian opposition leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov was killed on Bolshoi Moskvoretsky bridge near St. Basil Cathedral in central Moscow, Russia, on Feb. 28, 2015.

(Contributor/Getty Images)Dr. Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), describes Kiriyenko&apos;s rise &#x2014; and his ideological flexibility &#x2014; as typical for careerists in the late Soviet Union. She highlights Kiriyenko&#x2019;s willingness to serve as the first secretary of the Soviet regional Komsomol Committee even as the USSR was actively disintegrating. &#x201C;At the time, people who went into the system did not believe in Communist ideals, but they were and remain statists. They believed in serving the Russian state,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Such ambitious individuals typically were intent on making a career under any leadership regardless of specific ideals or values.&#x201D; From the early 1990s onwards, Kiriyenko has remained loyal to a tumultuous kaleidoscope of regimes, from Yeltsin&#x2019;s pro-Western government to Putin&#x2019;s revanchist state. It is this dedication to the state, rather than ideology, that is valuable to the Kremlin. Many such willing and politically malleable officials now sit at the top of Russia&#x2019;s power structure. It is not only ideological flexibility that has allowed Kiriyenko to flourish under a Putin government, but his ability to reinvent himself within the Kremlin&#x2019;s closed system. Kiriyenko&#x2019;s original tasks focused on elections and domestic policy. But as the Kremlin&#x2019;s attention has shifted, the now 62-year-old bureaucrat has also sought to broaden his domain. Kiriyenko has become a key figure in administering Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, leading the rollout of sham referendums. Independent Russian news outlet Meduza reported that Kiriyenko secured that post in a personal meeting with Putin himself, where he laid out his &#x201C;vision&#x201D; for newly occupied territories. Family ties are also expanding Kiriyenko&apos;s reach. Kiriyenko&#x2019;s son, Vladimir, was appointed CEO of Russian social media site VKontakte &#x2014; a company in turn controlled by the Russian state-owned Gazprombank &#x2014; in December 2021, at the age of 38. &#x201C;This demonstrates that Putin sees Kiriyenko as his reliable associate. Putin needs to find replacements from reliable cadres, and gradual inheritance of status is a natural feature of autocratic neo-patrimonial systems such as Putin&apos;s, which do not allow outsiders in,&#x201D; Snegovaya says. Kiriyenko has also reportedly played his own role in Russian digital policy. In September, the U.S. Justice Department publicly linked Kiriyenko to 30 internet domains that appeared to be legitimate American news sites but were instead created specifically to amplify Russian propaganda. Kiriyenko has been on the radar of Western officials for some time. If the WSJ findings are true, Musk&#x2019;s calls would link him to a man under U.S., EU, and U.K. sanctions.

(Jim Watson / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;Musk owns what is probably still the most influential social media platform in terms of reaching people who shape opinion on domestic and foreign policy,&#x201D; says Dr. Ruth Deyermond, a senior lecturer in Post-Soviet Security in the Department of War Studies at King&apos;s College London. &#x201C;The fact that the man who owns X may be in contact with Russian officials, including individuals who are linked to accounts pumping out disinformation on X, is extremely worrying.&#x201D; Kiriyenko&#x2019;s current reach across a variety of fields makes him one of the key bureaucrats in Putin&#x2019;s Russia. The control of occupied parts of Ukraine is one sphere where Kiriyenko has been able to make himself indispensable to the Kremlin. According to experts, attempting to influence U.S. policy toward Ukraine would be very much on Kiriyenko&#x2019;s radar. Meanwhile, Musk is a U.S. security contractor, working with the U.S. government in areas such as satellite launches. He supplies Starlink internet terminals to the Ukrainian army. Domestically, he is also heavily involved in the current contentious U.S. presidential race, and has shared his ideas on Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine &#x2014; views that many see as echoing those of Putin and his regime. &#x201C;(Occupied) Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Soviet leader Nikita) Khrushchev&#x2019;s mistake,&#x201D; Musk famously wrote as a proposal, repeating the Russian narrative that the occupied peninsula was Russian for the taking. &#x201C;For the Russian government, Musk gives a unique prize. He has a unique skill set for anyone who is interested in influencing those kinds of things (like U.S. defense policy or politics),&#x201D; Deyermond says. &#x201C;Getting Musk on side, persuading him or encouraging him to adopt their point of view and to act in ways that would benefit them, that would be a huge, huge success for the Russian government.&#x201D; Tesla CEO Elon Musk (R) joins former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a campaign rally at site of his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, U.S. on Oct. 5, 2024. (Jim Watson / /AFP via Getty Images)Ultimately, while alleged contact with a man such as Kiryenko &#xA0;&#x2014; a technocrat with no outspoken political beliefs, an individual generally happy to remain in the background &#x2014; may seem less sinister than meetings more vocal, hawkish Russian figures, the fluid, interconnected nature of Russia&#x2019;s authoritarian government means that any links could pose risks. &#x201C;Russia is an authoritarian state. You don&apos;t have to be in the Russian government to be operational on behalf of the Russian government. That&#x2019;s true in any authoritarian state, it&apos;s been particularly an issue in Russia,&#x201D; says Deyermond. &#x201C;(Allegedly,) Musk has been talking to people who are in the wider Kremlin circle and who have been seen to be operating in ways that benefit the Russian government. Even if it was unclear that these were pro-Kremlin individuals or Kremlin agents, (they are) in effect, extensions of Kremlin policy.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/who-is-sergei-kiriyenko-the-liberal-turned-russian-hawk-reportedly-in-touch-with-elon-musk/	2024-10-29T11:48:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-841559856.jpg
Ukraine facing 'grim' situation in Donetsk Oblast, as Russia claims capture of Selydove	Ukraine faces a &quot;pretty grim&quot; situation in Donetsk Oblast in the east of the country as Russian forces make some of their swiftest advances since the summer of 2022, according to experts and OSINT analysts. &quot;The last week has been extremely difficult for the Ukrainians &#x2014; the Russians were able to breach the Ukrainian defenses in various areas,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with Kastehelmi saying Moscow&apos;s forces have advanced &quot;faster than it has been any time after the summer of 2022.&quot; &quot;So we&apos;re looking at really large movements on the front lines, especially when put into the context of this whole full-scale invasion,&quot; he added. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry on Oct. 29 claimed the capture of Selydove, a town close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. While Kyiv has yet to comment on the situation, experts and OSINT analysts have all but confirmed the town has fallen. The Deep State OSINT project map based on data from Oct. 28 showed most of Selydove under Russian control, with around a third depicted as a disputed gray zone. An analysis of Deep State data by the independent Russian news outlet Agentsvo said Russia had taken 196.1 square kilometers (75.7 square miles) during the week of Oct. 20-27. &quot;The Russian army has not had such a rapid weekly advance since at least the beginning of this year,&quot; it said in a post on Telegram. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending frontlines stretching from the country&#x2019;s northeast to southern regions, &#xA0;particularly in the far eastern Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. And the fall of Selydove would be dire news for Pokrovsk, lying only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest, towards which Russian forces have been inching for the past couple of months. &quot;The city of Selydove is now most likely totally lost,&quot; Kastehelmi said. &quot;There could be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost. &quot;That&#x2019;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; According to Kastehelmi, one of the biggest dangers now facing Ukrainian troops is that the positions they are now being forced to fall back to are not as heavily fortified as the positions they&apos;re withdrawing from.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Asked if he believed the situation could snowball, he said there&apos;s &quot;a real danger of that.&quot; This would depend on Russian forces having the resources and reserves to exploit potential gaps in the Ukrainian defenses, but Kastehelmi said there haven&apos;t been any signs of that so far. &quot;Even though the Russians have pushed 10 kilometers in a week, we still haven&apos;t seen something that by definition would be a breakthrough.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin still has a long way to go before achieving his stated goal of taking all of the Donbas, Ukraine&#x2019;s far eastern coal mining region. Russia currently occupies all of the Luhansk Oblast, and most of Donetsk Oblast except the last big remaining cities under Ukrainian control, including Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka to the north, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk further north, and Chasiv Yar to the east. Russia would have to take an additional 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) of territory to capture all of the Donbas, which, even at the current increased pace, would take just under a year. It&apos;s also not been without a heavy cost for Russian forces. Casualties over October may reach around 40,000, Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, said on Oct. 25. But with winter approaching, the uncertainty surrounding next week&apos;s U.S. presidential election and future American weaponry supplies, and Ukraine&apos;s army dealing with its own manpower and morale issues, it&apos;s an especially precarious time for Kyiv. &quot;This is a pretty grim situation for the Ukrainians,&quot; Kastehelmi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-facing-grim-situation-in-donetsk-oblast-as-russia-claims-capture-of-selydove/	2024-10-29T11:43:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158884934.jpg
Opinion: It’s time to admit the West is already at war with Russia	Another week of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has gone by, and Moscow has crossed yet another line with its aggression against Western targets. This time, the violation came in the form of a parcel bomb in the hold of a German aircraft. The device exploded on the ground at a logistics center tarmac rather than in mid-air due only to fortuitous delay. The head of German domestic intelligence told the Bundestag that if the plane had been airborne, it would have crashed. The United Kingdom suspects Russian involvement in a similar incident in July at a DHL depot in Birmingham. Of course, the attempted bombing of a DHL plane is hardly the first incident where Russia has targeted Western aircraft. A decade ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, two-thirds of whom were Dutch nationals. Russian proxies in Donetsk Oblast downed the civilian airliner with an anti-aircraft system supplied by Russia&#x2019;s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade on direct orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was also reported that North Korea is supplying half of the artillery shells Russia is using against Ukraine, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now sending as many as 10,000 soldiers to aid Putin&#x2019;s genocidal war. It&#x2019;s a match made in hell: Putin, fearful of unrest if he orders further mobilization, gains fresh bodies for wave assaults against Ukrainian positions, while Kim receives Russian technical know-how in exchange. Unsurprisingly, some North Korean soldiers deployed in Ukraine have already deserted. Forced into the fight, many likely have little will to sacrifice themselves in meat grinder assaults on the front line. However, expect Kim&#x2019;s soldiers to be prodded forward by Russian forces who will use the same brutality they employ on their own reticent troops. Much as in World War II, Russian blocking brigades mow down retreating soldiers.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s ever-deepening alliances with the world&#x2019;s autocrats and its continuous &#x201C;shadow war&#x201D; against the West are nothing new, yet they are a deeply concerning reality. It&#x2019;s time to admit what most already quietly know: we in the West are already at war with Russia. Yes, thankfully, not a direct full-scale war, but a war that is nonetheless active. If we fail to respond to Putin&#x2019;s ongoing aggression with strength and resolve, this simmering conflict may escalate into a more serious conflagration. German intelligence officials sounded a similar message, warning that &#x201C;direct military conflict with NATO (is) becoming an option for Russia,&#x201D; perhaps as soon as the end of the decade. Western weakness only encourages Russian aggression, and lately the signs are not encouraging. France just announced it will fall well short of its pledge to provide 3 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2024. The Biden administration, meanwhile, will remain wedded to its policy of restricting U.S.-supplied weapons from targeting sites on Russian territory, despite ample evidence that the exact opposite approach is needed. There are, however, glimmers of hope. Putin&#x2019;s need to rely on North Korean troops and to consistently sweeten the pot with larger sign-on bonuses underscores the scale of Russian losses and the challenges he faces in replacing them. Ukrainian officials, for their part, remain confident in their ability to recruit new soldiers, though they express concerns about adequately equipping them. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and Norway recently announced a new $1.5-billion aid package to Ukraine, which includes air defenses, tanks, combat drones, and artillery. A French project to develop kamikaze drones announced successful tests, with the first 100 units slated for delivery to Ukraine by year-end. South Korea is also reportedly considering direct military aid to Ukraine in response to Russia&#x2019;s use of North Korean troops on the front lines. The outcome of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and the broader shadow war against the U.S. and its allies remains in the balance. Much will depend on the next U.S. administration&#x2019;s policy decisions. While there are clear pitfalls for either candidate in terms of confronting Russia, the next president has an opportunity to marshal American resolve, and begin tackling an autocratic alliance run amok through a renewed investment in hard power &#x2014; investments that would pay dividends for decades to come. Europe, too, must do some soul searching: its pace of rebuilding defense capabilities and industrial strength is inadequate. The recent near-tragedy in European airspace should serve as a wake-up call for European leaders, whose countries and civilian populations are on the front line of Putin&#x2019;s shadow war. The longer Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine grinds on, the more brazen and reckless the shadow war will become. If Russia succeeds against Ukraine, formalizing into the Russian Federation what it has taken by force, and stymieing Ukraine&#x2019;s pathway to real security guarantees via NATO membership, Germany&#x2019;s warning of a hot war by 2030 may prove prescient. Staving off that future requires leaders in the West to say what we all already know; we are already at war with Russia. Ensuring this war does not expand is not an impossible task, but it will require steely resolve, and a realization that we are likely now astride a fulcrum of history.

German Rheinmetall plant in Ukraine is 'legitimate' target for Russia, Kremlin says	The new factory of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which opened in late October in Ukraine, is a &quot;legitimate&quot; target for Russian attacks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian pro-state news agency Ria Novosti on Oct. 29. The facility, which is already operating in Ukraine, is set to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles by the end of the year, according to Papperger. Rheinmetall provides weapons and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems. The company previously said it plans to open at least four production plants in Ukraine. The Kremlin&apos;s recent threats were not the first for Rheinmetall, and their facilities are well protected in Ukraine, Reuters reported, citing the company. According to Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger, the company intends to open a second plant in Ukraine &quot;in the near future,&quot; with the production of gunpowder, tank ammunition, and air defense systems in their sights.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-rheinmetall-plant-in-ukraine-is-legitimate-target-for-russia-kremlin-says/	2024-10-29T11:32:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/peskov.jpeg
Kharkiv’s historic skyscraper becomes the latest victim of Russia’s bombardments	Late on Oct. 28, a loud explosion rang out in the center of Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest city. Situated just over 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border, explosions have become part of daily life in Kharkiv as Russia continues to attack the city with drones, missiles, and aerial bombs. This time, the Russian bomb hit an iconic 13-story building situated in the very heart of the city, known as Derzhprom, or the State Industry House. Completed in 1928, Derzhprom was one of the first skyscrapers built in Eastern Europe and is internationally renowned for its constructivist design of reinforced concrete and glass. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in the Soviet Union. Preliminary evidence suggested that Russian forces used a FAB-500 aerial bomb fitted with a glide kit &#x2013; a 500-kilogram, high-explosive warhead designed to destroy targets like military headquarters, warehouses, and reinforced concrete structures &#x2013; to hit the nearly 100-year-old building. In 2017, Derzhprom was included in the preliminary list of UNESCO World Heritage, and after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, was placed under provisional enhanced UNESCO protection. The strike injured nine people, severely damaged Derzhprom&#x2019;s facade, and shattered dozens of windows, leaving the offices inside covered in a layer of dust and rubble. &#x201C;For people from Kharkiv, Derzhprom is like our Statue of Liberty, or Eiffel Tower, or Buckingham Palace,&#x201D; Viktoria Grivina, a PhD researcher on Kharkiv at the University of St Andrews and a Kharkiv local, told the Kyiv Independent. The building was constructed when Kharkiv was the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic &#x2013; a short-lived period between 1919 and 1934, after which the capital was moved to Kyiv. &#x201C;Even though it was a puppet state, among intellectual circles there was an aspiration that this new innovative construction would be part of a new Ukraine,&#x201D; Grivina said. The sprawling, 63-meter-high building was originally intended to house Soviet bureaucracy in the modern capital. The architecture reflects this sense of modernism with clean white lines and stark, futuristic glazing, echoing the contemporary Bauhaus art movement and architects like Le Corbusier. The Derzhprom building (also known as the State Industry Building or the Palace of Industry), an example of constructivist architecture, in Freedom Square, Kharkiv, Ukraine, Soviet Union, circa 1935. Completed in 1928 and designed by architects Sergei Serafimov, Samuil Kravets and Mark Felger, the building&apos;s name is a shortening of two words meaning &apos;State Industry.&apos; (General Photographic Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)People walk past the damaged Derzhprom building, a historic Soviet skyscraper, following a missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine on Oct. 29, 2024. (Ivan Samoilov /AFP via Getty Images)Derzhprom is not only a &#x201C;marvelous masterpiece of modern architecture, which still I would say can be compared to a lot of contemporary buildings in the world,&#x201D; but it&apos;s also &#x201C;a miracle of engineering,&#x201D; Jenia Gubkina, a Ukrainian architect and architectural historian from Kharkiv, who now teaches at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It was one of the main buildings of interwar modernism history, not only Soviet history or Ukrainian history, but world architectural history in the 20th century. You can open any book on the history of 20th-century architecture, and you will find a picture of Derzhprom.&#x201D; &#x201C;In Kharkiv, we are proud of this building as it&apos;s the result of the work of a lot of engineers, mathematicians, economists, politicians, and builders and constructors, not just architects,&#x201D; Gubkina said. Derzhprom&#x2019;s architects were Russian, but the workers perfecting this new reinforced concrete construction were locals, including the head engineer, Pavlo Rottert. &#x201C;So this is a certain point of pride,&#x201D; Grivina added. The motto &#x201C;Kharkiv is reinforced concrete&#x201D; came into prominence after February 2022, when Kharkiv resisted Russia&#x2019;s onslaught despite being so geographically close to the border. Derzhprom reflects the idea that people from Kharkiv are also built &#x201C;from this reinforced concrete, we are people of steel, which is not true, of course, because for us it is still a tremendous blow,&#x201D; Grivina added. The building was heavily damaged in World War II, with Nazi occupying forces attempting to destroy the building as they retreated in August 1943. The reinforced concrete building withstood the damage. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the building underwent years of restoration to restore its former glory. The building &#x201C;wasn&apos;t destroyed during World War II, and now Russians are trying to destroy it,&quot; Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of the Kharkiv regional police, told a Kyiv Independent reporter on the ground shortly after the strike. A woman cleans debris inside the damaged Derzhprom building, a historic Soviet skyscraper, following a missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine on Oct. 29, 2024. (Ivan Samoilov / AFP via Getty Images)Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov echoed this sentiment, commenting to reporters that &#x201C;not even (Adolf) Hitler was able to do what the Russians have done.&#x201D; Derzhprom is located on Svobody (Freedom) Square, one of the largest squares in Europe. On the other side of the square is the regional administration building, which was targeted in a Russian attack in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. The missile strike on the regional administration building on March 1, 2022, killed 29 people and, injured 35 others, and left much of the imposing building in rubble. The strike also damaged Derzhprom&apos;s windows. Part of the building was damaged in another attack on the city center in January 2024. The latest strike left the building more scarred than ever. Surveying the broken glass and rubble after the strike, the head of Derzhprom, Mykola Chekhunov, told Suspilne that the repairs to the windows would be tackled first. &#x201C;I love this building. It&apos;s offensive to the point of tears,&#x201D; he added. As of Oct. 16, UNESCO has verified damage to 457 cultural sites in Ukraine, including 231 of historical and/or artistic interest. UNESCO&#x2019;s list of damaged sites in Kharkiv includes the &#x201C;Slovo&#x201D; building, which was constructed in 1929, the Kharkiv Art Museum, the Kharkiv National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, as well as multiple churches, libraries, and historic apartment buildings. The attacks on cultural heritage are a repeated tactic of Russia&#x2019;s war and represent a tactic of genocide, Gubkina said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not only the killing of children, elderly people, or soldiers, not only the occupation of our land and expropriation of our assets but the destruction of our cultural heritage and built environment and immovable heritage.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t evacuate cultural sites. They are where they are, unfortunately.&#x201D; The lack of action by international organizations like UNESCO is also disappointing to Kharkiv&#x2019;s architectural community. Derzhprom is included on UNESCO&#x2019;s &#x201C;List of Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection,&#x201D; but according to Gubkina, &#x201C;nobody knows what this status actually means and what kind of specific protection.&#x201D; Both legally and physically, Derzhprom has no protection from Russian attacks. For now, Derzhprom is damaged but still standing. &#x201C;You cannot imagine New York without the Empire State Building, and you cannot imagine Kharkiv without Derzhprom,&#x201D; Grivna said.

EU to increase capacity to export electricity to Ukraine to 2.1 gigawatts ahead of winter	The Transmission System Operators of Continental Europe will increase their export capacity to Ukraine and Moldova by 400 megawatts (MW) to 2.1 gigawatts (GW) starting Dec. 1, according to a statement published on Oct. 29. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Russian missile and drone attacks have reportedly destroyed 9 GW worth of capacity on Ukraine&apos;s grid. The body said that the decision to increase the capacity for electricity exports was made in response to the destruction of numerous power plants in Ukraine and the expected electricity shortage during the coming winter. The new limit will take effect on Dec. 1, 2024, and operators will be able to review it monthly starting in March 2025. Ukraine will also have an additional 250 MW of guaranteed extra capacity in emergency mode from the European Union, according to the Energy Ministry. National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 15 that Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during the autumn and winter months. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-increase-capacity-to-export-electricity-to-ukraine-to-2-1-gigawatts-ahead-of-winter/	2024-10-29T10:56:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1244728337.jpeg
160,000 people planned to be drafted into Ukrainian forces, NSDC Secretary says	A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian armed forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29 during a session of the Ukrainian parliament. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. According to Lytvynenko, 1,000,050 citizens have been drafted into the military so far since the beginning of martial law. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry. Nearly one million people were eligible for exemption in mid-August, according to the Defense Ministry. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early April that he ordered relevant ministries to introduce &quot;updated, more fair&quot; rules on exempting employees of &quot;critically important&quot; companies from military service. Employees in &quot;strategically important sectors of the economy&quot; will be able to extend their exemption from military conscription, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers announced on Oct. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/160-000-people-planned-to-be-drafted-into-ukrainian-forces-nsdc-secretary-says/	2024-10-29T09:51:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2082110119.jpg
Norway announces $127 million compensation for Romanian Patriot sent to Ukraine	Norway will allocate 1.4 billion kroner ($127.4 million) to boost Ukraine&apos;s air defense within the Nansen Support Programme, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Oct. 29. The funds will be used to buy a new Patriot system for Romania to replace the one it handed over to Ukraine on Oct. 3. Bucharest initially hesitated before deciding to donate one of its Patriots in June. The Romanian government issued an order for the system&apos;s delivery in September. &quot;Greater air defense has been one of Ukraine&apos;s most critical needs since the start of the war. Norway&apos;s support to Ukraine is based on what Ukraine needs most, and we will continue to provide support for as long as it is necessary,&quot; said Store. Store added that Norway and the Western allies must increase their support to Ukraine because air defense is one of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;most critical&quot; needs. &quot;Without adequate air defense equipment, Ukraine cannot protect the military installations and forces that are defending the country &#x2013; nor can the country provide protection to children and adults trying to carry on with their lives or safeguard the civilian infrastructure that is to provide electricity and heating throughout the winter.&quot; Norway had earlier given 4 billion kroner ($364 million) to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense, including the purchase of Patriot interceptor missiles, an IRIS-T battery, and the repair of existing air defense systems. Norway also donated a NASAMS system, and its instructors trained Ukrainian operators in using Western air defense systems. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each, but no announcement on their arrival has been made so far. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-provide-over-127-million-to-strengthen-ukraines-air-defense/	2024-10-29T09:03:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/776dd4b8cded16f53ab9b6fa5d1552c5_1730142122_extra_large.jpeg
Ukrainian parliament approves resignation of Prosecutor General Kostin	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on Oct. 29 to approve the resignation of Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said on his Telegram channel. Kostin&apos;s resignation was supported by 255 members of parliament, according to Honcharenko. The Ukrainian government has not yet decided on a replacement for Kostin. Potential candidates allegedly being considered as a replacement for Kostin include Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper and Kyiv Oblast Governor Ruslan Kravchenko, Olena Shcherban, a deputy executive director at the Kyiv-based NGO Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Kyiv Independent. The chief prosecutor submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) meeting headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The session addressed the &quot;immoral situation&quot; surrounding the fake disabilities of prosecutors, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. Following the meeting, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that his agency had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with crimes, while another nine suspects had been convicted. Medical examination commissions (MSEK) are bodies tasked with determining the severity of a disability. Corruption schemes at medical examination commissions linked to draft evasion have been reported in Rivne, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kharkiv oblasts. Kostin has served as prosecutor general since July 28, 2022, replacing Iryna Venediktova. Prior to that, he was a member of parliament from 2019 to 2022 and headed the legal policy committee. From 2012 to 2019, Kostin was a deputy chairman of the Odesa Oblast Bar Association. He has been a member of the International Bar Association since 2000.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-approves-resignation-of-prosecutor-general-kostin/	2024-10-29T07:38:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168105950.jpg
Zelensky asked US for Tomahawk missiles as part of victory plan's secret part, NYT reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for Tomahawk missiles from the U.S. as part of the &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; in his victory plan, the New York Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan comprises five points with three classified parts. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, a part of which is classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression, a part of which would consist of receiving Tomahawk missiles, according to the Times&#x2019; report. Tomahawk missiles have a range of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), seven times the range of the long-range missile systems called ATACMS that Ukraine received from the U.S. According to the officials, Ukraine did not manage to convince Western diplomats why it needed Tomahawks. The number of Ukraine&#x2019;s targets in Russia also allegedly far exceeds the stockpiles the U.S. could hand over without jeopardizing its interests in the Middle East and Asia. The outlet also cites four U.S. officials who claimed Zelensky was surprised that U.S. President Joe Biden did not grant him permission to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia when they met in Washington in September. This was confirmed by Zelensky&apos;s office.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-asked-us-for-tomahawk-missiles-as-part-of-victory-plans-secret-part-nyt-reports/	2024-10-29T06:58:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Russia claims capture of Selydove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 29 that its forces had captured the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, which lies close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. Observers and the Ukrainian military have warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. While Kyiv did not confirm whether Russia captured the town, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;There can be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost,&quot; said Emil Kastehelmi, a military expert and open-source intelligence (OSINT) analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &quot;That&apos;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; The town&apos;s fall would spell dire news for Pokrovsk, lying only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, with their push in Donetsk Oblast recently gaining a long-unseen pace.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-capturing-selydove-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2024-10-29T06:34:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569068.jpg
Drone strike on Chechnya possibly launched from Dagestan, Ingushetia, source claims	A drone strike that damaged the Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes on Oct. 29 may have been launched from Russia&apos;s neighboring North Caucasus republics, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The drone attack hit Chechnya early in the morning, marking the first such instance during the war. Footage shared on social media showed significant damage and a fire at the university building, but no casualties were reported. The source&apos;s statement would indicate that the attack was not one of Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes against Russian territory but a result of a local feud. One of the most likely versions explaining the attack links it to the deadly shooting in the Moscow office of the retailer Wildberries in September and a conflict between Kadyrov and lawmakers from the neighboring Caucasus republics, the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Chechen strongman accused Bekhan Barakhoyev, Suleiman Kerimov, and Rizvan Kurbanov from Dagestan and Ingushetia of plotting to kill him and warned he would call for a &quot;blood feud&quot; if they did not prove their innocence. The accusation was related to the Wildberries shooting, which broke out when Vladislav Bakalchuk, the estranged husband of the company&apos;s founder, tried to &quot;illegally&quot; enter the building with his security guards. Several of those involved come from the North Caucasus, including two killed security guards from Ingushetia. Kadyrov has previously said that he supports Vladislav Bakalchuk&apos;s effort to stop the planned merger of Wildberries with another company. Kadyrov did make no specific accusations when reporting on the drone strike in the morning, adding that an investigation is underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/chechnya-drone-strike-source/	2024-10-29T06:16:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151325824.jpg
Explosions reported in occupied Luhansk, Ukrainian official suggests ammunition depots hit	Smoke and explosions were recorded in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk on Oct. 29 after what Governor Artem Lysohor called possible strikes on Russian ammunition depots. &quot;Since morning, locals have been sharing footage of detonating ammunition,&quot; Lysohor said, publishing videos recorded by civilians and bystanders on his Telegram channel. Russia has occupied the city of Luhansk, Ukraine&apos;s easternmost regional center, since the start of its aggression in 2014. The videos show thick smoke rising above Luhansk and an explosion. According to Lysohor, Russian forces closed a park in the city where ammunition was stored, which would mean that Russian forces hid materiel in public spaces frequented by civilians. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show a smoke rising over Russian-occupied Luhansk, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine, after a Ukrainian strike on Oct. 29, 2024. (Governor Artem Lysohor/Telegram)&quot;Today&apos;s explosions will clearly be reflected in front-line combat operations: it will take a lot of time to replenish warehouses and build new logistics routes,&quot; Lysohor wrote. Russian occupation authorities claimed that Ukraine carried out an &quot;unsuccessful missile attack&quot; on Luhansk, using weaponry of an unknown type. Air defenses intercepted the missiles, with some of them exploding in the industrial part of the city, damaging several buildings, Russian proxies and state media alleged. No casualties were reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian forces have been destroying ammunition behind the front lines to slow Russia&#x2019;s advance along the front line, as Moscow&#x2019;s forces advance at a speed not seen since March 2022. In recent months, the Ukrainian military struck ammunition depots in Russia&#x2019;s Voronezh Oblast, near occupied Mariupol, and Toropets in Russia&#x2019;s Tver Oblast, with the latter&#x2019;s explosion picked up on earthquake monitors.	https://kyivindependent.com/luhansk-explosions/	2024-10-29T05:32:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Luhansk-Oct-29.png
Trump's reported plan to 'freeze' Russia's war 'unrealistic,' Ukrainian lawmaker says	A plan reportedly being considered by Donald Trump to freeze Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion if he becomes president is &quot;unrealistic,&quot; a Ukrainian lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, said that upon taking office, Trump would soon have to &quot;face reality,&quot; and any such plan would fail in light of political realities. &quot;This plan doesn&#x2019;t look realistic because it implies the agreement of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who is absolutely unreliable and not trustworthy when it comes to observing any agreements,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, Putin, as of now, is not interested in negotiations and agreements. He still believes that he can win.&quot; Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to a report in the Financial Times (FT) on Oct. 28. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or U.N. peacekeepers, will have to keep order. Merezhko, a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People Party, said the &quot;only solution&quot; to ending the war is to &quot;strengthen Ukraine and thereby force Putin to sit at the table of negotiations.&quot; &quot;In my opinion, the only realistic plan is the &apos;Victory Plan&apos; put forward by President Zelensky.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-plan-to-freeze-russias-war-unrealistic-ukrainian-lawmaker-says/	2024-10-29T04:53:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg
Opinion: If elections were held today, Poland's pro-democracy coalition could fall	One year after a coalition led by Donald Tusk defeated Poland&#x2019;s right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), the mood in the country is subdued. While a victory by pro-democracy parties in a free, but decidedly unfair, election was necessary, it was not sufficient to eliminate the illiberal populist threat. Prying PiS&#x2019;s tentacles out of every nook and cranny of the state is proving to be a much longer process. In the meantime, PiS is seeking political advantage from the opposition benches. Were another election to be held today, an estimated 47-48% of eligible voters would go to the polls, which would be one of the lowest turnouts in the last 20 years, and far lower than the record 75% turnout last year. Such findings stand in stark contrast to those of a year ago, when young people voted in droves, particularly young women, and proved to be the decisive factor in PiS&#x2019;s defeat. Almost nothing is left of this previous mobilization. Half of those recently surveyed (51%) identify fairly or very little with the government&#x2019;s program and message. Worse, PiS has retained its support, and support for the far-right Confederation alliance has doubled over the past year. Many Poles still remember that PiS oversaw a wide range of financial transfers, including large child-support and pension payments. A fresh election, according to current polls, would probably replace Tusk&#x2019;s government (which has around 28% support) with a coalition of PiS (30%) and the Confederation (15%). Around 31% of Poles who intend to vote in the next election would choose differently than they did last year. Even more important than any snapshot are the broader trend lines, which increasingly favor the Confederation and disfavor two parties in Tusk&#x2019;s coalition: the Left and Third Way. Although Tusk&#x2019;s Civic Coalition has gained a strong base of voters, the Confederation&#x2019;s gains have been bigger. While 61% of those voting for the Confederation in 2023 want to do so again (and 59% for PiS), only half of Civic Coalition and Left voters are willing to double down on their choice. Supporters of the Left and Third Way are the most disappointed in the results of their victory a year ago. For example, typical supporters of the Left are dismayed that the government has merely introduced administrative changes to decriminalize abortion, rather than legalizing it. This issue matters, because it has become a key indicator of whether Poland is advancing as a modern country or returning to its benighted Catholic past. It doesn&#x2019;t help that the co-ruling Left is dominated by men, despite relying on a predominantly female electoral base.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Other segments of the Civic Coalition&#x2019;s electorate are disappointed by the lack of progress in restoring the rule of law and holding PiS politicians accountable for abuse of power. Most of these efforts have been blocked by the PiS-linked president, Andrzej Duda. Moreover, the state&#x2019;s dwindling coffers make it difficult to offer any quick material benefits to Polish voters, as PiS did. Third Way, for its part, is experiencing a crisis of both engagement and leadership, and it comprises two parties that ultimately are incompatible: Sejm Speaker Szymon Ho&#x142;ownia&#x2019;s Poland 2050 party and Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Kosiniak-Kamysz&#x2019;s conservative Polish People&#x2019;s Party. Each is threatened not only by demobilization of their traditional voters, but also by Tusk&#x2019;s party, Civic Platform, and the Confederation. The Confederation&#x2019;s leader, Krzysztof Bosak, is increasingly popular across many segments of the electorate, commanding the support of half of all men under 40. The party did, however, make a serious mistake by nominating S&#x142;awomir Mentzen as its candidate for the presidential election next year. As a party leader, he is popular with the rank and file, but not with the broader public. Unlike PiS, the Confederation has the potential to attract disillusioned voters from almost any party. It offers a more honest version of right-wing conservatism than PiS does, and it is unencumbered by the former ruling party&#x2019;s innumerable scandals. Some two-thirds of those recently surveyed, including one-third of PiS voters, believe that at least some PiS politicians or officials deserve to be in prison. Among the top names on the list are former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki (who 34% think should be prosecuted); PiS&#x2019;s longtime leader, Jaros&#x142;aw Kaczy&#x144;ski (30%); and former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro (19%). But Tusk is not blind to the threat that the Confederation poses. His new immigration policy &#x2014; which temporarily prohibits asylum in Poland for applicants from Russia and Belarus &#x2014; is meant to head off the far right. Moreover, a happy ending to the story remains possible. The next presidential election must be held by May 18, 2025, and it could remove the biggest obstacle to the government&#x2019;s progress. The clear frontrunner is Warsaw Mayor Rafa&#x142; Trzaskowski of Civic Platform, who is polling at around 33%, whereas no other candidate exceeds 8%. His election would be the breakthrough that Tusk and the rest of Poland&#x2019;s pro-democracy coalition need. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Romania's Defense Ministry proposes downing drones violating its airspace	Romania could shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace based on the level of threat, according to a draft law published by the Romanian Defense on Oct. 28. Bucharest reported numerous cases of Russian drones crashing on its territory or violating its airspace near the Ukrainian border following mass strikes on Ukraine. According to the proposed legislation, the Romanian military would be able to intercept and, when necessary, destroy piloted and unmanned aircraft breaching its airspace under certain circumstances. The document must be approved by the Romanian government and the parliament. Depending on the level of threat, &quot;unauthorized&quot; drones may be disabled or taken control of with &quot;non-kinetic&quot; means or shot down. The interception of a piloted aircraft would follow several steps, including establishing radio contact, transmitting instructions to the pilot, and firing a warning shot. The use of &quot;destructive force&quot; by aircraft or ground-based air defenses would be the last resort. The Romanian military would attempt to shoot down the aircraft only after establishing all the circumstances and the level of threat and taking into account international law and the safety of people&apos;s lives and property, the document says. Allied forces stationed in Romania would be permitted to take part in the operations. Romania has urged NATO partners to present a &quot;robust and coordinated&quot; response to Russian missiles and drones violating the allied airspace. Latvia and Poland also reported similar breaches. Ukraine has urged NATO to intercept Russian drones and missiles over Ukrainian airspace both to protect Ukraine and their own countries. No country has committed to that step so far nor intercepted Russian projectiles in its airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanias-defense-ministry-proposes-downing-drones-violating-its-airspace/	2024-10-29T04:32:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1815112106.jpg
Orban lauds Georgia's ruling party for not allowing country to become 'second Ukraine'	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party for their disputed electoral victory and for not allowing Georgia to become &quot;a second Ukraine&quot; during his visit to Tbilisi on Oct. 29. &quot;I would like to congratulate you on the fact that, in the context of the desire for European integration, you have not allowed your country to be turned into a second Ukraine,&quot; Orban said at a press briefing with his Georgian counterpart, Irakli Kobakhidze. His words echoed the ruling Georgian Dream party campaign slogan as the &quot;party of peace,&quot; presenting the devastation of Ukrainian cities caused by the invading Russian forces as something that they could avoid by cozying up to Moscow. The ruling party also sought to cast the pro-European opposition&apos;s possible victory as a route to war with Russia. Moscow waged war against Georgia in 2008 and continues to occupy two Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Orban was among the first leaders to fly to Tbilisi to congratulate, despite international observers, opposition politicians, and the country&apos;s president all crying foul, accusing the ruling party of rigging the vote. Although some exit polls indicated that the pro-European opposition coalition would win the Oct. 26 parliament elections, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 54.08%, while four pro-European opposition groups won only 37.58%. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to acknowledge the results, while the U.S. and the EU called for an investigation after reports of intimidation and irregularities during the election process. Orban&apos;s convoy was booed as he arrived at his hotel while thousands of Georgians took to the streets of downtown Tbilisi to protest the result. The Hungarian prime minister is one of the closest European allies of the Georgian Dream and a vocal critic of the aid for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-in-georgia/	2024-10-29T03:39:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181050787.jpg
3,000 North Korean troops sent to Russian training grounds near front, Zelensky tells South Korean president	President Volodymyr Zelensky held a phone call with his South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol on Oct. 29 to discuss the transfer of North Korean troops to Russia and a response by Kyiv and Seoul. Pyongyang has reportedly dispatched thousands of troops to aid Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine in a sign of deepening Russian-North Korean cooperation. &#xA0; &quot;I provided my colleague with fresh data on 3,000 North Korean troops transferred to training facilities in the immediate vicinity of the combat zone,&quot; Zelensky said, according to his Telegram channel. This number is expected to rise approximately to 12,000, Zelensky noted, reiterating the figure previously provided by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency. Following a meeting with South Korean officials, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive. South Korean intelligence said that North Korean troops are likely heading for a front-line deployment, though the Ukrainian military has not yet confirmed encountering Pyongyang&apos;s forces on the battlefield. During the phone call, Zelensky and Yoon agreed to &quot;strengthen the sharing of intelligence and expertise and to intensify contacts on all levels, including on the highest level, to develop a response strategy and a list of countermeasures,&quot; the Ukrainian president said. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine later this week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss mutual cooperation, Yoon said on Oct. 28. A Ukrainian delegation will also visit South Korea, Zelensky revealed. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Zelensky also invited South Korea to join the G7 declaration made in Vilnius last year, based on which dozens of countries signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-with-yoon/	2024-10-29T03:01:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 49 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured at least 49 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 29. Russia launched 48 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 26 across various regions, the Air Force said. Russia attacked Kharkiv&apos;s Osnovyanskyi district with a Grom-E1 hybrid missile overnight on Oct. 29, killing at least four people and injuring two, local authorities reported. Two women and two men were killed in the attack, which also destroyed one house and damaged 19 others, along with four cars, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Emergency Service reported. A Russian FAB-500 bomb struck downtown Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 28, damaging the landmark Derzhprom building and injuring nine people. Russia also attacked Kyiv with drones overnight on Oct. 29, injuring six people, authorities reported. One of the victims was hospitalized with a serious leg injury. Debris from a Russian drone hit a nine-story apartment building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district in the early hours of Oct. 29, depressurizing a gas pipe, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. A fire spread to a nearby shop and cars, and the gas supply was shut off. Another Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late on Oct. 28 killed a 39-year-old man and injured 14 people. A civilian died in Myrnohrad, and two were injured in Rozdolne due to Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two civilians were killed and 16 were injured in Russian attacks, including two children. Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, an administrative building, a library, a post office, and residential areas, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-2/	2024-10-29T02:36:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kyiv-Oct-29.jpg
North Korean troops possibly heading to front lines, language barrier causing problems, says South Korea	North Korean troops deployed to Russia may be headed to the front lines, South Korean officials said on Oct. 29 after a briefing by Seoul&apos;s intelligence agency. Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun did not say when they would likely arrive on the battlefield and said Pyongyong and Moscow&apos;s troops were being hindered by a language barrier. &quot;The Russian military was teaching the North Korean military some 100 Russian military terms such as &apos;back to your position,&apos; &apos;fire&apos; and &apos;launch&apos;... but the North Korean military was struggling (to understand),&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. The assessment comes shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 28, the Yonhap news agency reported. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon said. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned earlier this month that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korean-intelligence/	2024-10-29T02:02:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340621.jpg
Chechnya hit by drone strike for first time, special forces university damaged, reports suggest	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone attack targeted Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic of Chechnya on Oct. 29 for the first time during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, according to claims by dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and media reports. The drone strike hit the building of the Russian Special Forces University named after Vladimir Putin in the city of Gudermes, the independent news outlet Agentstvo reported. Footage shared on social media shows significant damage to the building and a strong fire. Kadyrov claimed that the strike, which took place at 6:30 a.m. local time, merely hit the roof of the university&apos;s empty building, starting a fire but causing no casualties. The fire had been extinguished, the dictator said.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-strike-chechnya/	2024-10-29T01:21:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Baza-Chechnya-2.jpg

Yoon&apos;s comments come shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. &quot;I hope that under Secretary General Rutte&apos;s leadership, NATO will redouble efforts to monitor and block illegal exchanges between Russia and North Korea in solidarity and coordination,&quot; Yoon said. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Yoon added that the South Korean delegation will brief the EU Political and Security Committee on Oct. 29, after which they will travel to Ukraine to meet with intelligence and defense officials to exchange battlefield information and explore cooperation measures. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon commented.

Zelensky says he 'didn't hear Trump say he would reduce support for Ukraine'	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 28 that he had never heard U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump say he would cut aid for Ukraine, adding that the Republican nominee &quot;talks a lot.&quot; Speaking at a press conference in Reykjavik, Zelensky said that Ukraine &quot;understands all the risks,&quot; including a possible change in U.S. policy, and is preparing a plan to strengthen the country internally. The president nevertheless added he would still aim to retain the bipartisan support of the U.S. Congress. The comments came only one week before the U.S. presidential election, where Trump will face the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. The vote is expected to have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine. Responding to a question on the risk of a Trump presidency cutting aid to Ukraine, Zelensky replied, &quot;Trump talks a lot, but I didn&apos;t hear him say he would reduce support for Ukraine.&quot; Though often evasive on the topic of the aid for Ukraine, Trump frequently touts his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail and has blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and Zelensky for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion while failing to mention Putin. &quot;Not supporting Ukraine, I believe, will be a great victory for Putin and a loss for the West, democracy, and freedom,&quot; Zelensky said, suggesting that Trump would not want to lose to Putin. The former U.S. president has repeatedly claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. A recent article by the Financial Times (FT) claims that Trump aims to effectively freeze the war and reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in the foreseeable future, at least &quot;until Putin leaves the stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-ukraine/	2024-10-29T00:34:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg

Russian drone attack damages apartment building in Kyiv, injuring 2	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Kyiv with drones overnight on Oct. 29, damaging a residential building and injuring two people, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. One of the two victims was hospitalized, Klitschko said. The other was treated for her injuries on site. Debris from a Russian drone hit an apartment building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district in the early hours of Oct. 29, causing a fire. Nearby cars and a commercial building also caught fire following the attack, according to Klitschko. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said that emergency gas services had been dispatched to the attack site due to the risk of depressurization of the gas system. Russia has intensified aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s densely populated cities.

Sweden to allocate over $68 million in military aid to Ukraine	Sweden will allocate 729 million Swedish krona (approximately $68 million) in military aid to Ukraine, Stockholm announced on Oct. 28. The announcement came as the leaders of several Nordic countries convened in Iceland for the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit, during which President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with the prime ministers of Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. Of the total $68 million, about $46.5 million will go towards initiatives supporting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the Swedish government said. Another $21.6 million will support the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. The first portion of the funds may be directed towards a number of coalitions established to support Ukraine&apos;s military, including those dedicated to fighter jets, maritime security, mine clearance, and IT. The remaining $21.6 million is allocated for defense industry development under the &quot;Danish model,&quot;a mechanism based on a Danish-Ukrainian agreement that donates arms to Kyiv via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry. Ukraine produced 18 Bohdana howitzers earlier this year via financing from the Danish model. Sweden officially joined NATO in March 2024 after a lengthy application process triggered by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Upon entering the alliance, Sweden was immediately vocal in its calls for other member states to do more to support Kyiv. The Swedish government announced in May that it plans to allocate 75 billion Swedish krona ($7 billion) in military support to Ukraine from 2024 to 2026. Sweden on Sept. 9 announced a package worth $443 million that included combat boats, anti-tank weapons, ammunition, and Gripen jet spare parts. The Swedish Defense Ministry said at the time that transferring Gripen jets to Ukraine is currently &quot;not a viable option, as it would interfere with the prioritized introduction of F-16 fighters,&quot; but that Stockholm is continuing its efforts to establish the conditions to send Gripen jets to Kyiv in the future.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-allocate-over-68-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2024-10-28T19:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/sweden.jpeg
Norway's PM announces new 500-million-euro aid package for Ukraine	Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Oct. 28 that Norway will provide Ukraine with a new 500-million-euro ($543 million) aid package, allocating over half for military assistance. Several Nordic countries, including Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, have agreed to provide defense support to Ukraine, including weapons production, assistance in preparing for winter, shelter construction, and support for the victory plan. The Nordic countries have provided Ukraine with more than 20 billion euros ($21 billion) in military, financial, and humanitarian support since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Norway&apos;s Store noted that Northern European leaders received a clear assessment of the front-line situation during their meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the fourth Ukraine-Nordic Summit. &quot;The Nordic countries will continue to seek new avenues for supporting Ukraine and its people, while it continues to fight off Russia&apos;s aggression,&quot; reads the joint statement released at the Nordic Summit in Reykjavik on Oct. 28. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norways-pm-announces-new-500-million-euro-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-10-28T17:40:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/776dd4b8cded16f53ab9b6fa5d1552c5_1730142122_extra_large.jpeg
1 killed, 12 injured in Russia's attack on Kryvyi Rih	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Casualties from the Russian missile attack on residential buildings and medical facility in Kryvyi Rih late on Oct. 28 have increased to one dead and 12 injured, Ukrainian authorities report. A 39-year-old man died in the hospital following the attack, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Five people were rescued from the partially destroyed high-rise, according to the National Police. The attack destroyed 12 garages and ignited a fire spread across 500 square meters, affecting a residential building and several outbuildings. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-12-injured-in-russias-attack-on-kryvyi-rih/	2024-10-28T15:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-28-17_08_54.jpeg
Like Russian opposition itself, Navalny’s posthumous memoir falls short on Ukraine	For Russian liberals, late opposition leader Alexei Navalny represented a glimmer of hope for a democratic future. Yet for many Ukrainians, especially in the context of a decade of war, he was a more complex figure, often casting doubt on whether Russian opposition to Vladimir Putin necessarily aligned with support for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Navalny&#x2019;s memoir, &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; which he began writing in Germany after recovering from being poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent in 2020, and continued writing during his imprisonment by smuggling out the notebooks through his lawyers, was released posthumously in English translation on Oct. 22. Its publication has sparked a new wave of accolades for the former opposition leader, who died on Feb. 16 in one of Russia&#x2019;s most notorious penal colonies. &#xA0;His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has been on a major U.S. press tour, with pundits like Rachel Maddow already christening her as the new last hope for a democratic Russia. Navalny returned to Russia in January 2021 after his recovery from being poisoned. He was immediately arrested at the airport, and what followed was a Kafkaesque sequence of fabricated court cases levied against him, coupled with relentless efforts by the authorities to break his spirit. A photo of Alexei Navalny lies among flowers near the Wall of Grief monument in Moscow, Russia on Feb. 17, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)From prison, Navalny condemned the full-scale war against Ukraine and acknowledged it was unprovoked, directly challenging Putin&apos;s narrative that justifies the aggression through claims of NATO expansion and the need to protect Russia&#x2019;s &quot;sphere of influence.&quot; His disdain was particularly acute in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; when he wrote about how the Russian state-controlled media grotesquely distorted the truth about the Bucha Massacre and attempted to rewrite the tragedy as a fabricated event. At the same time, Navalny also used words like &#x201C;fratricidal&#x201D; to describe the war and wrote that &#x201C;the reasons for (it) are the political and economic problems within Russia, Putin&#x2019;s desire to hold on to power at any cost, and his obsession with his own historical legacy,&#x201D; which ultimately overlooks the genocidal intent behind it, such as the destruction of Ukrainian cultural sites, the forced relocation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, and &#x201C;re-education&#x201D; programs implemented by occupation authorities. Putin has repeatedly displayed how his tenuous grasp on historical events has influenced his motivation to launch a full-scale war against Ukraine, such as when he declared that Ukraine&#x2019;s claims to sovereignty are not legitimate because it was &#x201C;invented&#x201D; by the Bolsheviks. In his article &#x201C;On the historical unity of Ukrainians and Russians,&#x201D; which was published in 2021, Putin claimed that Ukrainians and Russians were &#x201C;one people, a single whole.&#x201D; For the Russian autocrat, his legacy lies in the forced reunification of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The war cannot be reduced merely to issues like politics and corruption, as Navalny would have had it. The 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are noticeably omitted from Navalny&#x2019;s reflections in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; on that year. While the former opposition leader mentioned the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in several passages, those sentences never included that it was taken from Ukraine, a stylistic choice that will no doubt perplex attentive readers familiar with his controversial statements from previous years, including &quot;Crimea is for those people who live in Crimea,&quot; and his quip that it was &quot;not a sandwich to be passed back and forth&quot; between the two countries. Admittedly, Navalny finally acknowledged from prison after the onset of the full-scale war that Ukraine&apos;s 1991 borders should be respected, which would mean the return of Crimea.

(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images)Navalny does not hesitate to criticize the Soviet system&#x2019;s failures, writing in his memoir that &#x201C;a state incapable of producing enough milk for its citizens does not deserve my nostalgia,&#x201D; a reference to the food shortages under Communist rule. He devotes multiple passages in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; to the poor handling of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster and the Soviet-Afghan War of 1979-1989, writing that both events &#x201C;dug the grave of the USSR.&#x201D; At the same time, the closest he comes to mentioning historical injustices committed against non-Russians during the Soviet period, including Ukrainians, is an anecdote from his childhood where he asked his Ukrainian grandmother why she hated Lenin so much. She told him how her family avoided deportation to Siberia, yet their wealth was stripped away with the implementation of collective farming. The iron roof on the family&#x2019;s house, which had supposedly been &#x201C;the envy of the whole village,&#x201D; was taken and sold off, the money &#x201C;spent on drink in the village council,&#x201D; according to family legend. &#x201C;I did not believe that bit at the time,&#x201D; Navalny wrote, &#x201C;but now I have no doubt it was true. Nevertheless, out of respect for my grandmother, I never discussed Lenin with her.&#x201D; Navalny also recalled being shocked as a young boy when his Ukrainian relatives found it funny to joke about spitting on Vladimir Lenin after a visiting cousin was brought to see the embalmed body of the Bolshevik leader in Moscow because they had been taught in Soviet times that he was &#x201C;sacrosanct.&#x201D; Overall, his memories of his childhood summers in Zalissia, a village located just two hours from Chornobyl in Kyiv Oblast, tempt Russian stereotypes of Ukrainians, like how his relatives would &#x201C;tut-tut about what a thin, pale Moscow townie (he) was and how they would have to fatten (him) up with good Ukrainian pork lard.&#x201D; When asked by his family after spending childhood summers with his Ukrainian relatives whether he identified more as Ukrainian or Russian, Navalny wrote that he always &#x201C;did (his) best to avoid a straight answer&#x201D; because such a question was &#x201C;like being asked who you loved more, your mother or father, to which there is no sensible answer possible.&#x201D; To a certain extent, this apolitical sentimentality appears to have carried over with him into his adulthood.

(Contributor/Getty Images)Tensions have been running high between Ukrainians and the Russian opposition over the past decade of Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. Nearly three years into the full-scale war, prominent figures like Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin &#x2014; who were released in a U.S.-initiated prisoner exchange with Russia over the summer &#x2014; continue to refer to it as &#x201C;Putin&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; a framing which many argue absolves the Russian people of their involvement in a conflict that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians and displaced millions. During a speech at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia in early September, Navalnaya also criticized those who renewed the push to &#x201C;decolonize&#x201D; Russia, saying that those who advocate for it &#x201C;can&#x2019;t explain why people with shared backgrounds and culture should be artificially divided.&#x201D; Such a statement is an oversight of the systematic discrimination and cultural marginalization that has existed for some of the more than 190 ethnic minorities that call Russia home. Interestingly enough, Navalny noted in his memoir that his wife &#x201C;holds even more radical views&#x201D; than him, although he did not elaborate in what sense. For the Russian opposition, it has been much easier to shine a light on issues like widespread corruption. In &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; Navalny argued that the Russian state&#x2019;s corruption, which has plunged so many of his fellow citizens into poverty, was one of the country&#x2019;s most deeply-rooted obstacles, preventing it from becoming &#x201C;a normal country, a rich one, governed by the rule of law.&#x201D; He went on to repeatedly emphasize throughout the book that &quot;the Russian people are good; it&#x2019;s our leaders who are appalling.&quot; Over the years, Navalny himself made repeated controversial statements that raised concerns among Ukrainians regarding how the Russian opposition viewed relations with Ukraine differently from Putin&#x2019;s regime. When the Orthodox Church of Ukraine was granted autocephaly in 2018, establishing it as an independent religious body from Moscow, Navalny expressed his dismay at the historic event, writing that &#x201C;the Russian Orthodox Church will lose up to half of its &#x2018;living&#x2019; parishes. What took centuries to build was destroyed by Putin and his fools in just four years. Putin is the enemy of the &#x2018;Russian world.&#x2019;&#x201D; The term &quot;Russian world&quot; promotes the idea that Russian-speaking individuals across the globe, regardless of their country of origin, are linked through cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds. While similar concepts exist within other imperial contexts, Russia&apos;s framing of the idea has assumed a distinctly militaristic character in recent years. This aggressive stance has jeopardized the sovereignty of not only Ukraine but also countries like Moldova and Georgia.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev / AFP via Getty Images)In &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; Navalny admitted that in the aftermath of the USSR&#x2019;s dissolution, he cared first and foremost about &#x201C;the plight of Russians,&#x201D; and criticized Putin&#x2019;s regime for preferring to &#x201C;talk endlessly about oppressed Russians (who live as minorities abroad following the dissolution of the countries that made up the USSR) while doing nothing to help them.&#x201D; He went on to advocate for the funding of Russian schools abroad to promote the spread of the Russian language and even &#x201C;resettling people back to their homeland.&#x201D; To what extent did Navalny&apos;s views on Ukraine-Russia relations evolve during his time in prison? The fact that he finally recognized Crimea as Ukraine, called for reparations to Ukraine after regime change in Russia, as well as an international investigation into Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine was promising. But would he have viewed Ukrainians&#x2019; reembrace of their language, culture, and history as a threat to the prosperity of the so-called &#x201C;Russian world&#x201D;? His condemnation of the full-scale war and concern with the economic prosperity of Russia suggest that if he had somehow defied all odds and been able to form a political movement strong enough to overthrow Putin&#x2019;s regime, our current reality could have been avoided. Yet, considering that he was worried about &#x201C;the plight of Russians&#x201D; and described both countries as &#x201C;fraternal,&#x201D; it seems that tensions between the two would have undeniably taken a different shape. Bearing all this in mind, one of the most jarring and disappointing aspects of the memoir is the use of Russian transliteration for Ukrainian locations. Kyiv is rendered as &quot;Kiev,&quot; Chornobyl as &quot;Chernobyl,&quot; and Zalissia as &quot;Zalisiye,&quot; which feels not only outdated but careless. This lapse falls on the translators, Arch Tait and Stephen Dalziel, but even more so on Alfred A. Knopf, a subsidiary of Penguin, for allowing such a glaring oversight to remain in the final publication. The potential trajectory of Navalny&#x2019;s evolving thoughts on Ukraine-Russia relations will forever remain speculative. Regardless of any valid criticism leveled against him, Navalny should not have faced imprisonment, poisoning, or death in custody. In a better world, political opposition would be allowed to flourish in Russia, fostering a healthy democratic environment. His life&#x2019;s work is proof that despite the insurmountable odds faced by those living in an authoritarian state, it is never too late to try and fight for a better future. The fact that he was able to smuggle out the end passages of this book through his lawyers and, in that sense, remain defiant of Putin to the very end, is admirable. The one-year anniversary of Navalny&#x2019;s death is approaching, and the remaining figureheads of the Russian opposition are all in exile, engaged in spats with one another, and lacking a clear strategy to take on Putin. They condemn the war, yet many still hesitate to address the question of collective guilt. The decade-long war of aggression against Ukraine stands as Russian society&#x2019;s greatest moral failure &#x2013; the more than 145,000 war crimes under investigation by Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office are proof of that. If there is to be hope for a democratic Russia, it must begin with the acknowledgment from those who will continue Navalny&#x2019;s work that Ukraine&#x2019;s military victory over Russia is the key to any democratic future for their country. However, Navalny&#x2019;s widow recently said in an interview with German media that it was &#x201C;hard to say&#x201D; whether it&#x2019;s right to arm Ukraine because &#x201C;the bombs also hit Russians.&#x201D; Many of the remaining members of the opposition cannot even move past calling it &quot;Putin&apos;s war,&quot; and the prospect of such change remains difficult to envision.

Opinion: There’s more to Ukraine than Hollywood gangster tropes and war	I recently watched a YouTube video of a Ukrainian performance on &#x201C;America&#x2019;s Got Talent.&#x201D; A friend sent me the link, promising it would amaze me &#x2013; and it did. You can find the video by searching &#x201C;Amazing holographic 4D cube show AGT.&#x201D; However, when the show&#x2019;s host, Howie Mandel, said, &#x201C;America&#x2019;s got love for the Ukraine,&#x201D; I cringed. The phrase &#x201C;the Ukraine&#x201D; implies it&#x2019;s a territory, not a sovereign country. It&#x2019;s just Ukraine &#x2013; the largest country in Europe, an important nation in its own right, and sadly, a place the world still knows too little about. Ukraine is often branded as a place of corruption and gangsters, and Hollywood doesn&#x2019;t help when it makes the villains Ukrainian. After living in Kyiv for years, I&#x2019;ve experienced something very different. The country I know is filled with talented, hardworking, and warm people who possess an incredible sense of humor. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, too many people think Ukraine is nothing but a war zone. I recently heard Mstyslav Chernov, the director of the Oscar-winning documentary &#x201C;20 Days in Mariupol,&#x201D; say that Americans often ask, &#x201C;Is there more to Ukraine than the war?&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve had similar frustrating conversations abroad, with people asking, &#x201C;Is that war still going on?&#x201D; Before the pandemic, I hosted many foreigners visiting Kyiv, often to explore IT opportunities. Questions like &#x201C;Is it safe there?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do they have the internet?&#x201D; were common. Even more surprising are comments from the Ukrainian diaspora. In Canada, home to the largest Ukrainian community outside of Ukraine, some people who left decades ago have no idea how their country has advanced. &#x201C;They have shopping malls in Kyiv?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do they have electric cars?&#x201D; Yes, Ukraine faces challenges, and many people live on modest salaries. But there is a growing middle class, and the big cities capture imaginations. Every guest I hosted in Kyiv was blown away.

(Lynsey Addario/Getty Images)People hang out at a bar in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 26, 2023. (Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)One misconception that always made me giggle is when people ask, &#x201C;What will we eat there?&#x201D; The food scene in Kyiv is incredible. There&#x2019;s been an explosion of amazing restaurants, and dining out here can compete with New York or London any day. Even during the war, new places are opening, and the food is phenomenal. If you want to have a laugh, &#xA0;stand-up comedy clubs are popular &#x2013; even in English. Where there&#x2019;s laughter, there&#x2019;s hope. I had a friend from California visit twice, and when he returned to Los Angeles, people teased him, asking if he&#x2019;d visited the land of Borat. He said Ukrainians are just like people in California &#x2013; trying to build businesses, raise families, and live their lives. That&#x2019;s the thing: Ukraine is not some backward nation that craves war. Before the full-scale invasion, Kyiv was on track to become Europe&#x2019;s next hotspot, and I&#x2019;d have bet anything on that happening. This brutal war has set everything back. Ukraine is not about war. It&#x2019;s about modernity, freedom, and new culture. It&#x2019;s a country brimming with energy. Ukraine has suffered from a poor reputation for as long as I can remember. I first discovered Kyiv nearly 17 years ago, and I&#x2019;ve been saying ever since that Ukraine needs to work on its brand. Of course, now that we&#x2019;re in the third year of the full-scale invasion, things are different. Air raid sirens can go off at any time, and it can be scary when Ukrainian air defenses shoot down drones and missiles. During those moments, you head to the bomb shelter. But life continues. One of the biggest misconceptions about Ukraine is that everyone here is poor and miserable. Most people don&#x2019;t have easy lives, and yes, poverty exists, but that&#x2019;s true in many places. I&#x2019;m originally from South Africa, where poverty exists on a different scale. In Ukraine, no one lives in shantytowns. When millions of Ukrainians fled across the borders, the European host nations were often surprised to see modern cars, fashionable clothes, and the latest smartphones. It&#x2019;s a high-tech nation, and the level of online convenience here would surprise any foreigner. There&#x2019;s also a wave of innovation happening. Ukraine is poised to become a global leader in military drone technology. Artists are creating, entrepreneurs are developing cool tech, new restaurants are opening, and foreign investors are exploring opportunities. Ukraine is a miracle. Even as hypersonic missiles and kamikaze drones rain down across the country, many have decided to stay, continuing their lives, albeit in a very different way. The economy needs to keep running. Life needs to go on to keep the wheels turning. Many passionate, dedicated people are working on projects to benefit and support Ukraine. Some have been involved long before the full-scale invasion, driven by a deep belief in the country and its people. Since 2018, I&#x2019;ve been part of a team of artists &#x2014; Ukrainian and international &#x2014; creating a storytelling film project that captures life in modern Kyiv. &#x201C;We Are Ukraine&#x201D; is a story about extraordinary people in an extraordinary time &#x2014; people who have chosen to continue to work, live, get married, have children, and laugh, against all odds. It&#x2019;s not a war story, a story about death and demise. It&#x2019;s a story about life, a love letter to Kyiv, which shows us what the world would miss out on if Kyiv would cease to exist. Freedom, independence, and identity are the culmination of modern humanity, forged over centuries through struggle, creativity, and resilience. Everything else in civil society flows from these values. Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine is a global wake-up call &#x2013; a reminder that these values must be nurtured and protected. Ukrainians are showing that not only can they defend these values, but by continuing to live, laugh, and love, they are defying those who seek to destroy them.

Ukraine war latest: US won't impose new limitations on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea enters war, Pentagon says	Key developments on Oct. 28: The United States will not introduce new restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American weapons if North Korean troops engage in combat, the Pentagon said on Oct. 28 following NATO&apos;s confirmation of North Korean troops&apos; deployment to Kursk Oblast. &quot;A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,&quot; said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, Reuters reported. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. Some 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops on Oct. 23, according to the Pentagon. U.S. President Joe Biden described the development as &quot;a very dangerous.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast. Yet, the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in the area. &quot;It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don&apos;t have more details just yet,&quot; Singh said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian military has not yet fought with or captured North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, said Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, on Oct. 28. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from using American-made long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia. At the same time, the U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, Zelensky announced on Oct. 21. Russian forces attacked downtown Kharkiv using a FAB-500 bomb on Oct. 28, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak later said that the strike damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), which has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. Around 9 p.m. local time, a series of explosions occurred in the city. The strikes caused a fire and heavy smoke in the central part of Kharkiv. At least six people were injured, Syniehubov said at around 9:30 p.m. local time. The attack damaged a medical facility as well as administrative buildings. Information on damage and casualties is being clarified, according to Terekhov. Russia has lost 650,000 troops, including killed and wounded, in the war against Ukraine, Zelensky said in an interview with Times of India, published on Oct. 28. Over 690,000 Russian military personnel were put out of action since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Besides the wounded and killed, this figure also includes those who were captured. Estonian intelligence estimated that Russia could lose up to 40,000 personnel in October. &quot;Russia itself has killed a lot of Russians. A lot of mobilized Russian soldiers were killed by the Russian army itself because they were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets, or to be wounded. So, they retreated and then were killed by their army,&quot; Zelensky told Times of India. &quot;This is their law of war,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Russia also does not pick up its dead soldiers from the battlefield, leaving their bodies to rot on the ground. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by freezing it if he wins the U.S. presidential election, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 28, citing its sources close to the former president&apos;s team. Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to the FT. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create autonomous zones in Russian occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or UN peacekeepers, will have to keep order. &quot;There are two things America will insist on. We will not have any men or women in the enforcement mechanism. We&#x2019;re not paying for it. Europe is paying for it,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s allies argue that Ukraine is losing the war and, therefore, pushing for a settlement is morally right. Trump believes that Biden should talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as presidents did with Soviet leaders during the Cold War, and that NATO membership is not an option for Ukraine in the short term. Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served in Trump&apos;s White House and is now at the America First Policy Institute Center for American Security, suggested in an interview with the FT that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO could be taken off the agenda for several years to force Russia to the negotiating table. Almost 80% of buildings in Vovchansk have been destroyed or damaged after Russia launched its offensive against the town, showed a joint investigation by Bellingcat and AFP published on Oct. 28. The once 17,000-people town, located just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast, became heavily contested following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Vovchansk endured a Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing most residents to flee their homes. Talking to journalists, the civilians recounted harrowing stories of escape, who, on occasion, deliberately targeted civilians during their attempts to flee. Some 60% of all buildings in the town were destroyed, and 18% were partially damaged, Bellingcat and AFP said, citing satellite imagery. As of late September, only 22% of the buildings remained intact. Despite Russia&#x2019;s surprise assault in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. Since then, the intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian tactics usually entail flattening towns and villages with artillery barrages and bombs before moving in to &quot;capture&quot; the ruined settlements. For example, no buildings were left intact in the Donetsk Oblast town of Toretsk as a result of the Russian onslaught, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-wont-impose-new-limitations-on-ukraines-use-of-american-weapons-if-north-korea-enters-war-pentagon-says/	2024-10-28T14:04:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Croatia to provide Ukraine with 30 tanks, 30 infantry fighting vehicles in exchange for German Leopard tanks	Croatian Defense Minister Ivan Anusic signed a memorandum with his German counterpart Boris Pistorius, under which the Croatian side will receive Leopard 2A8 tanks in exchange for the equipment it will transfer to Ukraine, according to Croatian Defense Ministry statement. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Croatia has provided Ukraine with over 300 million euros ($330 million) in assistance, including 11 defense packages. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new 12th aid package from an allied country in early September. Croatia has committed to supplying 30 M-84 tanks and 30 M-80 infantry fighting vehicles, as well as spare parts and ammunition, in exchange for financial means to purchase up to 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks, according to the memorandum. The total price of the new Leopard 2A8s will be reduced by the amount Germany will pay Croatia for transferring its equipment to Ukraine. Anusic expressed hope that the implementation of this initiative would begin &quot;very soon.&quot; &quot;All other details will be known after the contract is signed. An additional value of this procurement model is to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression,&quot; the statement read. On Oct. 9, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic signed a bilateral agreement on support and cooperation. This was the 27th bilateral agreement signed between Ukraine and a partner country since a joint G7 declaration during a NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/croatia-to-provide-ukraine-with-30-tanks-30-infantry-fighting-vehicles-in-exchange-for-german-leopard-tanks/	2024-10-28T13:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Leopard-2A4.jpg
Russia strikes downtown Kharkiv with aerial glide bombs, injuring at least 6	Russian forces attacked the center of Kharkiv using aerial glide bombs on Oct. 28, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. Around 9 p.m. local time, a series of explosions occurred in the city. The strikes caused a fire and heavy smoke in the central part of Kharkiv. At least six people were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said at around 9:30 p.m. local time. The attack damaged a medical facility as well as administrative buildings. Information on damage and casualties is being clarified, according to Terekhov. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-center-of-kharkiv-with-aerial-glide-bombs-injuring-at-least-5-people/	2024-10-28T13:06:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1553430606.jpeg
North Korea's current arms sales to Russia estimated at up to $5.5 billion, Friedrich Naumann Foundation suggests	North Korea is currently providing Russia with weapons worth up to $5.5 billion, according to a study by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, published on Oct. 28. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Pyongyang has significantly increased its arms supplies to its longtime ally, Moscow, fueling its aggression against Ukraine. This fall, North Korea also sent troops to participate in the war on Russia&apos;s side, as confirmed by Ukrainian military intelligence. Because North Korea and Russia do not publish official statistics on the country&apos;s bilateral trade, there is uncertainty. But even the minimum estimate of shipments is over $1.7 billion, the study reads. North Korea&apos;s revenues could increase by &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; as Pyongyang will receive money for sending soldiers. Meanwhile, the deployment of more than 20,000 North Korean soldiers seems &quot;unlikely,&quot; as it could jeopardize the stability of the North Korean regime. The risk of desertion and human resource constraints also stand in the way, according to the research. The tightening of relations between Russia and North Korea is also reflected in &quot;a notable rise&quot; in diplomatic visits. Media analysis shows that since July 2023, there have been an average of two monthly high-level meetings. In 2024, there have already been over 24 such meetings. In the past three decades, the norm was less than five meetings, the study read. &quot;Russia is turning to North Korea primarily because of its massive need for ammunition,&quot; Olena Guseinova, the study&apos;s author, said. &quot;Russia is using its relationship with North Korea &#x2013; and the potential transfer of military technology &#x2013; as a tool to test the unity of Western alliances, particularly in East Asia. Russia aims to pressure countries like South Korea and Japan into reconsidering their support for Ukraine,&quot; Guseinova added.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-current-arms-sales-to-russia-estimated-at-up-to-5-5-billion-friedrich-naumann-foundation-suggests/	2024-10-28T12:56:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Ukraine expands long-range drone strikes target list, alcohol now on the menu	Ukraine faces a tricky dilemma as winter approaches. &#xA0; How can it disrupt an expected mass Russian missile campaign targeting the country&apos;s infrastructure while simultaneously being barred from using Western-supplied weapons to strike deep inside Russia? Despite being limited to the use of long-range kamikaze drones, one method employed by Kyiv has scored some spectacular success in recent weeks. One of the largest explosions of the full-scale invasion saw, in the words of a Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) source, an ammunition warehouse &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth&quot; in Tver Oblast last month. This came just days after Ukraine confirmed attacks on two other arms depots, with the U.K. Defense Ministry saying the combined strikes caused &quot;the largest loss of ammunition&quot; in Russia during its all-out war against Ukraine. While the destruction of Russia&apos;s cruise and ballistic missiles by Ukrainian drones seems an obvious target for Kyiv&apos;s military planners, more recent strikes show the campaign is far broader. It now includes ethanol distilleries producing industrial alcohol. &quot;Russian military aviation cannot function without alcohol,&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said in a post on social media. &#xA0; His comments on Oct. 28 followed reports of a strike on an ethanol plant in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast the evening before. Kovalenko wasn&apos;t referring to the drinking habits of Russian pilots, but to the ethanol used in the manufacture of a wide range of both everyday items such as mouthwash and paint, to military-grade products needed to keep an air force flying. &quot;From fuel to braking systems, from liquids for technical needs, cleaning, to anti-icing agents. It&apos;s all alcohol,&quot; Kovalenko said. AQ 400 Scythe kamikaze drones in an undisclosed location in Dec. 2023. (Terminal Autonomy)Targeting the bottlenecksAs well as the strikes on ammunition depots, Ukraine has continued to target Russian factories, most recently the Kremniy El microelectronics plant in the Russian city of Bryansk overnight on Oct. 19. &quot;When you target an adversaries capabilities, there are always two ways of doing it &#x2014; you either target the capabilities themselves, like the missile storage sites, the aircraft that carry them, etc, or you can target production,&quot; Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. According to reports, the Kremniy El plant produced, among other things, components for Russia&apos;s Iskander ballistic missile, making the factory a perfect target for Ukraine, Hinz said. &quot;The smart way of doing things is&#x2026; to target the bottlenecks,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;And if you&apos;re very lucky, that bottleneck might not only be very narrow but may also not be as well-defended as other parts of the production process.&quot; And with the recent strikes targeting ethanol production, it appears Ukraine is attempting to target a potential bottleneck in Russian aviation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s concerted campaign to get permission to use Western-supplied weapons like the U.S-made ATACMs and the U.K&apos;s Storm Shadows to strike deep inside Russia has, to date, failed. Kyiv specifically hoped to be able to use the weapons to strike Russian airbases, destroying aircraft like the Tu-22 bomber that launch missiles against Ukrainian cities. Compounding the problem, while the international debate dragged its heels, the White House last month confirmed that Russia had moved 90% of its aircraft out of range of long-range missiles like the US-made ATACMS. While Russian airbases are still within range of Ukraine&apos;s long-range drones, they&apos;re far less effective against well-defended targets than ATACMs or Storm Shadows. &quot;One-way attack UAV usually have quite a small warhead so it&apos;s not the same as a ballistic or cruise missile,&quot; Hinz said. However, drones can potentially have an outsized impact when they hit highly flammable and less protected targets, such as ethanol distilleries. AQ 400 Scythe kamikaze drones. (Terminal Autonomy)The first recent reported Ukrainian strikes on Russian ethanol plants were overnight on Oct. 22, when a drone reportedly set fire to the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo. Videos posted to social media by panicking locals showed a huge fire at the scene of the strike. According to the Biokhim website, the plant produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast on the same night. And more recently, Russian media reported that Ukranian drone strikes on the evening of Oct. 27 targeted distilleries in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast. &quot;Strikes on distilleries are strikes on Russian aircraft in order to reduce their capabilities,&quot; Kovalenko said. But an expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent suggested Ukraine&apos;s tactic of targeting ethanol plants is unlikely to have a serious impact on Russian military aviation. &quot;While it sounds superficially plausible, it will be hard for such strikes to have a lasting impact, even in winter,&quot; Peter Layton, former Australian Air Force officer, Associate Fellow at RUSI, and Visiting Fellow at Griffith Asia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. Layton pointed out that ethanol is &quot;widely available globally,&quot; and even if all of Russia&apos;s production was taken out, a friendly country like China could resupply it quickly. &quot;New stocks can be quickly bought on the world market,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, Russian ethanol plants are likely to only be out of service for a short time until they are repaired. &quot;It sounds like a critical vulnerability but is unlikely to prove so.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expands-its-long-range-drone-strikes-target-list-alcohol-now-on-the-menu/	2024-10-28T12:11:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2087314148-1.jpg
US won't impose new restrictions on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea joins war, Pentagon says	The United States will not introduce new restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American weapons if North Korean troops engage in combat, the Pentagon said Oct. 28. following NATO&apos;s confirmation of North Korean troops&apos; deployment to Kursk Oblast. &quot;A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,&quot; said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, as Reuters reported. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. Some 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops on Oct. 23, according to the Pentagon. U.S. President Joe Biden described the development as &quot;a very dangerous.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast. Yet, the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in the area. &quot;It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don&apos;t have more details just yet,&quot; Singh said.Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from using American-made long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia. At the same time, the U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, Zelensky announced on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-impose-new-restrictions-on-ukraines-use-of-american-weapons-if-north-korea-joins-war-pentagon-says/	2024-10-28T11:17:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1459767214.jpg
Ukrainian forces have not yet engaged in combat with North Korean soldiers, military says	The Ukrainian military has not yet fought with or captured North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, said Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, on Pershyi TV channel on Oct. 28. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked whether North Korean troops have been spotted on the battlefield, Mysnyk said that intelligence data confirms that the Russian command is redeploying North Korean troops closer to the front in Kursk Oblast. Yet Ukrainian forces have not yet encountered them. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. While the White House did specify in what capacity they would be deployed, Ukraine and South Korea said that at least some North Korean troops would be used in combat. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals.

Georgians take streets in protest as pro-Russian party crowned election winner amid wide-scale fraud	Georgia has descended into political turmoil that is set to shape the country for years to come. Although exit polls indicated that the pro-European opposition coalition would win the Oct. 26 parliament elections, the official results paint a different picture. The Central Election Commission announced on the evening of Oct. 27 that the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party had won 54.08% of the vote, while a coalition of four pro-European opposition parties had won only 37.58%. International observers, opposition politicians, and the country&apos;s president all cried foul, alleging widespread electoral fraud. Thousands of Georgians were taking the streets of downtown Tbilisi in protest. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili was one of them. A day prior, Zourabichvili urged citizens to join her at Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Rustaveli Avenue to protest the falsified election.

(Photo by Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;These elections cannot be recognized. This is the same as recognizing Georgia&apos;s subordination to Russia. ... No one can take away Georgia&apos;s European future,&quot; she said. The ruling Georgian Dream party campaigned as the &quot;party of peace,&quot; highlighting the devastation of Ukrainian cities caused by the invading Russian forces as something that they could avoid by cozying up to Moscow. The ruling party also placed emphasis that electing the pro-European opposition is a potential route to war with Russia. The Georgian Dream campaign posters underline this rhetoric with slogans such as: &quot;With the Georgian Dream, say yes to peace, no to war.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t the brutal campaigning that delivered the favorable result for the ruling party, according to observers, it was the widespread fraud. Observers documented a range of violations, from the distribution of pre-filled ballots to the confiscation of personal identification cards. &quot;We&apos;ve witnessed ballots already marked in favor of the ruling party or voters being handed multiple ballots,&quot; a lawyer of We Vote told the Kyiv Independent from its headquarters on Liberty Square. The NGO also pointed out that criminal groups linked to the ruling party intimidated voters and observers throughout the day. During a press conference that followed the election, Iulian Bulai, a representative from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), said that &quot;free and fair elections were not assured.&quot; Following the remarks, Bulai promptly exited without answering questions. Oleksiy Honcharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker part of the PACE monitoring group, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;it&apos;s clear that Russia wants to have Georgia in its orbit.&quot; &quot;As always, they&apos;re using democratic procedures to make anti-democratic things. And that&apos;s what they&apos;re doing again here,&quot; Honcharenko said. &quot;What I personally saw in the rural area is very, very disturbing. It clearly influences the results of elections, so they can&apos;t be called fair and free,&quot; he added. A source close to U.S. intelligence services told Bloomberg that Georgian Dream&apos;s electronic infrastructure may have been compromised: &quot;The Russians appear to have taken possession of key servers,&quot; the unnamed source said. Georgia&apos;s opposition has drawn parallels between the current situation and Ukraine&apos;s ongoing conflict with Russia. &quot;We&apos;re fighting the same enemy,&quot; said opposition activist Marika Mikiashvili. &quot;The future of Georgia, free from Russian influence, is at stake.&quot; Ana Minadze, an activist with the NGO Free Georgia, was one of those who were planning to pretest. &quot;For me, the motivation is simple: Georgia will never become Russia,&quot; she said. Her sentiment echoes the sentiment of young activists who have grown up watching Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression and who reject any rapprochement with Moscow despite Georgian Dream&apos;s messaging. &quot;Our government is catering to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s interests,&quot; Minadze states. &quot;We&apos;ve lost 20 percent of our land to Russia, and yet Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgian Dream&apos;s oligarch leader, wants us to apologize to those who invaded us in 2008. That&apos;s something I&apos;ll never accept.&quot; Minadze believes Georgia&apos;s future lies within Europe, not Moscow&apos;s sphere. &quot;We&apos;ve been to Europe, we&apos;ve been to America; we know what Western life is like, and we know what Russia&apos;s like,&quot; she explained, emphasizing the divide she feels between freedom and repression. &quot;Education, economy, and everyday life &#x2014; we see what&apos;s at stake, and that&apos;s why we will protest.&quot; Meanwhile, Pro-Russian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition. The stand off had thus begun.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgians-take-streets-in-protest-as-pro-russian-party-crowned-election-winner-amid-wide-scale-fraud/	2024-10-28T10:36:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180886090.jpg
650,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in war against Ukraine, Zelensky says	Russia has lost 650,000 troops, including killed and wounded, in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Times of India, published on Oct. 28. Over 690,000 Russian military personnel were put out of action since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Besides the wounded and killed, this figure also includes those who were captured. Estonian intelligence estimated that Russia could lose up to 40,000 personnel in October. &quot;Russia itself has killed a lot of Russians. A lot of mobilized Russian soldiers were killed by the Russian army itself because they were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets, or to be wounded. So, they retreated and then were killed by their army,&quot; Zelensky told Times of India. &quot;This is their law of war,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Russia also does not pickup its dead soldiers from the battlefield, leaving their bodies to rot on the ground. Speaking about the situation at the front, the president said that in eastern Ukraine, the Russian army is advancing by employing human attack waves, &quot;throwing its soldiers into a meat grinder.&quot; In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russian troops set their sights on Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar, among other targets, with the latter located on a higher ground, after capturing Avdiivka in February. The higher ground could give Russian troops a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/650-000-russian-soldiers-have-been-killed-or-wounded-in-war-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-10-28T09:56:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193.jpg
Anti-money laundering watchdog refuses to blacklist Russia as Moscow cozies up to Iran, North Korea	After days of discussions, the world&#x2019;s leading anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), opted last week not to blacklist Russia despite efforts from Kyiv to sway members to do so over the Kremlin&#x2019;s increasingly closer ties with blacklisted North Korea and Iran. The FATF, which monitors illicit financial activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, suspended Russia&#x2019;s membership in February 2023 due to Moscow&#x2019;s conduct with blacklisted states and cyber crimes. The international organization met in Paris from Oct. 22 to 25 to discuss which countries should be moved from its gray and blacklists. But while the FATF upheld Moscow&#x2019;s suspension, it failed to take the punishment a step forward by branding Russia a &#x201C;high-risk country,&#x201D; marking another victory for Russia against a Western-led sanctions regime that has looked to ostracize it in the world. The FATF said it condemns Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the organization requires a full consensus from its 40 members to move Russia to its no-go list. Some countries, like South Africa and Brazil, have approached Russia more amicably than their Western counterparts. Ukraine, which is not a member, has tried to encourage the FATF to brand Russia as a high-risk country, but to no avail. In the leadup to the Paris plenary, Kyiv presented a dossier to the FATF that evidenced Moscow&#x2019;s increasingly close-knit relations with North Korea and Iran- both blacklisted states. &#x201C;Russia is threatening the security and integrity of the global economy by allowing sanctioned states like North Korea and Iran a back door to enter and destabilize the international financial system,&#x201D; the Finance Ministry said in a press release before the meetings. Ukraine&#x2019;s dossier also mentioned Russia&#x2019;s funding of the Kremlin-financed mercenary force the Wagner Group, the role of cryptocurrencies in financing Russian terrorism, and money laundering from stolen Ukrainian goods like grain and minerals, Politico reported.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Blacklisting Russia would have sent a strong symbolic message about the international community&#x2019;s support for Ukraine, Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based research group, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In practical terms, it would also force the financial system (both banks and their regulators) of countries that remain bafflingly indifferent to the Kremlin&apos;s murderous activity to pay attention to the transactions they are handling,&#x201D; he added. Russia is breaching the UN&#x2019;s sanctions and FATF&#x2019;s standards by blatantly working with North Korea, Keatinge said. Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with missiles and, more recently, troops to bolster its war on Ukraine in exchange for oil, the Finance Ministry said. The Finance Ministry also highlighted Russia&#x2019;s procurement of ballistic missiles from Iran and the two enemy nations&#x2019; close banking and financial cooperation. Days before the meeting, the ministry stressed the importance of acting decisively and looked to the FATF to lead the charge. &#x201C;Failing to challenge Russia&#x2019;s defiance would weaken the foundations and future stability of the global financial system,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said on Oct. 17. Keatinge said it is not clear why the FATF has not penalized Russia more harshly, but he noted that the multinational organization is &#x201C;fractured&#x201D; when it comes to geopolitics. He suggests that if the FATF is unwilling to take serious action, then it&#x2019;s down to the U.S., EU, and Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to press harder with sanctions. Ukraine&apos;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, U.K., on June 21, 2023. (Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to take the gloves off,&#x201D; he said. As Russia gets more desperate in its war, with limited battlefield successes and an economic squeeze, the greater the threat Moscow poses to the global economy, the Finance Ministry warned. The FATF told its members to stay vigilant about emerging risks and the Finance Ministry said it will work with individual governments to counter Russia&#x2019;s financial crimes. Russia continues to work with cybercriminal gangs, like the Russia-based Evil Corp, to target global economies, including those of several FATF member states, the ministry claims. The U.S. recently sanctioned members of Evil Corp, claiming that the group developed and distributed the Dridex malware. Over 40 countries and hundreds of banks were impacted by the malware, causing $100 million in theft losses and damage. Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market (EM) sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, stressed that tightening sanctions would weaken Russia&#x2019;s economy, restricting its ability to wage war on Ukraine and give Ukraine and the West leverage in future negotiations. But the FATF&#x2019;s decision to not blacklist Russia has instead again unearthed the lack of leadership among the West when it comes to curtailing Russia, he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This should have been a slam dunk,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/anti-money-laundering-watchdog-refuses-to-blacklist-russia-despite-moscows-cozying-up-to-north-korea-iran/	2024-10-28T09:10:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179397996.jpg
Trump plans to end Russia's war in Ukraine by freezing it if he wins presidential election, FT reports	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to end the Russian war in Ukraine by freezing it if he wins the U.S. presidential election, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 28, citing its sources close to the former president&apos;s team. Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to the FT. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would autonomous zones in Russian occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or UN peacekeepers, will have to keep order. &quot;There are two things America will insist on. We will not have any men or women in the enforcement mechanism. We&#x2019;re not paying for it. Europe is paying for it,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s allies argue that Ukraine is losing the war and, therefore, pushing for a settlement is morally right. Trump believes that Biden should talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as presidents did with Soviet leaders during the Cold War, and that NATO membership is not an option for Ukraine in the short term. Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served in Trump&apos;s White House and is now at the America First Policy Institute Center for American Security, suggested in an interview with the FT that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO could be taken off the agenda for several years to force Russia to the negotiating table. &quot;We freeze the conflict, Ukraine does not cede any territory, they don&apos;t give up their territorial claims, and we have negotiations with the understanding there probably won&apos;t be a final agreement until Putin leaves the stage,&quot; Fleitz said. This approach, though, will not have unanimous support within the Republican Party, the FT reported, citing the European Council on Foreign Relations. Mike Waltz, one of the foremost Republican speakers on national security in the House of Representatives, suggested that Trump could threaten to collapse the Russian economy by lowering oil and gas prices to bring Putin to the negotiating table. &quot;You flood the world with cheaper, cleaner American oil and gas. You drive down the price,&quot; Waltz added. Saudi Arabia, an important ally of Trump&apos;s during his first term, would not welcome such a move. Yet people close to Trump insist he will put economic solid pressure on Putin. &quot;He (Trump) has shown he knows how to bring both sides to the table,&quot; said Ric Grenell, who was an outspoken ambassador to Berlin and a Balkans envoy in Trump&apos;s first term, recalling the Abraham Accords, the agreements signed between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, when Trump was in office. &quot;He&apos;s done it consistently. Arabs and Israelis, Russians and Ukrainians will be next.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine-by-freezing-it-if-he-wins-presidential-election-ft-reports/	2024-10-28T09:06:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukraine sabotages railway bridge in occupied Berdiansk, intelligence source claims	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) and the Ukrainian resistance sabotaged a railway bridge in the occupied city of Berdiansk, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 28. The bridge between the Vodokanal utility company building and a car wash at Skhidnyi Avenue was blown up after several explosions overnight, according to the source. The port city of Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast has been occupied by Russia since early 2022. The city lies at the Azov Sea and serves as a key transport hub for occupying authorities, namely to ship out looted grain and other resources from occupied Ukraine. A military intelligence source told Ukrinform that the bridge&apos;s destruction paralyzed Russia&apos;s railway connection with Berdiansk. This allegedly prevents Moscow from supplying fuel, arms, and ammunition to its forces in the occupied city via railway. Older satellite imagery of the railway bridge allegedly targeted by HUR and the Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied Berdiansk, Ukraine, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Google Maps)Explosions at the bridge were also reported by the exiled local authorities on Telegram. &quot;According to preliminary information, the railway bridge between the Vodokanal building and the car wash on Skhidnyi Avenue was blown up,&quot; the exiled Berdiansk city military administration said. The Russian state media dismissed the reports as a &quot;blatant disinformation campaign,&quot; connecting the blasts to exercises of Russian forces in the city and claiming that all bridges in Berdiansk stand intact. Ukrinform&apos;s source refuted claims by the Russian media, citing a lack of visual evidence. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims, as neither Ukraine nor Russia provided footage of the bridge after the supposed explosions.	https://kyivindependent.com/berdiansk-bridge/	2024-10-28T07:21:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242319542.jpg
Finnish court orders seizing Russian assets at request of Ukraine's Naftogaz company	A Finnish court in Helsinki ruled in favor of Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz and ordered the seizure of Russia&apos;s assets in Finland worth tens of millions of dollars, the company&#x2019;s statement read on Oct. 28. According to a ruling in 2023 by the Permanent Arbitration Court based in The Hague, Russia is obliged to pay $5 billion to Naftogaz Group as compensation for assets illegally seized during the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. &quot;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the funds stipulated by The Hague decision, we continue to use all available mechanisms to collect them. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice,&quot; Oleksii Chernyshov, head of the Naftogaz Group, said in the statement. The Finnish court ordered the seizure of &quot;real estate and other assets,&quot; Naftogaz said without providing further details. According to the company, Russia violated the agreement between the two countries on protecting each other&#x2019;s investments when it illegally annexed Crimea and expropriated strategically important energy investments of Naftogaz. Today&apos;s ruling marks the first instance of enforcing this decision in a third-country&#x2019;s court, the statement read. Interest on the rest of Russia&#x2019;s obligations to pay will continue to accrue until the full payment of the arbitration, the company noted.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-court-orders-seizing-russian-assets-at-request-of-ukraines-naftogaz/	2024-10-28T07:02:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1231980097.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Iceland for 4th Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Iceland on Oct. 28 to attend the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit and meet with Nordic leaders. This is Zelensky&apos;s first official visit to the island country, during which he will meet the prime ministers of Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. &quot;The Nordic countries are our principled and resolute allies, and the Ukraine-Nordic Platform stands as one of our most productive multilateral formats,&quot; Zelensky said on X. According to the president, the talks will focus on international support for Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan and on &quot;financing Ukrainian weapons production and long-range capabilities, winterization efforts, maritime security, restriction on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet, enhancing defense assistance, providing training and equipment for Ukrainian forces.&quot; The Ukrainian president will also meet Iceland&apos;s parliamentary leaders and attend the session of the Nordic Council, an inter-parliamentary cooperation group of the Nordic countries. Zelensky previously attended the third Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit held in Stockholm in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-iceland/	2024-10-28T06:43:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Almost 80% of Vovchansk's buildings destroyed, damaged in Russian attacks, analysis says	Almost 80% of buildings in Vovchansk have been destroyed or damaged after Russia launched its offensive against the town, a joint investigation by Bellingcat and AFP published on Oct. 28 showed. The once 17,000-strong town, located just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast, became heavily contested following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Vovchansk endured a Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes. Talking to journalists, the civilians recounted harrowing stories of escape from Russian occupiers, who, on occasion, deliberately targeted civilians during their attempts to flee. According to the report, a library, a school, and a church were among the many destroyed buildings. Some 60% of all buildings in the town were destroyed, and 18% were partially damaged, Bellingcat and AFP said, citing satellite imagery. As of late September, only 22% of the buildings remained intact. Despite Russia&#x2019;s surprise assault in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. Since then, the intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian tactics usually entail flattening towns and villages with artillery barrages and bombs before moving in to &quot;capture&quot; the ruined settlements. For example, no buildings were left intact in the Donetsk Oblast town of Toretsk as a result of the Russian onslaught, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-80-of-vovchansks-buildings-destroyed-damaged-in-russian-attacks/	2024-10-28T06:17:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152881526.jpg
NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed in Russia's Kursk Oblast	North Korea has sent troops to Russia, and they have already been deployed in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 28 after meeting South Korean defense and intelligence officials. Rutte joined other Western leaders in confirming reports by Kyiv and Seoul that Pyongyang is sending military personnel to Russia as a sign of deepening cooperation between the two countries. &quot;Today, I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk region,&quot; the NATO secretary general said in Brussels. This comes as the secretary general&apos;s first official confirmation of North Korean troops arriving in Russia. The South Korean delegation also briefed the North Atlantic Council and representatives from Japan, Australia, and New Zealand on the North Korean involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian cross-border offensive. While the White House did specify in what capacity they would be deployed, Ukraine and South Korea said that at least some North Korean troops would be used in combat. Rutte commented that the deployment represents &quot;a significant escalation in (North Korea&apos;s) ongoing involvement in Russia&apos;s illegal war&quot; and a &quot;dangerous expansion of Russia&apos;s war.&quot; Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The spy agency said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast, a claim at the time unconfirmed by Western officials. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. &quot;The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. It undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels the Russian war against Ukraine,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;North Korean troops are already in the Kursk region. This is exactly as we discussed, and as South Korea confirmed. Now, our allies and NATO can see it,&quot; Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on social media. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone between Oct. 27 and 28. &quot;(Russia is) increasingly engaging North Korea as an ally, and any day now, their soldiers may appear on the battlefield fighting against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine will be forced to actually fight against North Korea in Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-confirms-north-korean-troops-are-in-russias-kursk-oblast/	2024-10-28T05:08:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Rutte.jpeg
Harris likely to struggle with pushing Ukraine aid through Congress if elected, Bloomberg reports	The U.S. might eventually scale down support for Ukraine even if Democratic candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 27, citing undisclosed Western official sources. Even if Harris sits in the White House, her administration will probably struggle to pass significant resources for Ukraine through U.S. Congress, the outlet wrote. The vice president will face Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 in an election often described as pivotal for Washinton&apos;s future support for Ukraine. While Harris is largely expected to continue the Kyiv-friendly policy of President Joe Biden, there are fears that Trump would seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin to achieve a faster resolution, even at the cost of painful concessions by Ukraine. Ukraine, which continues to face heavy onslaught by Russian forces in the country&apos;s east, can likely expect a decrease in U.S. assistance in any case as the fatigue in the West grows, according to Bloomberg. The Republican-led House of Representatives, the legislature&apos;s lower chamber, resisted the adoption of a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine for many months, directly contributing to Ukraine&apos;s setbacks on the battlefield. During the lull in U.S. assistance, Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the stronghold of Avdiivka in February under the barrage of Russian bombs and artillery shells, underscoring the key role of Washington&apos;s support. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly derailed the vote on the bill before finally introducing it in April, recently said he has no &quot;appetite for further Ukraine funding&quot; and hopes that a November electoral victory for Trump will bring a swift end to the war. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. This included $64 billion in military aid, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Facing Russian advances and the weakening support from partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky has pitched a five-step victory plan for ending the war by 2025. The proposal includes additional defense assistance, an immediate invitation to join NATO, and the lifting of restrictions on long-range strikes against Russia, among other steps.	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-aid-ukraine/	2024-10-28T04:45:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173768130.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 38 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 28. At least 21 people were injured overnight, including five children, as Russia launched multiple air attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, the State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged a high-rise building and destroyed at least three apartments in the city of Kharkiv, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Ukrainian air defenses shot 66 Russian attack drones and 24 of them were lost across various regions, the Air Force said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes killed five people and injured 13, with one child among the injured. Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, a medical facility, and residential areas in the region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on his Telegram channel. A woman and two men were injured as a result of Russian attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Governor Ivan Fedorov said that at least seven buildings were damaged during the strikes. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured and more than 50 building were damaged as a result of Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-5-injure-38-over-past-day/	2024-10-28T04:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kharkiv-Oct-28.jpg
Ex-North Korean soldiers seek Ukraine deployment to influence former comrades, media reports	A group of almost 200 ex-North Korean soldiers asked to be deployed in Ukraine to help demoralize and influence Pyongyang&apos;s troops joining the war on Russia&apos;s side, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Oct. 28. Kyiv, Seoul, and the Western countries accused North Korea of sending thousands of troops to aid Russia&apos;s ongoing war against Ukraine. According to Ukraine, Moscow is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers as a boost to its war effort. The first batch should reportedly be deployed in Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region partially held by Ukrainian forces. In response to the reports, a group of North Korean defectors living in South Korea offered their experience with the North Korean military to help wage psychological warfare against Moscow&apos;s allies, the South China Morning Post writes. &quot;North Korean soldiers are there essentially as mercenaries, but we would go as volunteers with a goodwill mission,&quot; said Lee Min-bok, one of the initiative&apos;s key figures who posted an appeal for deployment to the Ukrainian Embassy in Seoul. &quot;Simply our presence in Ukraine could significantly impact the morale of North Korean troops,&quot; Lee noted, saying that North Korean troops are treated as &quot;cannon fodder.&quot; &quot;North Korean soldiers could find hope and courage in our presence in Ukraine, inspiring them to cross over in search of freedom.&quot; Russia has employed the tactics of mass infantry attacks in Ukraine, overwhelming Ukrainian defenders at the cost of extremely high casualty rates. Seeking to avoid a full mobilization, the Kremlin has sought fresh manpower among convicts, migrant workers, and, most recently, North Korean allies. &quot;We are all military veterans who understand North Korea&#x2019;s military culture and psychological state better than anyone else,&quot; said Ahn Chan-il, another member of the initiative who leads the World Institute for North Korea Studies. &quot;We&#x2019;re ready to go wherever needed to work as psychological warfare agents &#x2013; through loudspeaker broadcasts, distributing leaflets, and even acting as interpreters.&quot; The Kyiv Independent has reached out to the Ukrainain Embassy in Seoul for comment but has not immediately received a response. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 24 indirectly acknowledged the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia, responding to claims of satellite imagery with &quot;if there are images, they reflect something&quot; and citing Pyongyang&apos;s defense treaty with Moscow. North Korea&apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send troops to Russia would comply with international law but did not explicitly confirm the reports. On Oct. 24, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that the country could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities.&quot; South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul have been rising parallel to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Recently, the North Korean government declared South Korea a hostile state and blew up two major roads connecting it to the southern part of the peninsula.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-north-korean-soldiers-seek-deployment-in-ukraine/	2024-10-28T03:07:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
That's what they do' — Trump's running mate Vance brushes off Russian election interference	Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance dismissed calls for stepping against Russia&#x2019;s latest attempt to meddle in the U.S. elections in an interview with CBS News on Oct. 27. U.S. intelligence warned that Russia is using disinformation to undermine the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ahead of the presidential election Nov. 5. Vance, who is the running mate of Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump, has previously criticized aid for Kyiv and said he &quot;doesn&apos;t really care what happens to Ukraine.&quot; &quot;I think a lot of countries are going to try to manipulate our voters. They&apos;re going to try to manipulate our elections. That&apos;s what they do,&quot; J.D. Vance told CBS News. A fake video began circulating on the internet that showed votes for Trump being torn up by a man in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, posted by an anonymous X account with a history of spreading Russian disinformation. &quot;I can call them (Moscow) to knock it off, but this is not a schoolyard,&quot; Vance said. U.S. officials later confirmed that Russia was behind the fake video, attempting to undermine confidence in the upcoming election. Vance also criticized sanctions imposed on Russia, saying, &quot;They&apos;ve gone off like a wet firecracker.&quot; In another interview the same day, Vance called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;competitor&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot; to the U.S. rather than an enemy and went on to say that negotiations with Moscow are &quot;a necessary part&quot; of ending the war in Ukraine.&#x200C;&#x200C; Vance&apos;s comments come just over one week before the U.S. presidential election, which carries high stakes for the future of American military support to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-russian-election-interference/	2024-10-28T02:00:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153568546.jpg
Sandu's rival claims support for Ukraine, Moldovan president calls him 'Moscow's man'	Moldovan presidential candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo claimed he would continue supporting Ukraine, a statement dismissed by incumbent President Maia Sandu during a presidential debate on Oct. 27. Stoianoglo, supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, will face pro-EU Sandu in a run-off presidential vote on Nov. 3. Stoianoglo and Sandu won 25.95% and 42.49% in the first round on Oct. 20, respectively. When Sandu asked how he would develop relations with Ukraine, Stoianoglo said that he would &quot;establish good relations with all development partners.&quot; &quot;We support Ukraine in the war, we provide them with humanitarian aid, and I am confident that our relations will only grow stronger during my presidency,&quot; the presidential candidate said, adding, &quot;Now, there are only militaristic statements.&quot; &quot;Do you believe what you are saying? In Kyiv, they know you&apos;re Moscow&apos;s man,&quot; Sandu retorted. According to the incumbent president, Stoianoglo is backed by Igor Dodon, Moldova&apos;s pro-Russian head of state between 2016 and 2020 who is facing corruption and treason charges. Moldovan authorities accused Moscow and pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor of buying votes to influence the elections against Sandu and against the parallel referendum on EU membership. The non-binding referendum on enshrining Chisinau&apos;s EU aspirations in the constitution passed with a razor-thin margin of 50.35%, a significantly lower result than expected. Sandu has supported Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and took her country on a clearly pro-EU path, launching accession talks earlier this year. Stoianoglo, Moldova&apos;s former prosecutor general hailing from the largely pro-Russian region of Gagauzia, presented himself as a fresh candidate who could unify the opposition. Sandu and some observers said that his candidacy was merely Moscow&apos;s ploy to put forward a more acceptable candidate than Dodon.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandus-rival-claims-support-for-ukraine-moldovan-president-calls-him-moscows-man/	2024-10-28T01:36:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178415794.jpg
Adnan Kivan, owner of Kyiv Post, dies at 61	Businessman Adnan Kivan, owner of the KADORR Group and the English-language Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Post, has passed away, the KADORR Group announced on Oct. 28. In a statement on Facebook, the company lauded Kivan&apos;s &quot;successful business projects, social initiatives, as well as charity and patronage&quot; and extended condolences to his wife, children, and grandchildren. Kivan, an Odesa-based millionaire and investor of Syrian origin, would have turned 62 in December. The statement did not specify the cause of death. The businessman, whose activities were focused on construction and agriculture, was also involved in the media sector. He purchased the Kyiv Post in 2018 from British-Ukrainian businessman Mohammad Zahoor. Conflicts over editorial independence with the newsroom led to Kivan suspending the Kyiv Post and firing the staff in November 2021. The Kyiv Post&apos;s former editorial team subsequently founded the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/kivan/	2024-10-28T01:31:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kivan.png
US, EU call for investigation of Georgian elections after reports of intimidation, irregularities	The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged an investigation of the Georgian parliamentary elections over reports of irregularities in statements made on Oct. 27. The Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won almost 54% of the vote in the Oct. 26 elections, but international observers declared the results neither free nor fair. Pro-EU opposition parties have disputed the ruling party&apos;s victory, and President Salome Zourabichvili said on Oct. 27 that she would not recognize the results and called for mass protests. &quot;We call on the Central Election Commission of Georgia and other relevant authorities to fulfill their duty to swiftly, transparently, and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof,&quot; Borell said in a statement. &quot;We condemn all contraventions of international norms and join calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations.&quot; Blinken encouraged &quot;Georgia&#x2019;s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together.&quot; &quot;While international and local observers agreed that Election Day was generally well administered, we note reports of irregularities and sporadic violence. &#xA0;International observers have not declared the result to be free and fair,&quot; the U.S. chief diplomat said. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. According to a report by the Election Observation Mission led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), &quot;the election day was&#x2026; marked by a tense environment, with frequent compromises in vote secrecy and several procedural inconsistencies, as well as reports of intimidation and pressure on voters&#x2026; especially on public sector voters.&quot; The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. Tbilisi&apos;s relations with Washington also deteriorated over the past months as the U.S. began curbing partnership programs and imposed sanctions against Georgian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-eu-georgian-elections/	2024-10-28T00:16:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 690,720 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 690,720 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 28. This number includes 1,680 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Russia's attack on Kharkiv Oblast injures 21, Ukrainian officials report	At least 21 people were injured overnight on Oct. 28, including five children, as Russia launched multiple air attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged a high-rise and destroyed at least three apartments in the city of Kharkiv, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. First responders have been dispatched to the sites of the attacks. Earlier on Oct. 27, six people were injured following the attacks in the city&apos;s Saltivskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts. Terekhov added that at least 21 private residences and four cars were damaged in the strike. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on Telegram that in the city of Chuhuiv, a warehouse building was destroyed in an attack, though no injuries were reported. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-strikes-in-kharkiv-oblast-injure-21-ukrainian-officials-report/	2024-10-27T22:57:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-27-23_52_46.jpeg
Zelensky claims PM Modi can help end war in 'Times of India' interview	President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the potential role of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in mediating peace talks to end the ongoing war in Ukraine. &quot;Modi is the PM of a really huge country from the perspective of population, economy, influence and impact. Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war &#x2013; we are all interested in that. PM Modi can influence the end of the Ukraine war. This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is the huge value of India,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 28 in an interview with the &quot;Times of India.&quot; The president also expressed optimism about the possibility of negotiations taking place in India: &quot;Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that... but I think we need to prepare ourselves... and only according to our format because the war is in our land... we have the platform which is the peace summit.&quot; With winter approaching and ongoing attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, the country faces significant challenges, including pressure from Russian advances across Donetsk Oblast and uncertainties surrounding U.S. support amid upcoming presidential elections. Zelensky warned that a Trump victory could jeopardize vital military aid for Kyiv. Zelensky underscored the importance of strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s energy systems and reiterated that the recently revealed victory plan and NATO membership are aimed at fortifying Ukraine&#x2019;s position for future negotiations: &quot;The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia... What we are asking for is an invitation to NATO so that in the future nobody can change their opinion.&quot; Zelensky also urged Modi to take concrete actions rather than mere rhetoric, saying that India&apos;s influence could be pivotal in addressing issues such as the return of Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia. &quot;You can force Putin to bring back Ukrainian children... Let PM Modi bring back at least 1,000 Ukrainian children.&quot; A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-times-of-india-pm-modi-can-influence-end-of-war/	2024-10-27T21:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/bbda75822c936b21a2a721ef46f66183_1724407316_extra_large.jpeg
JD Vance says Taiwan more vital to US than Ukraine due to key role in chip production	Republican Senator and vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance questioned the importance of Ukraine to U.S. strategic interests on a recent episode of &quot;The Tim Dillon Show&quot; podcast, which aired on Oct. 26. &#xA0; Vance suggested that Ukraine is less crucial than other regions, specifically Taiwan, which he highlighted as the world&#x2019;s leading producer of semiconductor chips. &quot;My whole argument with the Russia-Ukraine (war) is that Russia should have never invaded Ukraine, a lot of innocent people are being killed... Our interest is in peace. But part of that is motivated by my view that Ukraine is not nearly as important to us as other regions of the world, right? Just putting my cards on the table,&quot; Vance told Tim Dillon, an American stand-up comedian, who questioned Vance on various topics, including those related to foreign policy. &quot;Taiwan makes so much of the computer chips, which is such a driver of all economic growth, that if the Chinese took over Taiwan, it would be really bad for us.&quot; When asked about the cause of the war in Ukraine, Vance replied: &quot;Did American diplomacy actually create conflict instead of diffusing conflict? In my view, it did.&quot; Vance, who was selected as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&apos;s running mate in July, has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine. He repeatedly has said that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Vance also repeatedly disparaged Ukraine and voiced his unwillingness to continue U.S. support in leaked text messages with far-right conspiracy theorist Charles Johnson, the Washington Post reported on Aug. 7. Vance also rejected the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin would extend his military operations beyond Ukraine into Europe. He labeled the idea of Putin marching through Europe as &quot;absurd&quot; and expressed doubt about the likelihood of Putin pursuing goals beyond his current objectives in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-says-taiwan-more-vital-to-us-than-ukraine-due-to-key-role-in-chip-production/	2024-10-27T19:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153568546.jpg
Canada ships first armored combat support vehicles to Ukraine	Canada has provided Ukraine with a new shipment of Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) 6.0 ACSV specially configured as ambulances, the Canadian Armed Forces&#x2019; Operation UNIFIER announced on Oct. 26. Armored Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs) are an extension of the existing LAV 6.0 family of vehicles in service with the Canadian army. Although the exact number of vehicles remains unknown, this delivery comes after extensive training for Ukrainian personnel in Germany. This contribution is part of Canada&#x2019;s ongoing military assistance to Ukraine, which has amounted to nearly $4.5 billion since 2022. In September 2023, Canada committed to transferring 50 LAV 6.0 ACSV to Ukraine over a three-year period, as part of a $650 million investment in military aid. Following the operator and maintenance training on the ACSV, ambulance variant, in Germany, the vehicles were loaded up and sent to Ukraine.These vehicles will help Ukraine in their ongoing defence of an unlawful invasion to their land #SlavaUkraini pic.twitter.com/tibGiSfgxX Earlier this year, Canada announced additional support, including 80,840 CRV-7 rocket motors, 1,300 warheads, machine guns and pistols, and M113 chassis. Canada has placed no geographical restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Canadian-donated tanks and armored vehicles. This policy positions Canada among the countries&#x2014;including Germany, the U.S., and the U.K.&#x2014;that have approved using most Western-supplied equipment in Ukraine&#x2019;s current operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-ships-first-armored-combat-support-vehicles-to-ukraine/	2024-10-27T18:39:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GakZWxCWUAAw5-E.jpeg
Russia's attacks kill 5 civilians in Kherson Oblast	At least five civilians were killed and four injured in Russian attacks on Oct. 27 in Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Kherson Oblast, which remains divided by the front line and frequently endures Russian artillery, drone, and missile strikes, according to the regional governor. An elderly man died after a drone dropped explosives on him, and others were killed by artillery fire, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported via his Telegram channel. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Oct. 27 address that Russia had deployed over 1,100 guided aerial bombs, 560 attack drones, and around 20 missiles against Ukraine in the past week. &quot;Russia continues its terror campaign against Ukraine, with daily assaults on our people, towns, and villages, employing a range of weapons,&quot; Zelensky said, urging Kyiv&#x2019;s allies to increase pressure on Moscow. Earlier on Oct. 27, Ukraine&#x2019;s military reported that air defenses had intercepted 44 out of 91 Russian drones launched overnight, adding that the attacks caused damages to civilian infrastructure in northeastern Sumy Oblast and in the city of Dnipro.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attacks-kill-5-civilians-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-10-27T16:46:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson-1.jpeg
Kyiv appeals to UN, Red Cross after reports of Russian soldiers murdering civilians in Selydove	Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 27 that he had written to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations after reports circulated on social media alleging that Russian soldiers had killed two civilian women in Selydove. Ukrainian prosecutors launched a war crime investigation on Oct. 27 in response to social media footage and other reports that Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person. &quot;The alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in Selydove is a war crime,&quot; Lubinets said. &quot;I immediately sent letters to international organizations: UN and ICRC. I am waiting for a response.&quot; The embattled Selydove has seen heavy fighting as Russian forces push deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. One posted video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire on a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. A local resident was reportedly injured in the shooting, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. Other reports allege that in another incident, two women were murdered by Russian troops. The bodies were found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, according to prosecutors. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. Earlier this week, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-appeals-to-un-red-cross-after-reports-of-russian-soldiers-murdering-civilians-in-selydove/	2024-10-27T14:56:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1246182421.jpeg
Drone damages industrial facility in Russia's Voronezh Oblast, governor says	Debris from a downed drone struck an industrial facility in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast the evening of Oct. 27, regional governor Alexander Gusev said via his official Telegram channel. Russian air defense units intercepted multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the region, Gusev claimed. &quot;As a result of the fall of one UAV, an annex to a utility room at an industrial enterprise was damaged,&quot; he said. According to Gusev, no casualties have been reported. The Astra Telegram channel posted video footage purporting to show an explosion at a facility in Voronezh Oblast at the time of the reported drone strike. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 27 that seven drones were shot down over Voronezh, Belgorod, and Bryansk oblasts. Kyiv has not yet commented on these reports. Ukraine has launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s military infrastructure and oil industry. Ukraine on Oct. 4 attacked the Annanefteprodukt fuel and lubricants storage base near the village of Anna in Voronezh Oblast, according to the General Staff. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent later that the oil depot was struck by drones operated by the SBU.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-damages-industrial-facility-in-russias-voronezh-oblast-governor-says/	2024-10-27T14:07:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2159777032--1-.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia transporting North Korean troops to front lines in civilian trucks, military intelligence says	Key developments on Oct. 27: Russia is transporting North Korean soldiers to the front lines via trucks with civilian license plates, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Oct. 27. The announcement follows reports from U.S. and Ukrainian officials that a contingent of North Korean troops is headed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to assist Moscow in countering Ukraine&apos;s offensive in the region. Russian police officers on Oct. 27 stopped a Kamaz truck with civilian license plates on the Kursk-Voronezh highway, HUR said via its official Telegram channel. The vehicle was reportedly loaded with North Korean military personnel, but the driver did not have documented combat orders. In an intercepted radio communication, officers of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade are trying to sort out the problem of the stopped truck, according to audio published by HUR. The unit was expecting to receive North Korean reinforcements via the Kamaz truck. The audio records the officers discussing why the truck was stopped on the Kursk-Voronezh highway and why the driver lacked proper documentation. HUR&apos;s report indicates that North Korean troops are on their way to Russian units, aligning with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. While Russia and North Korea first dismissed Ukraine&apos;s reports that North Korean troops were joining the war, the leaders of the two countries have changed their language in recent days, moving from denial to justification. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 24 indirectly acknowledged the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia, responding to claims of satellite imagery with &quot;if there are images, they reflect something&quot; and citing Pyongyang&apos;s defense treaty with Moscow. North Korea&apos;s foreign ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send troops to Russia would comply with international law. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have likely opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said on Oct. 27. Selydove is the site of heavy battles as Russian forces are pushing deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crime investigation into footage and reports shared on social media that accuse Russian soldiers of shooting at and murdering the town&apos;s residents. One video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire against a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. One resident was injured and was provided assistance by Ukrainian soldiers who arrived at the scene afterward, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. In a separate incident, two women have been reportedly murdered by Russian troops. The bodies have been found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, the prosecutors said, citing media reports and open sources. An investigation to establish circumstances and perpetrators is underway, the statement read. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. There have been numerous reports of murder and torture of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war as Moscow continues its all-out war and holds roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Ukrainian forces continue to hold all the dominant heights near Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and are attempting to restore their positions, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 27. The spokesperson said this in reaction to a recent report by the Ukrainian monitoring service DeepState, which claimed that Russian forces had captured the settlement. The Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, just as it continues its drive in the Donbas region in Ukraine&apos;s east. Voloshyn said he would not call Levadne a settlement but a simple &quot;point in an open field&quot; positioned in a lowland, which makes it difficult to defend. The spokesperson acknowledged that Russian forces have focused great efforts in the sector, achieving &quot;partial success&quot; and driving a wedge into Ukrainian defenses. He did not say explicitly whether the entire Levadne was captured, as DeepState reported. According to Voloshyn, Russia has intensified its operations in the area after capturing the Donetsk Oblast town of Vuhledar at the beginning of October. Levadne is located near the administrative borders of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Vuhledar and 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the city of Zaporizhzhia. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported downing 51 Ukrainian drones overnight on Oct. 27, with 18 of them intercepted over western Tambov Oblast. Drones struck the Michurinsky district of the region at around 0:40 a.m. local time, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, Governor Maxim Egorov claimed on his Telegram channel. The Astra Telegram channel alleged that the fire broke out at the Transneft Druzhba control station in the village of Novonikolskoye. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Transneft Druzhba is a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s leading state-controlled oil company, Transneft. It operates the Druzhba pipeline, built to funnel Russian oil to European countries via Belarus and Ukraine. The Michurinsky Oil Refinery is also located in the village of Novonikolskoye. Ukraine has carried out long-range drone strikes into Russian territory, often targeting oil refineriesand depots to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and diminish Moscow&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues, crucial for funding the war. Russia claimed its forces had also downed 16 drones over Belgorod Oblast, four each over Bryansk, Lipetsk, and Oryol oblasts, three over Voronezh Oblast, and one over Kursk Oblast. Other Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down over the Azov Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-transporting-north-korean-troops-to-front-lines-in-civilian-trucks-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-27T13:14:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166685743.jpg
To protect Taiwan, help Ukraine defeat Russia, former UK defense secretary says	If Western nations allow Russia to defeat Ukraine, China will see it as a signal to invade Taiwan, former U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in an editorial for the Sunday Times published Oct. 26. Fears of escalating Chinese military intervention in Taiwan have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The war has served as a possible model of how both Taipei and the international community might respond if Beijing decides to invade. &quot;(W)e have the opportunity to send a clear message to the Chinese leadership that subjugating the neighboring democracy by force will never be acceptable,&quot; Shapps wrote in the Sunday Times. &quot;We must send this message by acting much closer to home, here in Europe.&quot; Stepping up support for Ukraine is the most effective way to deter China from attacking Taiwan, Shapps writes, saying a conflict between Beijing and Taipei would have a devastating impact on the global economy. &quot;Now is therefore the time not only to provide long-range permission for our Storm Shadow missiles but to do so without awaiting a decision from Washington,&quot; Shapps said. The Ukrainian military has received British Storm Shadows, long-range missiles that can fly up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), but is not permitted to use them on Russian soil. Kyiv has urged its allies to lift restrictions on the use of Western-provided weapons, a step that is also included in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;The cost of allowing the use of our weapons, even inside Russia if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin attacks from there, would be minimal compared with the consequences of Putin winning &#x2014; and thereby allowing others to believe that you can time out the West&#x2019;s interest,&quot; Shapps said. Shapps called on the U.K. and other Western goverments to ramp up their military aid to Ukraine, arguing that a strong defense of Ukraine alongside &quot;peaceful political discussion&quot; with China offered the best strategy to protect Taiwan and avoid escalated global conflict. &quot;Redoubling our support for Ukraine today would not only be doing the right thing but would also make an invasion of Taiwan much less likely, thereby protecting us from a recession or even depression,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/taiwan-at-risk-if-russia-prevails-in-ukraine-former-uk-defense-secretary-says/	2024-10-27T12:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1701095780.jpg
JD Vance declines to call Putin enemy, calls for negotiations with Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin is more a &quot;competitor&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot; to the U.S. than an enemy, Republican Senator and vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said in an interview with NBC News on Oct. 27. Vance&apos;s comments come just over one week before the U.S. presidential election, which carries high stakes for the future of American military support to Ukraine. &quot;I think that he&apos;s clearly an adversary. He is a competitor,&quot; Vance told NBC News when asked if he considers Putin an ally or enemy. &quot;But I think that we also have to be smart about diplomacy, too. Just because we don&apos;t like somebody, doesn&apos;t mean that we can&apos;t occasionally engage in conversations with them.&quot; Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&apos;s relationship with Putin has been the subject of increased scrutiny in light of recent allegations that he held multiple phone calls with the Russian president after leaving the White House. Trump frequently touts his good relationship with Putin on the campaign trail and has blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion while failing to mention Putin. He has repeatedly called Zelensky a &quot;salesman&quot; who needs to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia. Vance went on to say in the interview that negotiations with Moscow are &quot;a necessary part&quot; of ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;I think it&apos;s important if we&apos;re ever going to end the war in Ukraine, fundamentally, at some level, we&apos;re going to have to engage in some sort of negotiation between Ukraine, between Russia, between our NATO allies in Europe,&quot; he said. Vance did not detail any potential outcomes of those negotiations, but has previously said Trump&apos;s peace plan could include establishing a so-called &quot;demilitarized zone&quot; between Ukraine and Russia, presumably resembling the current line of demarcation between the countries. Zelensky called Vance&apos;s plan &quot;too radical&quot; and said he did not accept plans to end the war that came at Ukraine&apos;s expense. Vance has said multiple times that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-declines-to-call-putin-enemy-calls-for-negotiations-with-russia/	2024-10-27T11:44:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176025411.jpg
Georgian president does not recognize election results, calls for protests	Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said on Oct. 27 that she will not recognize the results of the country&apos;s recent parliamentary elections and called for citizens to join her in mass demonstrations. The ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party won a majority in the Oct. 26 vote, according to Georgia&apos;s electoral commission. Pro-EU parties have disputed the result, and European monitors also said the elections were characterized by intimidation and irregularities. &quot;I do not recognize these elections,&quot; President Zourabichvili said in a press conference on Oct. 27, as reported by the Echo of the Caucasus. &quot;These elections cannot be recognized. This is the same as recognizing Georgia&apos;s subordination to Russia. ... No one can take away Georgia&apos;s European future.&quot; Zourabichvili called the result a &quot;total falsification&quot; and described the election as a &quot;Russian special operation.&quot; She urged citizens to join her at Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Rustaveli Avenue to protest the falsified election. &quot;We must stand together and declare that we do not recognize these elections, we do not tolerate Russia and its invasion of Georgia in this form,&quot; she said. &quot;We will stand together. ... I would like to invite you all to Rustaveli tomorrow, at 7 p.m., so that we can say together, declare to the whole world that we do not recognize these elections, we are defending constitutional rights.&quot; The president&apos;s words echo those of former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, an opposition leader, who said that the results &quot;do not reflect the will of the Georgian people&quot; and called for &quot;reasonable forms of protest&quot; to &quot;defend the European future&quot; of the country. The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow and hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. The passing of the foreign agents bill sparked widespread protests across the country. The party also said it would seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili, and other opposition groups. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. European election observers also noted concerns with Georgia&apos;s electoral process. &quot;During our observation, we noted the cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in rural areas,&quot; said Ioan Bulai, the head of the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). &quot;The presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations, and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters, led to the atmosphere of pressure and party-organized intimidation.&quot; Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-president-does-not-recognize-election-calls-for-protests/	2024-10-27T11:20:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180328725.jpg

Georgian elections accompanied by vote buying, intimidation, European monitors say	The Georgian parliamentary elections were marred by intimidation and irregularities before and during the vote, European monitors said on Oct. 27 after the ruling party claimed victory. The country&apos;s electoral commission said the ruling Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won 53.9% in the Oct. 26 vote that was described as pivotal for Georgia&apos;s EU aspirations. Some pro-EU opposition parties refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. &quot;During our observation, we noted the cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in rural areas,&quot; said Ioan Bulai, the head of the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). &quot;The presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations, and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters, led to the atmosphere of pressure and party-organized intimidation.&quot; Pascal Allizard, who led the mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), undesrcored &quot;imbalances in financial resources, a divisive campaign atmosphere, and recent legislative amendments were of significant concern throughout this election process.&quot; Allizard said the legal framework for the elections was &quot;adequate&quot; and the vote was &quot;largely peaceful,&quot; though recent amendments reversed some previous positive changes. Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, the head of the European Parliament delegation, said that the &quot;ruling party used anti-Western and hostile rhetoric, targeting Georgia&#x2019;s democratic partners, in particular the European Union, its politicians and diplomats, promoted Russian disinformation, manipulation, and conspiracy theories.&quot; &quot;Reports of irregularities in Georgian elections give rise to grave concern,&quot; Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on X. The German Foreign Ministry declared that it &quot;fully supports preliminary findings &amp; conclusions&quot; of the OSCE mission and is &quot;concerned about the reported tense environment and irregularities.&quot; &quot;The handling of the election outcome &amp; government formation will also affect the future progress of Georgia on its European path,&quot; the ministry said on social media. In turn, Georgian Dream has received congratulations from several world leaders, including neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia, while Russian and Hungarian officials have praised the results. The Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups that won 10.9% of the vote, said it would not &quot;legitimize votes stolen from Georgian citizens&quot; by taking up their parliamentary mandates. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze dismissed the opposition&apos;s protests and said the parliament would approve the government nonetheless. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has seen the South Caucasus country drift ever closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. The ruling party said it would also seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili, and other opposition groups. The introduction and passing of the foreign agents bill has sparked widespread protests across the country, both in March 2023 and in May this year. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was also held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, one week before the elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-elections-accompanied-by-vote-buying-intimidation-international-observers-say/	2024-10-27T09:08:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181116623.jpg
Russia mulls 'various responses' if West aids Ukraine with long-range strikes, Putin says	The Russian Defense Ministry is considering &quot;various options&quot; as a response if Ukraine launches long-range strikes against Russia with Western support, Russian President Vladimir Putin told state media in an interview published on Oct. 27. The Kremlin&apos;s chief has reiterated his threats to the West if it takes this step, claiming that Ukraine would be able to launch such attacks only with the direct involvement of NATO military personnel. The Ukrainian military has received long-range missiles like the American ATACMS, British Storm Shadow, or French SCALP/T but is not permitted to use them on Russian soil. Ukraine has called on its allies to lift restrictions on the use of Western-provided weapons, a step that has also been included in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-step victory plan. &quot;We will have to respond to this accordingly,&quot; Putin said. &quot;Our military leadership is considering this and will present various options in response.&quot; Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Despite rumors in September that Washington and London are considering easing the restrictions, the ban has remained in place. Putin claimed already then that the move would &quot;mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries&quot; in the war and threatened a response.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-west-over-long-range-strikes/	2024-10-27T08:19:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178238738.jpg
Zelensky open to integrating China's, Brazil's proposals into peace formula, Yermak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to listen to peace initiatives from China, Brazil, South Africa, and other countries and eventually integrate them into Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published on Oct. 27. Ukraine will finalize its formula by early November and will be open to incorporating other initiatives by then, Yermak told the Italian newspaper. &quot;At that point, our proposal will have significant support,&quot; he added. The statement comes as an apparent shift from Zelensky&apos;s earlier position. Last month, the president blasted the six-point proposal drafted by Brazil and China as &quot;destructive&quot; China and Brazil proposed the plan in parallel to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which includes Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine, the release of captives, restoration of territorial integrity, and more. The document served as a basis for the global peace summit held in Switzerland in June. Russia was not invited to attend, but Ukrainian officials aim to invite Russian representatives to a second summit to present them with a peace plan developed by Ukraine and international partners. Asked about the Kremlin&apos;s views on Ukraine&apos;s peace plan, Yermak said he &quot;doesn&apos;t care what the aggressor says.&quot; Russia has not shown interest in participating in the second summit and has dismissed Zelensky&apos;s peace formula. Talking to state television on Oct. 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he does not plan &quot;any concessions&quot; and that any peace agreement must favor Moscow. &quot;We will be ready to hold the international conference when we feel strong and supported, also by the Global South, to negotiate with Russia,&quot; Yermak commented. He said he is unsure whether the conference will have to be postponed until next year but voiced hope it will be organized &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult position as Russian forces keep advancing in the country&apos;s east, and a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after the Nov. 5 election sparks fears of the U.S. pulling its support. Yermak said Kyiv is not afraid of the U.S. vote results, proclaiming, &quot;I don&apos;t think any American leader wants to facilitate the victory of an autocracy like Russia.&quot; The Presidential Office chief reminded that Zelensky met U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party&apos;s candidate for the election, as well as Trump, during his visit to the U.S. last month. &quot;I was there, I won&apos;t give details... but I can say that we returned from the United States certain that neither candidate is willing to let Putin win this war and that military support will continue,&quot; Yermak said in the interview. The Ukrainian official was also asked about the supposed centralization of power under the Presidential Office and the dismissals of popular figures like former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi or ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. &quot;There were very internal considerations, which few know,&quot; Yermak said. &quot;We need colleagues who remain totally available for their work; it is a total physical and moral effort.&quot; Zaluzhnyi was replaced by Oleksandr Syrskyi in February after rumors of a growing rift between the commander and the Presidential Office. Kuleba was dismissed in early September amid a wide-reaching government reshuffle and replaced by Andrii Sybiha, Yermak&apos;s former deputy. Yermak, who has led Zelensky&apos;s office since February 2020, has been described as &quot;arguably the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history&quot; and criticized for accumulating power within the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-china-brazil-peace-proposal/	2024-10-27T07:40:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030107886.jpg
Russia had 'partial success' at Levadne but Ukraine holds dominant heights, military says	Ukrainian forces continue to hold all the dominant heights near Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and are attempting to restore their positions, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 27. The spokesperson said this in reaction to a recent report by the Ukrainian monitoring service DeepState, which claimed that Russian forces had captured the settlement. The Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, just as it continues its drive in the Donbas region in Ukraine&apos;s east. Voloshyn said he would not call Levadne a settlement but a simple &quot;point in an open field&quot; positioned in a lowland, which makes it difficult to defend. The estimated Russian advance at the administrative borders of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts as of Oct. 26, 2024, according to DeepState. The settlement of Levadne highlighted by a black mark. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The spokesperson acknowledged that Russian forces have focused great efforts in the sector, achieving &quot;partial success&quot; and driving a wedge into Ukrainian defenses. He did not say explicitly whether the entire Levadne was captured, as DeepState reported. According to Voloshyn, Russia has intensified its operations in the area after capturing the Donetsk Oblast town of Vuhledar at the beginning of October. Levadne is located near the administrative borders of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Vuhledar and 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the city of Zaporizhzhia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-holds-key-positions-at-levadne-military-says/	2024-10-27T06:40:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1733436357.jpg
Ukraine to hold elections 'immediately after war,' Zelensky's chief of staff says	Ukraine will hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war to allow all soldiers and refugees to vote, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published on Oct. 27. &quot;(President Volodymyr) Zelensky is very clear; he wants all soldiers and refugees abroad to be able to vote,&quot; Yermak told the Italian newspaper. &quot;But for now, resources must go to the war.&quot; Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Zelensky, who has held the office since May 2019, said in December 2023 that he is ready to hold the presidential election, but most Ukrainians think such a vote would be &quot;dangerous and meaningless&quot; in wartime. His statement was supported by several polls, with 70% of Ukrainians saying Zelensky should remain in office until the end of martial law. Russia and various anti-Ukrainian voices have sought to utilize the postponement of elections to cast doubt on the country&apos;s commitment to democracy and undermine the president&apos;s legitimacy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-hold-elections-immediately-after-war/	2024-10-27T05:31:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of murdering 2, injuring 1 civilian in embattled Selydove	Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have likely opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said on Oct. 27. Selydove is the site of heavy battles as Russian forces are pushing deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crime investigation into footage and reports shared on social media that accuse Russian soldiers of shooting at and murdering the town&apos;s residents. One video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire against a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. One resident was injured and was provided assistance by Ukrainian soldiers who arrived at the scene afterward, the prosecutor&apos;s office said.

(Prosecutor General&apos;s Office/Facebook)In a separate incident, two women have been reportedly murdered by Russian troops. The bodies have been found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, the prosecutors said, citing media reports and open sources. An investigation to establish circumstances and perpetrators is underway, the statement read. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. There have been numerous reports of murder and torture of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war as Moscow continues its all-out war and holds roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Earlier this week, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-shooting-civilians-selydove/	2024-10-27T04:49:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Photo-Selydove.jpg
Ukraine's FM visits South Africa to conclude his Mideast, Africa tour	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha arrived in South Africa on Oct. 27 for a two-day visit to meet his South African counterpart Ronald Lamola and other top officials and public leaders. The visit to Johannesburg and Pretoria will conclude Sybiha&apos;s tour across the Middle East and the African continent as he seeks to strengthen ties and drum up support for Ukraine&apos;s peace formula. Apart from government officials, Ukraie&apos;s chief diplomat will also meet South African business leaders and the expert community, namely the research and teaching staff of the University of Pretoria, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The discussions will focus on Ukraine-South Africa cooperation, the role of the peace formula &quot;as a single path to a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace,&quot; and relations with South Africa as the presiding member of the G20 in 2025. South Africa, the largest economy on the continent, has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to strengthen its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia, China, and others, and it even carried out joint naval drills with the two countries last year. Sybiha previously visited Oman, Angola, and Egypt within the tour. His predecessor, Dmytro Kuleba, carried out four diplomatic tours across Africa as part of Kyiv&apos;s efforts to bolster ties in the Global South and challenge Russian influence abroad. Countries in the Middle East and Africa have been the main buyers of Ukrainian agricultural products. Kyiv has maintained the exports despite Russia&apos;s Black Sea blockade and threats to maritime shipping.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-south-africa/	2024-10-27T04:14:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/459035259_944440644393068_5124456779231225497_n.jpg
Georgia's government will be approved despite opposition's protests, PM says after elections	The Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 as his party declared victory in the elections. The country&apos;s electoral commission said that the ruling Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won 54% of the vote, dashing hopes of the pro-EU opposition. Georgian opposition refused to recognize the result and said the election was &quot;stolen,&quot; pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. According to official results, the opposition parties and coalitions that crossed the 5% threshold included the Coalition for Change (10.9%), United National Movement (UNM, 10.1%), Strong Georgia (8.8%), and Gakharia For Georgia (7.8%). Former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, the chair of the opposition Gakharia For Georgia party, said that the announced results &quot;do not reflect the will of the Georgian people&quot; and called for &quot;reasonable forms of protest&quot; to &quot;defend the European future and the institution of elections.&quot; &quot;We (will) fight for every vote, use all legal means to protect the democratic and European choice of the Georgian people,&quot; Anna Dolidze, one of the leaders of the Strong Georgia coalition, said. A coalition of Georgian observers demanded the annulment of the results over purported cases of electoral fraud, including violations of voter secrecy, use of threats, obstruction of observers, and other violations. &#xA0; Speaking at a press briefing after the elections, Kobakhidze dismissed the opposition&apos;s protests as a &quot;desperate attempt to justify themselves in front of their voters.&quot; &quot;Once again, some NGOs and radical political parties have come out against the constitutional order of the country for the third time in four years,&quot; the prime minister said. Georgian Dream has already received congratulations from several world leaders, including neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia, while Russian and Hungarian officials have praised the results. The highly anticipated elections are pivotal for Georgia. The ruling party has seen the South Caucasus country drift ever closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi has been accused of democratic backsliding over the adoption of controversial legislation, namely the foreign agents law targeting NGOs and independent media. The ruling party said it would also seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili. The introduction and passing of the foreign agents bill has sparked widespread protests across the country, both in March 2023 and in May this year. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was also held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, one week before the elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-government-elections/	2024-10-27T03:32:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181106582.jpg
Germany, France skeptical about bypassing Hungary's veto on EU aid for Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Germany and France are raising doubts about the EU diplomatic service&apos;s proposal to circumvent Hungary&apos;s veto of 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in defense assistance for Kyiv, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 25, citing undisclosed sources. Budapest has been blocking the disbursement of Kyiv-bound assistance under the European Peace Facility (EPF) for more than a year, causing frustration among other member states. The European External Action Service, the bloc&apos;s diplomatic arm, suggested that member states could make voluntary contributions, allowing the military aid to flow based on decisions of individual countries rather than unanimous consensus. Bloomberg wrote that Paris and Berlin are worried that such a move could endanger the EPF&apos;s role as the EU&apos;s foreign policy tool. As some countries require parliamentary approval for the contribution, this could further complicate and delay the process. The EPF has been a key tool for supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities since 2022 but had been largely depleted earlier this year as member states disagreed on the best way to replenish it and unlock further cash for Ukraine. While the EU approved an additional 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) for Ukraine in the spring, Budapest has been blocking their disbursement. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, seen as the most Kremlin-friendly leader in the bloc, has repeatedly stalled EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Russia. Tensions between Budapest and Brussels escalated during Hungary&apos;s rotating presidency, with EU member states and institutions boycotting Hungarian-held events over Orban&apos;s visit to Moscow in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-france-hungary-veto/	2024-10-27T02:36:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177631842.jpg
Russia claims downing 51 Ukrainian drones, fire reported at oil facility	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported downing 51 Ukrainian drones overnight on Oct. 27, with 18 of them intercepted over western Tambov Oblast. Drones struck the Michurinsky district of the region at around 0:40 a.m. local time, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, Governor Maxim Egorov claimed on his Telegram channel. The Astra Telegram channel alleged that the fire broke out at the Transneft Druzhba control station in the village of Novonikolskoye. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Transneft Druzhba is a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s leading state-controlled oil company, Transneft. It operates the Druzhba pipeline, built to funnel Russian oil to European countries via Belarus and Ukraine. The Michurinsky Oil Refinery is also located in the village of Novonikolskoye. Ukraine has carried out long-range drone strikes into Russian territory, often targeting oil refineries and depots to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and diminish Moscow&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues, crucial for funding the war. Russia claimed its forces had also downed 16 drones over Belgorod Oblast, four each over Bryansk, Lipetsk, and Oryol oblasts, three over Voronezh Oblast, and one over Kursk Oblast. Other Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down over the Azov Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-downing-51-ukrainian-drones-fire-reported-at-oil-facility/	2024-10-27T01:46:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2059253115.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 19 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed five people and injured 19 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 27. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 41 of the 80 Russian Shahed-type drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-two drones were lost on Ukrainian territory, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement read. Around 10 attack drones were downed on the outskirts of Kyiv in another drone attack against the capital. No casualties were reported, but the fallen debris damaged a house and two cars in the region. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed two people and injured nine, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported.

Ukraine, India discuss strengthening defense industry cooperation	Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin met with India&apos;s Ambassador to Ukraine Ravi Shankar on Oct. 26 to discuss strengthening defense industry cooperation between Kyiv and New Delhi, the Strategic Industries Ministry announced. &quot;Ukraine is open to expanding the scope of partnerships in the defense sector, and we are ready to consider various forms of collaboration,&quot; Smetanin said in a statement released by the Strategic Industries Ministry. &quot;It is important to assess the capabilities and needs of both our countries&apos; defense industries, to identify challenges, and to determine the course we will take.&quot; The meeting follows discussions between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in late September aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two countries. Zelensky and Modi discussed trade, economic and defense cooperation, India&apos;s involvement in Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction, and collaboration in educational, scientific, and cultural initiatives, according to the statement by the president&apos;s office. Ukraine and India approved four cooperation agreements in August during Modi&apos;s first visit to Ukraine. The parties did not disclose the details of the deals. &quot;I welcome the proposal to expand cooperation in the defense industries and assure the Minister of the Embassy&apos;s support in defining specific proposals,&quot; said Shankar, following the meeting. No details were provided on the specifics of the discussions. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023. Ahead of Modi&apos;s first visit to Kyiv in August, the Indian prime minister visited Moscow where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv, killing two people.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-india-discuss-defense-industry/	2024-10-26T19:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/1729960305177.png
Ukrainian-Canadian filmmakers pull out from film festival after being featured alongside 'Russians at War'	Ukrainian-Canadian filmmakers pulled their pro-Ukrainian film &quot;Intercepted&quot; from screening at the Windsor International Film Festival (WIFF) after learning that it would be featured in a lineup alongside the controversial &quot;Russians at War&quot; documentary, the Canadian media outlet Windsor Star reported on Oct. 26. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova&apos;s documentary Russians at War has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. Earlier in her career, Trofimova worked for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet. The documentary has been criticized for lacking a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, failing to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Putin&apos;s regime. The movie was brought into the spotlight when it appeared on the official list of screenings at the prestigious Venice and Toronto film festivals. According to the Windsor Star, Intercepted &#x2014; a film that chronicles the work of Ukrainian intelligence agencies as it intercepts calls from Russian soldiers to family and friend &#x2014; pulled out of the Canadian-based WIFF ahead of its opening night screening. The decision to pull out comes amid widespread protest among Canada&apos;s large Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora. Following protest, organizers at the Toronto International Film Festival decided to pull the film from the schedule, citing security concerns, but later decided to hold a special screening for the film after the end of the festival in September, drawing widespread criticism. Controversy further spread as it was revealed the Russians at War film received $340,000 from the Canada Media Fund. Canadian government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, have strongly criticized the use of public funds to support a controversial documentary that portrays Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Despite protest from local members of the Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora, WIFF has not removed Russians at War from the festival&apos;s lineup &#x2014; at odds with decisions made earlier this month at film festivals in Athens and Zurich to drop the film. The director of Intercepted, Oksana Karpovych, could not be immediately reached by the Windsor Star for comment. On Oct. 7, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) began investigating Trofimova on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-canadian-filmmakers-pull-out-from-film-festival-after-being-featured-alongside-russians-at-war/	2024-10-26T17:19:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170326498.jpg
Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins Europe’s women's Athlete of the Year award	Olympic gold medalist Yaroslava Muhuchikh took home the title of Europe&#x2019;s women&apos;s Athlete of the Year at the 2024 European Athletics Golden Tracks Awards ceremony on Oct. 26. The 23-year-old high jumper won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the women&apos;s high jump event following a jump of 2.00 meters on Aug. 4. Mahuchikh, originally from Dnipro, currently holds the world record for women&apos;s high jump at 2.10 meters and was named world champion in the event in August 2023.

Zelensky signs law allowing foreigners to serve as officers in International Legion	President Volodymyr Zelensky formally signed a bill on Oct. 25 allowing foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion to serve as officers. Until now, volunteers could &#x43E;nly fight as privates or sergeants. Zelensky finalized the passage of the bill after Ukraine&apos;s parliament unanimously adopted amendments to the draft law that led to the changes. Ukraine&apos;s International Legion was launched at the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attracting foreigners who volunteered to defend Ukraine. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. The Legion is comprised of two units, one under the jurisdiction of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the other subordinated to the military intelligence agency (HUR). Initially lauded as a PR success, soon it was marred with scandals and stories about misconduct. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigation from 2022 revealed leadership misconduct in the unit, both in the parts led by military intelligence and those overseen by the Armed Forces. The passage of the bill comes as Ukrainian officials have declared the situation on the front line as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; In recent weeks, North Korean soldiers have appeared training alongside Russian forces in the front line regions. Officials have warned, citing intelligence reports, that North Korean troops may join the fight alongside Russian forces as early as Oct. 27-28.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-allowing-foreigners-to-serve-as-officers-in-international-legion/	2024-10-26T15:11:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Ukraine forced to fight against North Korea in Europe,' Zelensky says	During his evening address on Oct. 26, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that North Korean troops may appear fighting alongside Russian forces on the front line in the coming days. &quot;(Russia is) increasingly engaging North Korea as an ally, and any day now their soldiers may appear on the battlefield fighting against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine will be forced to actually fight against North Korea in Europe.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid reports that the Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August. Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports, that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. Speaking during his evening address, Zelensky called on Western allies to commit to &quot;stronger decisions in support of Ukraine,&quot; as the threat of the war&apos;s escalation continues to rise. &quot;The world is capable of stopping the war from unfolding. Abstractions and words are not enough for this &#x2013; concrete steps are needed.&quot; On Oct. 24, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that the country could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities.&quot; South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-forced-to-fight-against-north-korea-in-europe-zelensky-says/	2024-10-26T14:04:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Georgian ruling party secures majority with 70% of precincts counted, official results show	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Georgia&#x2019;s ruling Georgian Dream party captured 53% of the vote in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, with 70% of precincts counted, according to the country&apos;s central electoral commission. The commission reported that the final voter turnout reached 58.94%. Some 3.5 million Georgians were eligible to cast ballots in the polls. Meanwhile, the opposition claimed victory in the election. The European Union has cautioned that this election will shape Georgia&#x2019;s prospects for joining the 27-nation bloc. Polls indicate that most Georgians support EU membership, but accession talks stalled after Georgian Dream passed a law in June that restricts freedom of speech. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ruling-party-secures-majority-with-70-of-precincts-counted-official-results-show/	2024-10-26T12:07:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180430600-1.jpg
Ukraine hopes Washington will support Kyiv's NATO bid after elections, as opposition in Europe persists	The desire to receive an official invitation to NATO tops President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan. While acknowledging that membership itself is a matter for after the war, Zelensky urged allies to send an invitation before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in January. The president also said that Ukraine needs to receive an invitation without conditions to cede territory, denying earlier reports that Kyiv might be invited to the alliance without the occupied parts of the country, such as Donetsk and Crimea. But despite the ambitious request, there seems to be little appetite for a fast-tracked invitation while the war is ongoing. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz proclaimed that NATO cannot &quot;become a party of war.&quot; Even if Kyiv sways the hesitant heavyweights &#x2013; U.S. and Germany &#x2013; Ukraine-skeptic governments in Hungary and Slovakia remain a vocal obstacle. In total, at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, Politico reported on Oct. 23. Even if that hurdle is overcome, further down the road lies a drawn-out accession process that requires ratification by all the 32 parliaments. &quot;We are talking about a very, very long future,&quot; Volodymyr Ogrysko, Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv applied for membership in September 2022 as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion was in full swing. Despite Ukraine knocking on the door for two years, the alliance has been hesitant to give a clear signal. Ogrysko was nevertheless crystal clear about why Ukraine needs full membership: &quot;Otherwise, it will be only an invitation for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to repeat this in one or two years&#x2026;And I don&apos;t know why our Western colleagues really do not understand that.&quot; &quot;I would say that at best, extending an invitation could potentially happen relatively quickly following a favorable U.S. election,&quot; Camille Grand, a security and NATO expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Formal accession would follow the post-hot phase of the conflict,&quot; he added. The Vilnius Summit communique from last year stated that Ukraine would &quot;join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.&quot; This vague promise was reiterated this year during the allied gathering in Washington, though it was &quot;upgraded&quot; by saying that Ukraine&apos;s path toward NATO is &quot;irreversible.&quot; These lukewarm pledges come as little surprise. As the allies remain divided on the issue, the 32-member consensus necessary for inviting and admitting a new member remains far off. Kyiv&apos;s NATO prospects have received clear support from at least some allies, namely those on the eastern flank like Poland and the Baltic states. &quot;We see confident support from France. We understand that Britain will support us, and we believe that Italy will as well,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing on Oct. 21 attended by the Kyiv Independent. The president nevertheless acknowledged reluctance from some members. The U.S. and Germany, NATO&apos;s largest economies and leading suppliers of military assistance to Ukraine, have represented the main opposition to Kyiv&apos;s fast accession. While Washington was once the leading force behind NATO enlargement, the Biden administration took a much more careful approach, which some observers ascribe to the president&apos;s &quot;Cold War mentality&quot; and fears of an escalation with Russia.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/ AFP via Getty Images)And even if Biden were to change his position, &quot;there remains&#x2026;real opposition coming from Hungary but also countries more supportive of Ukraine, (such) as Germany,&quot; Grand said. &quot;I, therefore&#x2026; do not expect an invitation to be granted in the short term, even though I believe it would be a powerful signal,&quot; the expert noted. Speaking after meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he hopes for a more &quot;positive reaction&quot; from Washington after the election. He also believes that U.S. support could nudge other reluctant parties, such as Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary, in a more positive direction. There have been conflicting reports on the current mood in Washington. While the French outlet Le Monde wrote that Biden might be open to an invitation if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election in November. Politico reports that the opposition on the other side of the Atlantic persists. Getting Washington on board would certainly put strong pressure on other members but would not ensure an immediate invitation. In Berlin, the mood is tepid at best. Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, the chancellor dismissed the &#xA0;appeal for an immediate invitation, adding that a &quot;country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;German skepticism about our joining NATO is a fact,&quot; Zelensky acknowledged. Finally, there are the wildcards of Hungary and Slovakia, both led by populist leaders who have repeatedly criticized military assistance for Ukraine over fears of being dragged into the war. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Zelensky&apos;s victory plan &quot;terrifying,&quot; his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico vowed that he would block Ukraine&apos;s membership as long as he is in office.

(Tobias Schwarz / AFP via Getty Images)But experience shows that despite fiery rhetoric, Bratislava has rarely broken Western consensus on key policy issues. Budapest did, along with Turkey, block the accession of Finland and Sweden but eventually withdrew its opposition after gaining some benefits. &quot;I can imagine that Hungary will make some requests regarding the Hungarian minority in (Ukraine&apos;s) Zakarpattia Oblast,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. In a similar fashion, Budapest has used the 75,000-large Hungarian minority in Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region to hamper Kyiv&apos;s EU accession. &quot;Of course, we know how it went with Sweden and Finland&#x2026; in the end, it was only a matter of time before the pressure from the alliance was too strong,&quot; Havlicek added, noting that Bratislava is even less likely to put up real resistance due to its security dependence on the U.S. Nevertheless, Budapest has more reasons to obstruct Ukraine&apos;s invitation and entry than it did with the two Nordic countries. &quot;As criticism of Ukraine and the pro-peace narrative have become such core parts of Fidesz&apos;s (Hungary&apos;s ruling party) politics, it is much harder to imagine that the current Hungarian National Assembly would ratify Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO,&quot; says Patrik Szicherle, a research fellow at the Globsec think tank. &quot;This does not mean Hungary would never agree, but I think it would take a longer time to convince the public that it would benefit Hungary.&quot; According to Politico&apos;s sources, other countries, like Belgium, Slovenia, or Spain, are also averse to a quick invite for Ukraine but are less vocal about it, hiding in Berlin and Washington&apos;s shadow. &quot;Unfortunately, I think that the political support within NATO is not strong enough at this time,&quot; said James Goldgeier, a professor at the American University in Washington D.C. and an expert on NATO enlargement. Voicing skepticism about Biden actually changing his position, Goldgeier added: &quot;The biggest question is what approach would a Harris administration take if she were to win the election. I don&apos;t think we know that yet.&quot; Harris did not publicly commit to pushing Ukraine&apos;s NATO bid forward. Nor did her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, whose potential return to the White House prompts fears of the U.S. decreasing or canceling its support of Ukraine. Even if Kyiv manages to muster support among all 32 members, Zelensky acknowledged that the actual membership will have to wait until the end of the war. The military outcome of the full-scale war is unclear, but the current situation seems to favor Russia and makes it unlikely that Ukraine will be able to liberate all of its territories in the near future. While Ukraine&apos;s allies have publicly avowed commitment to its territorial integrity, the present situation led to some speculations about more &quot;realistic&quot; pathways toward NATO membership. Speaking to the Financial Times, former NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg proposed a &quot;West German solution,&quot; suggesting that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 could extend only to territories held by Kyiv. The areas occupied by Russia would be de facto left outside of the alliance without officially acknowledging them as Russian. Some media reports also suggested that some in the West are considering the possibility of Ukraine temporarily trading its territory for NATO membership. Talking to the Kyiv Independent, Grand said that while he fully supports Ukraine restoring its territorial integrity, &quot;full control over the entire territory should, however, not be a prerequisite for joining NATO.&quot; A soldier looks at a fire caused by artillery fire in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on July 29, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)The expert said that the West Germany solution &quot;proved a good decision for the Alliance, for Germany and for European security&quot; and &quot;some lessons of this experience could apply to Ukraine.&quot; Others, like historian Timothy Garton Ash, pointed out differences in the German and Ukrainian starting points. Unlike Russian-occupied Ukraine, East Germany was not being &quot;brutally Russified,&quot; he wrote in an op-ed in the Financial Times. Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center, said such a decision would not be the most &quot;favorable scenario,&quot; but it is not unfeasible if the allies provide enough military power to back it up. He also mollified fears that accepting Ukraine into NATO would automatically mandate the allies to put boots on the ground. Extending the invitation and accepting Ukraine would be powerful by itself as it would impose strategic uncertainty on the Kremlin: &quot;We don&apos;t have to (send our soldiers). But we have the right at any moment to do so.&quot; Indeed, Article 5 requires the allies merely to take &quot;such action as (they) deem necessary&quot; to safeguard collective security but does not dictate a full-blown military response. At least publicly, Kyiv has been adamant that it will not compromise on territory or sovereignty. Commenting on the possibility of entering NATO without occupied territories, Zelensky said that &quot;no matter what path we take, legally, no one will recognize the occupied territories as territories of other states.&quot; The Ukrainian president noted that he was not approached directly with the NATO-for-territory proposals but believes some partners are sending these signals through the media. &quot;I think that in this case, everything depends on Ukrainian society,&quot; Zelensky said. A survey conducted in May 2024 showed that 55% of Ukrainians opposed territorial concession. While still constituting a majority, it was a drop from 65% and 74% in February 2024 and December 2023. In the same poll, roughly half of the respondents were open to the possibility of Russia de facto holding on to some occupied territories if Ukraine can join NATO and gain real security guarantees. Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk said that if NATO is actually considering the West German scenario, it needs to make the offer officially, but it must also understand how Russia would react to such a step.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hopes-washington-will-support-kyivs-nato-bid-after-elections-as-opposition-in-europe-persists/	2024-10-26T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Both sides declare victory in Georgia's pivotal vote on European future	Competing exit polls indicate that Georgia&#x2019;s increasingly authoritarian ruling party, Georgian Dream, is positioned to lead in a crucial election on the nation&#x2019;s European future. However, the polls diverge on which side could secure a majority. The ruling Georgian Dream party, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, and opposition groups aiming to end the party&#x2019;s 12-year rule declared victory on Oct. 26. Opposition-aligned TV channels reported Georgian Dream with 40.9% of the vote, while the combined total for four opposition groups was at 51.9%. Meanwhile, the pro-government Imedi TV gave Georgian Dream a higher 56%. Under Georgia&#x2019;s updated electoral system, the party with at least half the vote claims half of the 150 seats in parliament. Although Georgia achieved EU candidate status last December, the European Union has since suspended the process due to &quot;democratic backsliding&quot; and the passage of a Russian-style &quot;foreign influence&quot; law targeting groups receiving Western funding. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media. Large numbers of Georgians participated in the election on Oct. 26, despite reports of violence near polling stations. Two people were hospitalized, and Georgian Dream supporters attacked the headquarters of the main opposition party, BBC reported. In one incident, an opposition official south of Tbilisi told the BBC he was first assaulted by a local Georgian Dream council member and then by &quot;another 10 men came and I didn&#x2019;t know what was happening to me.&quot; The opposition has framed this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe and Russia. Should the exit polls favoring the opposition prove accurate, they could end Georgian Dream&#x2019;s 12-year tenure. Final projected results are expected soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/both-sides-declare-victory-in-georgias-pivotal-vote-on-european-future/	2024-10-26T10:16:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180410629.jpg
Final pre-election push to boost ‘heartland’ US support for Ukraine proves difficult	PARMA, Ohio &#x2014; After serving nearly three months in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, a unit within the country&#x2019;s army comprised of fighters from abroad, Manus McCaffery is known as a hometown hero in Parma, Ohio, home to one of the largest diaspora communities in the U.S. with roots from Ukraine. Months into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in 2022, the now 23-year-old U.S. veteran was wounded in Ukraine&#x2019;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He dedicated the subsequent years to another way of supporting Ukraine &#x2013; by fundraising for its armed forces in Parma. As part of his mission to expand support for Ukraine among fellow Ohio conservatives, McCaffery joined a discussion organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Parma this October, less than a month from the U.S. presidential election. The event was part of the fund&#x2019;s &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine&#x201D; tour, a year-long effort to rally support for Kyiv. A Parma, Ohio veteran who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s foreign legion, Manus McCaffery (C) remains undecided on his vote for the U.S. president on Nov. 5. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Yet even McCaffery himself is torn over how he will vote in the Nov. 5 election: for the status quo in terms of U.S. backing for Ukraine, namely President Joe Biden&apos;s Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic Party ticket, or Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has openly questioned further allyship with Kyiv and has a history of fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m extremely uncertain, it&#x2019;s tough because I want to balance what I think is best for America, but also, in a lot of ways, I&apos;m a one-issue person because I care about Ukraine so much,&#x201D; McCaffery told the Kyiv Independent. It would have been easier, he added, for him to vote for Biden over Harris, who he says is too progressive on domestic issues. The veteran of Ukraine and U.S. armed services said his vote would be a last-minute decision. With the U.S. presidential election days away and 40% of Trump supporters saying Washington should &#x201C;reconsider&#x201D; its level of backing for Ukraine, the Ohio stop showed how challenging the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s mission of increasing support for Ukraine is. Since last November, the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based research group that promotes democracy, has visited eight &#x201C;heartland&#x201D; U.S. states in a public diplomacy initiative dubbed &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine.&#x201D; The tour has primarily focused on Democratic city centers surrounded by conservative rural areas and ideologically diverse suburbs like Denver, Colorado, Des Moines, Iowa, and Erie, Pennsylvania. &#xA0; Heather Conley, a senior advisor to the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s board who led the tour, described each stop on the tour as a &#x201C;unique set of conversations and meetings&#x201D; that involve outreach to community business leaders and farming communities. The tour had previously included the Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova. But as the topic of aid to Ukraine has become increasingly politicized in the past months, she was absent from the most recent stop in Ohio. &#xA0; Republican Mike Johnson, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a close Trump ally, openly called this autumn for Volodymyr Zelensky to fire Markarova after the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s recent visit to a Pennsylvania artillery ammunition factory producing weaponry for his armed forces. The state&#x2019;s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the visit, but there was no representation from the Republican Party. &#xA0; Conley said Markarova wasn&#x2019;t part of the Ohio stop due to the sensitivity of Ukraine&#x2019;s topic so close to the U.S. election. &#x201C;After Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to the U.S., (the Ukrainian Embassy) wanted to be, understandably, more cautious,&#x201D; Conley said. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s last stop before the election and second to last overall comprised one day of engagements in northeast Ohio. Once a swing state, Ohio has reliably voted Republican since 2016. It is also home to the Republican party&#x2019;s Ukraine-skeptical vice presidential nominee JD Vance and nearly 12 million voters, offering a ripe electorate to expand conservative support of Ukraine. Around 60,000 Ukrainians live in the state, including nearly 10,000 who have relocated since Russis&#x2019;a full-scale invasion, according to Global Cleveland. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s Ohio visit included a tour of a Ukrainian daycare, a roundtable with local Ukrainian and religious leaders, and a conversation with local U.S. veterans. Flanked by the Democratic-leaning city of Cleveland to its north and rural Ohio to its south, the city hall of Parma, Ohio, has raised the Ukrainian flag since the early days of the full-scale invasion. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Home to Ohio&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian population, Parma, Ohio has continuous reminders of its support from Ukrainian flag-painted fire hydrants to street posts. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)With the largest concentration of Ukrainians in northeast Ohio, the whistlestop had no problem finding passionate defenders of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. However, some attendees said many voters in Parma are hesitant to support Ukraine. One Parma resident, who is known locally for being an outspoken Republican for Ukraine, said he will &#x201C;begrudgingly have to vote for Trump&#x201D; because of the economy, despite believing &#x201C;Ukraine is screwed with a Trump administration.&#x201D; The Republican voter, who like others spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity for privacy concerns, said his support of Ukraine&#x2019;s independence is a conflicting issue for his vote, as he wishes a pro-Ukraine Republican like Nikki Haley, the Trump&#x2019;s former ambassador to the United Nations, was on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end Russia&#x2019;s war in 24 hours, without going into details about how he is planning to achieve that. Due to his consistent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine and friendly ties with the Kremlin, many fear that Trump&#x2019;s plan may involve forcing Ukraine to make territorial concessions and agree to a peace deal on unfair terms. Yet even some Ukrainians in Parma appear to have bought into Trump&#x2019;s message that he will end the war immediately should he be elected in November, earning the 78-year-old their vote. &#x201C;I talk to a lot of Ukrainians who support Trump and it almost feels like there is a bit of cognitive dissonance because they support Ukraine but they also support Trump,&#x201D; said Andriy Boechko, a Parma resident who moved from Lviv, western Ukraine, in the 1990s.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The 37-year-old registered independent says he&#x2019;ll vote for Harris as he believes Ukraine will be better off with her in office than Trump. &#x201C;I like to keep an open mind, but I&#x2019;m not a Trump supporter, definitely not, especially as far as Ukraine is concerned, I&#x2019;m a little worried about what&#x2019;s going to happen if he&#x2019;s elected,&#x201D; Boechko said. &#x201C;The most important issue is foreign policy, and I think Democrats have a better grasp on that.&#x201D; Like in other states across the U.S. that benefit from aid for Ukraine, the connection between the Biden Administration&#x2019;s foreign policy and local economic growth along with new jobs doesn&#x2019;t seem evident in Ohio. Of the $175 billion Congress has allocated for Kyiv since 2022, nearly $70 billion was poured into American manufacturing in over 70 U.S. cities, according to one analysis. Over $700 million of that sum was spent on the manufacturing economy of Ohio. Dozens of Stryker combat vehicles and M1 Abrams tanks have rolled off an Army-owned General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio before being sent to Kyiv. Ukraine has also received Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) produced by General Dynamics in Springboro, Ohio. Despite that, Lima&#x2019;s Republican representative, Jim Jordan, like Trump&#x2019;s running mate Vance, opposes aid to Ukraine. According to Boechko, the Biden Administration could expand voters&#x2019; support of Ukraine if they better communicated that not all of the money the U.S. spends on aiding Ukraine goes directly to Ukraine. Parma&#x2019;s Democratic Mayor, Tim DeGeeter, argued that the middle of the country doesn&#x2019;t trust Washington during an election season. DeGeeter, who boasts a Ukrainian flag outside city hall, asked Conley of the German Marshall Fund to help get the message out to Ohioans that supporting Ukraine is an American boon. &#x201C;Even though that war is 5,000 plus miles away, it&apos;s very close to all for us here in Parma,&#x201D; DeGeeter said.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The German Marshall Fund observed a similar lack of understanding of how aid for Ukraine benefits American communities during one of their previous stops in Erie, Pennsylvania. Erie is home to Vorex LLC and Logistics Plus, which have been expanding the local manufacturing economy by providing Ukraine with bulletproof vests and generators, respectively. According to Conley, Erie&apos;s businesses are &#x201C;critical players in America&apos;s support for Ukraine.&#x201D; The fund&#x2019;s events in Erie in May mostly attracted voters who already supported Ukraine, according to attendee Ashley Lawson, who has helped settle hundreds of Ukrainians in northwest Pennsylvania as a field director with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. &#x201C;Erie is a perfect example of a city that is critical to U.S. foreign and security policy every day &#x2014; they just might not realize it,&#x201D; Conley said. Meanwhile, in Ohio, Parma Mayor DeGeeter remains hopeful the large Ukrainian population will turn out in opposition to the Republican party, which has dominated most Ohio counties excluding those home to major metropolitan areas. &#xA0; &#x201C;The alternative (to a Harris White House), candidate Trump, is basically saying &#x2018;give up land and territory, that&#x2019;s how we can end this war,&#x2019;&#x201D; DeGeeter said. &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s kind of the goal of Putin, that&#x2019;s not a shared objective.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/in-ohio-final-push-to-increase-us-support-of-ukraine-proves-difficult-as-election-nears/	2024-10-26T08:07:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173511741.jpg
Polling station closed in southern Georgia during election following reported ballot stuffing	Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commisssion closed a polling station on Oct. 26 in the southern city of Marneuli after video footage of ballot stuffing during the parliamentary election surfaced. The Interior Ministry has also launched an investigation into the incident, Georgia media outlet SOVA reported. The investigation has been launched under Article 164 of Georgia&apos;s criminal code, concerning the &quot;falsification of elections, which provides for the deliberate falsification of election documents: voter lists, protocols, ballots, registration logs and control sheets and is punishable by up to two years of imprisonment.&quot; Nino Lomjaria, a Georgian lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported earlier on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed.

Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/polling-station-closed-in-southern-georgia-during-election-following-reported-ballot-stuffing/	2024-10-26T06:33:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2151494694.jpg
Government says 'strategically important' employees will be able to extend military exemption status	Employees in &quot;strategically important sectors of the economy&quot; will be able to extend their exemption from military conscription, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers announced on Oct. 26. Meanwhile, an audit of the exemption process is ongoing until Nov. 15 to assess which businesses qualify for critical enterprise status, reflecting the government&apos;s effort to balance the country&apos;s defense needs with economic stability. &quot;The reason for the audit is the abnormal increase in the number of critical enterprises and the number of reserved employees. This is done in the interest of strengthening the country&apos;s defense capability and preventing abuses,&quot; the Cabinet of Ministers said. Nearly one million people were eligible for exemption in mid-August, according to the Defense Ministry. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early April that he ordered relevant ministries to introduce &quot;updated, more fair&quot; rules on exempting employees of &quot;critically important&quot; companies from military service. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April in order to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. Leading up to the passing of the law, Ukraine launched Reserv+, which the government promoted as a convenient alternative to lengthy waits at enlistment offices. Another law, signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. In late 2023, Zelensky said that the military, then under General Valery Zaluzhnyi&apos;s command, requested drafting 450,000-500,000 people in the face of a prolonged war. Zaluzhyni later denied this figure.	https://kyivindependent.com/government-says-strategically-important-employees-will-be-able-to-extend-military-exemption-status/	2024-10-26T06:08:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Georgians head out to vote in parliamentary elections, tensions run high at some polling stations	Parliamentary elections in Georgia are underway on Oct. 26 which will determine if the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party will remain in power. A large rally with tens of thousands of Georgians in support of the country&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20 ahead of the vote. Georgia received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023, but questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Tensions are reportedly running high at some polling stations in the country. Nino Lomjaria, a lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed. Giorgi Kalandarishvili, chairperson of Georgia&apos;s Central Election Committe, called the video &quot;disturbing,&quot; and said that &quot;if confirmed, the election administration will not allow such managed or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of effort we have put into election day,&quot; Georgian public media reported. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Fears of Russian interference also ran high during the recent Moldovan election, with the vote for the EU referendum winning by only 11,000 votes despite polls showing clear support for closer ties to Europe. Moldovan authorities revealed that they had evidence of other 130,000 people receiving bribes from Russian-linked forces to influence the referendum vote. The second round of voting, which will see if President Maia Sandu will hold onto the presidency, is set to take place on Nov. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgians-head-out-to-vote-in-parliamentary-elections-tensions-run-high-at-some-polling-stations/	2024-10-26T05:05:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147848892.jpg
Media: US-sanctioned Gazprombank may buy Auchan chains in Russia	Gazprombank, one of Russia&apos;s largest banks that is also under heavy U.S. sanctions, is reportedly poised to acquire the Russian operations of the Auchan retail chain, according to sources cited by Le Monde on Oct. 25. Auchan, a French hypermarket chain, remains one of the last Western businesses operating in Russia after many companies exited the market following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly accounted for 10% of Auchan&apos;s global sales. Auchan CEO Yves Claude noted that 30,000 people, including 40% of employees and shareholders, could lose their jobs if the company exited the market. In March 2022, Auchan CEO Yves Claude told the outlet Journal du Dimanche that the company would not leave Russia despite accusations of financing the war, citing the need to keep employees and continue &quot;feeding the populations of both Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Yet, French media reported on Oct. 24 that Auchan was in the final negotiations to sell its Russian subsidiary to a local buyer and is expected to finalize the sale in the coming weeks. The potential buyer was not named in the previous reporting, only that Auchan was reportedly eager to sell as Russia&apos;s &quot;exit tax&quot; has increased from 10% to 15%, with the potential to reach 35%. As Le Monde noted, Gazprombank purchased the Mega shopping center chain from Ikea, which included 14 locations &#xA0;across Russian, and housed Auchan stores. Gazprombank has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014, with additional sanctions announced by the U.S. and U.K. in 2022 following the onset of the full-scale war. In January 2023, Russian state-controlled media announced that U.S. banks stopped dollar transfers for Gazprombank.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-gazprombank-may-buy-auchan-chains-in-russia/	2024-10-26T01:46:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239550139.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 687,600 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 687,600 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 26. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,109 tanks, 18,332 armored fighting vehicles, 27,460 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,782 artillery systems, 1,240 multiple launch rocket systems, 984 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,726 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-687-600-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-26T00:23:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
G7 to provide Ukraine $50 billion in loans backed by frozen Russian assets	The Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. &quot;Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year,&quot; a statement from the G7 leaders read. During the G7 summit in Italy in June, G7 leaders publicly confirmed an agreement on the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan. Officials said shortly thereafter that the plan would be finalized in October. &quot;Today, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), have reached a consensus on how to deliver approximately $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans to Ukraine,&quot; the Oct. 25 statement reads. &quot;These loans will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets, in line with G7 respective legal systems and international law. &quot; The funds will support Ukraine&apos;s economic, defense, and reconstruction needs. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called on G7 leaders to back the $50-billion plan but also urged the creation of a mechanism for the full confiscation of $300 billion in frozen Russian funds. According to media reports on Oct. 22, the G7 plans to keep the Russian assets immobilized even after the war against Ukraine ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-to-provide-ukraine-50-billion-in-loans-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-25T19:08:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Satellite images show expansion at Soviet-era bioweapons lab in Russia	Satellite imagery shows signs of a major renovation and expansion at a restricted military facility near Moscow that once housed a Cold War biological weapons program, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 25. Sergiyev Posad-6, a military site northeast of Moscow, was a Soviet biological weapons research center during the Cold War. The Soviet military used the lab to experiment with weaponizing the viruses that cause smallpox and Ebola, among others. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, satellite imagery indicated massive construction and renovation at the Sergiyev Posad-6 site, the WP reported, citing photos from imaging firms Planet Labs and Maxar. The expansion amounts to over 250,000 square feet and 10 new buildings. According to experts in biodefense, the military, and satellite imaging who spoke to the WP, the facilities harbor some of the distinctive features of high-security biological labs that handle dangerous pathogens. Among these features are extensive rooftop air handling units, underground infrastructure, heightened security, and a possible power plant. The layout is &quot;consistent with lab design&quot; and suggests &quot;maximum containment&quot; labs, one expert said. &quot;The upgrades are consistent with this secure, top-secret military biological facility&apos;s historic role in developing viral biological weapons,&quot; said Andrew Weber, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks. Russian officials have said that the purpose of the labs is to study Ebola viruses and other deadly microbes in order to protect Russia from possible bioterrorism. The expansion at Sergiyev Posad-6 coincides with a Russian disinformation campaign in the early months of the full-scale invasion, when the Kremlin falsely accused Ukraine of developing biological weapons. Officials told the WP that it is impossible to tell from the satellite photos whether Russia plans to use the Sergiyev Posad-6 labs to research and develop biological weapons. Biological warfare is banned under international law. While there is no evidence Russia has used such weapons in its war against Ukraine, Kyiv has accused Moscow of launching thousands of chemical weapons attacks during its ongoing invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly resorted to nuclear blackmail to deter Ukraine&apos;s Western allies from a more aggressive response.	https://kyivindependent.com/satellite-images-show-expansion-at-soviet-era-bioweapons-lab-in-russia/	2024-10-25T18:31:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-695215514.jpg
US reports North Korean troops moving to Russia’s Kursk region	The Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August, according to a U.S. official. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. The U.S. official&#x2019;s remarks followed National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&#x2019;s statement earlier on Oct. 25, where he noted that some North Korean troops stationed at multiple training sites in eastern Russia will likely be deployed to Kursk, though the specific purpose remains unclear. &quot;...At least some of these North Korean troops could be deployed to the Kursk area,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;But in what capacity, for what purpose, that still remains unclear.&quot; This marks the first public acknowledgment by the U.S. of its assessment that North Korean troops could soon be in Kursk, coming a day after Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence reported that the initial units trained in Russia had already moved to the region. Initially, U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reports-north-korean-troops-moving-to-russias-kursk-region/	2024-10-25T16:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Russian missile attack kills 3, injures 14 in Dnipro	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile attack struck several residential buildings and a medical facility in the central-eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro late on Oct. 25, killing three people and injuring at least 14, according to regional governor Serhii Lysak. Lysak reported that the attack left four children injured, including an eight-year-old girl and a teenage boy. One child is in critical condition. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack as some people might be trapped under the rubble, according to Lysak. Local news sources indicated that several strikes targeted different areas across the city. No other details were provided at the moment. Dnipro, Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city with a pre-war population of about one million, has served as a key logistics and humanitarian hub during the full-scale war. It is located approximately 395 kilometers (245 miles) from Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-kills-3-injures-13-in-dnipro/	2024-10-25T15:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-25-16_36_53.jpeg
North Korea says any troop deployment to Russia is in 'regulations of international law'	North Korea&#x2019;s foreign ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send its troops to support Russia in the war in Ukraine would comply with international law, however, it did not confirm whether such a deployment had occurred. Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong Gyu, in a statement shared by state news agency KCNA, remarked that if North Korea had taken such actions, they would align with international norms despite attempts by others to portray them as illegal. Russian President Vladimir Putin refrained from denying the reports, which have circulated from sources in Ukraine, South Korea, the United States, and other nations. Kyiv stresses that any North Korean involvement in Russia&apos;s war could amount to a crime of aggression under international law. Kim Jong Gyu noted that the foreign ministry does not oversee military matters, leaving such issues to the defense ministry and, therefore, refraining from specific comments on deployment. &quot;If there is such a thing that the world media is talking about, I think it will be an act conforming with the regulations of international law,&quot; he added. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. President Volodymyr Zelensky, referencing intelligence reports, said that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. The United States has also indicated seeing evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, while South Korean lawmakers estimate around 3,000 soldiers have already been sent, with more expected.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-says-any-troop-deployment-to-russia-is-in-regulations-of-international-law/	2024-10-25T14:05:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179013028.jpg
Usyk appeals to Trump to help free Azovstal defenders from Russian captivity	Ukrainian world boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk called on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Oct. 25 to influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to release the defenders of the Azovstal steel plant. The POWs, made up of the Azov regiment among soldiers from other units, became a symbol of Ukraine&apos;s resistance through their tenacious defense of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol in the first three months of the all-out war. Russian forces eventually took Mariupol in May 2022, capturing the remaining defenders after Kyiv gave an order to preserve their lives. About 700 Azov fighters remain in Russian captivity, Olena Tolkachova, the head of the patronage service of the Azov Brigade, said on national television in September. Trump will be a guest on one of internet personality Joe Rogan&apos;s upcoming podcast episodes, hence, Usyk asked the American podcaster to pass on his appeal to the former U.S. president and Republican presidential nominee. &quot;If Mr. President is so confident in his influence over Putin, could he help free Azovstal defenders and all Ukrainians from Russian captivity right away? Time is of the essence,&quot; Usyk wrote on X. Earlier, Trump said that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which is expected to decisively shape Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/usyk-appeals-to-trump-to-help-free-azovstal-defenders-from-russian-captivity/	2024-10-25T12:05:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2153592894.jpg
Russian drone hits multi-story residential building in Kyiv	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian suicide drone hit a multi-story residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district on Oct. 25, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. An air alert sounded in Kyiv and several other oblasts of Ukraine around 9 p.m. local time due to a mass Russian drone attack, which have been a near daily occurrence in Ukraine for over a month. Some 30 minutes later, explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital. A fire broke out on the upper floors of a residential building due to a Russian drone strike, Klitschko said. Emergency services went to the scene of impact.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-hits-multi-story-residential-building-in-kyiv/	2024-10-25T11:45:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 25: Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a regular meeting meeting with his top military and civilian officials, Zelensky called the move an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. The president called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Zelensky also said after the meeting that Ukraine had established a buffer zone in Kursk Oblast that prevents Russia from expanding the war to further Ukrainian territories in the east. Following multiple reports by Ukraine and South Korea, the U.S. acknowledged that North Korean troops were arriving in Russia. &quot;What exactly they are doing remains to be seen,&quot; said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, leaving room for doubt. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Any peace agreement to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine must be in Moscow&apos;s favor, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Ahead of Ukraine&apos;s first peace summit in June, Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts illegally claimed by Moscow in September 2022. Russia has since said it will not engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Any outcome must be in Russia&apos;s favor, I say directly, without any embarrassment, and must be based on the realities on the battlefield. And without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions here; there will be no swaps,&quot; Putin said. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot; Moscow was not invited to the June summit in Switzerland, attended by over 90 countries, dismissing the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. Following the event, Zelensky expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Yet, Moscow announced it would not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit, labeling the process a &quot;fraud.&quot; Polish President Andrzej Duda denied the possibility of transferring to Kyiv weapons systems Warsaw purchased from South Korea, Polish media RMF24 reported on Oct. 25. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Duda said he had talked to Kyiv about the possible transfer of South Korean weapons but that his response to the allies was &quot;unequivocal.&quot; &quot;There is no scenario in which we hand over weapons that we have recently bought for billions of zlotys from the pockets of our taxpayers. These weapons must serve the security and defense of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Duda said during his visit to South Korea. If Seoul agrees to supply Ukraine with weapons, it will not be from the stockpile intended for Poland, Duda added. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-kyiv-says/	2024-10-25T11:28:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Russian troop losses for October could hit 40,000, Estonian intelligence suggests	Russian troop casualties over October may reach around 40,000 troops, Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, said on Oct. 25. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Oct. 25 that Russian forces had suffered 1,630 casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set on Oct. 18. &quot;Russia&apos;s losses are quite high. And this month seems to be one of the biggest in terms of losses for Russia,&quot; Kesselmann told Estonian media EER. Russian troops continue to advance along the entire front line, made possible by constant shelling and so-called human wave infantry attacks, Kesselmann added. Russian attacks are currently most concentrated around Zelene and Kurakhove in the Pokrovsk sector of Donetsk Oblast. Meanwhile, Russian tactics have shifted recently to not entering the settlements, as this requires more &quot;sophisticated&quot; preparation, according to Estonian intelligence. &quot;Therefore, they besiege settlements with indirect fire. After the settlement is surrounded, they simply destroy it. It is a very cynical and disgusting thing,&quot; Kesselmann said. Russian troops have also advanced in the area of Chasiv Yar and the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. In Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, there were no significant changes in the territories controlled by Ukrainian troops over the past week, Estonian intelligence said. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-lose-nearly-40-000-personnel-in-war-with-ukraine-in-october-estonian-intelligence-suggests/	2024-10-25T11:09:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241864963-16583266909s1o2.jpg
Translator planned to be assigned to every 30 North Korean soldiers, Ukraine's military intelligence says	Russia plans to assign one interpreter to every 30 North Korean soldiers for better coordination with Russian troops on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to military intelligence. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers on a base in Russia were recorded on Oct. 23. Moscow is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. In the intercepted conversations, the Russian military refers to the North Korean soldiers as &quot;K Battalion,&quot; according to HUR. Apart from an interpreter, three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters. Yes, there are doubts in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice. North Korea has denied reports of its troops&apos; presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang had dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/translator-planned-to-be-assigned-to-every-30-north-korean-soldiers-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-25T09:32:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
Poland rules out transferring recently-purchased South Korean weapons to Ukraine	Polish President Andrzej Duda denied the possibility of transferring to Kyiv weapons systems Warsaw purchased from South Korea, Polish media RMF24 reported on Oct. 25. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Duda said he had talked to Kyiv about the possible transfer of South Korean weapons but that his response to the allies was &quot;unequivocal.&quot; &quot;There is no scenario in which we hand over weapons that we have recently bought for billions of zlotys from the pockets of our taxpayers. These weapons must serve the security and defense of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Duda said during his visit to South Korea. If Seoul agrees to supply Ukraine with weapons, it will not be from the stockpile intended for Poland, Duda added. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-refuses-to-transfer-south-korean-weapons-to-ukraine/	2024-10-25T09:03:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160599935-1.jpg
The little-known obstacle to Ukraine's mobilization effort	As Ukraine faces challenges with replenishing its military ranks amid manpower shortage to fight against Russia&apos;s invading forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s office claimed that U.S. officials were pressuring Kyiv to lower the minimum mobilization age &#x2013; which now stands at 25. But can Ukraine actually lower the mobilization age? There&#x2019;s a complication many don&#x2019;t know about.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-little-known-obstacle-to-ukraines-mobilization-effort/	2024-10-25T08:20:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/mobilization--2---1-.jpg
Russia 'not planning any concessions,' Putin says on peace talks with Ukraine	Any peace agreement to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine must be in Moscow&apos;s favor, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Ahead of Ukraine&apos;s first peace summit in June, Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts illegally claimed by Moscow in September 2022. Russia has since said it will not engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Any outcome must be in Russia&apos;s favor, I say directly, without any embarrassment, and must be based on the realities on the battlefield. And without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions here; there will be no swaps,&quot; Putin said. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot; Moscow was not invited to the June summit in Switzerland, attended by over 90 countries, dismissing the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. Following the event, Zelensky expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Yet, Moscow announced it would not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit, labeling the process a &quot;fraud.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/were-not-planning-any-concessions-putin-says-on-peace-talks-with-ukraine/	2024-10-25T08:08:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173543365.jpg
Rheinmetall provides Ukraine with 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles	German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall sent 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine at the end of the third quarter of 2024, the company announced on Oct. 25. Rheinmetall has so far transferred about 200 combat vehicles, including over a hundred Marder 1A3 models, to Ukraine directly or indirectly through the so-called circular exchange program. The German manufacturer first received an order for the Marder infantry fighting vehicles in March 2023. The recent batch of 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles provided to Ukraine was ordered by the German government and financed in the &quot;mid-double-digit million euros,&quot; according to the statement. Rheinmetall&apos;s Marder 1A3, which Ukraine is receiving, is equipped with additional laser rangefinders for efficient and precise target engagement. The agreement also provides for the delivery of a double-digit number of other pieces of equipment, including Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard tanks, Rheinmetall said. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four production plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-provides-ukraine-with-20-marder-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-10-25T07:16:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/marder.jpg
Zelensky rejects UN secretary-general's visit over Russia trip, presidential source tells AFP	President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine due to his participation in a summit in Russia, AFP reported on Oct. 25, citing an unnamed high-ranking source close to the Presidential Office. The Kyiv Independent reached out for comment to the Presidential Office but has not received an answer at the time of publication. Guterres attended the BRICS summit hosted in Kazan on Oct. 23-24, despite Ukraine&apos;s criticism. The U.N. secretary-general did not visit the global peace summit in Switzerland at Kyiv&apos;s invitation in the summer. &quot;After Kazan, (Guterres) wanted to come to Ukraine, but the president did not confirm his visit. So Guterres won&apos;t be here, specifically because of the humiliation of sanity and international law in Kazan,&quot; the source told AFP. In Kazan, Guterres met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The photo of their handshake was blasted by Ukrainians and some Western officials on social media. The U.N. secretary&apos;s visit came as North Korean troops are reportedly being deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and are expected to be sent to fight in Ukraine. Guterres reiterated to Putin that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine violated the U.N. charter and international law, according to a U.N. statement issued after their meeting. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, without naming Guterres. Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine was not previously announced. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, also arrived at the summit. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled the trip after suffering a head injury at home.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-reportedly-rejects-un-secretarys-visit-to-ukraine-due-to-his-kazan-summit-participation/	2024-10-25T06:58:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179912953-1.jpg
For 2nd time in October, Russia suffers 2nd deadliest day since start of full-scale invasion, Ukraine claims	For the second time this month, Russian forces have suffered their second deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released by Kyiv. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Oct. 25 reported 1,630 Russian casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set just last week. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. The figures, which the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify, &#xA0;do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; according to a U.K. military intelligence report on Sept. 23. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent last week. &quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; The Netherlands, on Oct. 25, became the latest country to confirm the deployment of North Korean troops, claiming at least 1,500 are to be stationed in Kursk Oblast where Ukraine still holds sizable territory after an incursion launched in August. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. He added that Russia is likely testing the troops and gauging international reaction. The U.S. on Oct. 23 made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby later said they were &quot;fair game&quot; for Ukrainian forces. &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; In comments to Russian state TV on Oct. 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin said using North Korea&apos;s troops in its war in Ukraine was &quot;our business,&quot; and that if Kyiv wanted to join NATO then Moscow would do what it had to ensure its security. &quot;The sooner they realize the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it,&quot; he added in reference to the deployment of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-2nd-time-in-october-russia-suffers-2nd-deadliest-day-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-ukraine-claims/	2024-10-25T05:57:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
Our business' if we deploy North Korean troops, Putin says	Any possible deployment of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would be a &quot;sovereign decision&quot; by Moscow and Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Speaking to Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, Putin did not explicitly confirm the dispatch of North Korean soldiers, saying that &quot;once it&apos;s necessary to make a decision, we will do so.&quot; When foreign journalists asked Putin about the matter at the BRICS summit on Oct. 24, he said that the Russia-North Korea defense treaty provides for such a step. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;Images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something.&quot; The comments were seen as the first indirect admission by Russia about the deployment of North Korean troops, which has already been confirmed by Ukraine, South Korea, the U.S., and others. Pyongyang has dismissed the reports as &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; Downplaying his statements at the BRICS summit, Putin nevertheless reiterated in the interview with Skabeyeva that Article 4 of the treaty enables the deployment of troops. &quot;What we will do with this article, that is still a question,&quot; the Russian president said. &quot;But I want to say that this is our sovereign decision. Whether we use it or not, where, how, or whether we engage in exercises, training, or transfer some experience. It&apos;s our business.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T05:11:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Russia has suffered 17,800 casualties since start of Kursk incursion, Syrskyi claims	Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-casualties-in-kursk/	2024-10-25T04:38:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko to reelect himself in January as regime prepares for elections	Belarus schedules next presidential election for January 2025. Belarus reportedly shoots down the second Russian drone amid ongoing incursions into its airspace. The EU supports Poland&#x2019;s migration plan, including suspended right to asylum amid the continued artificial migration crisis at the Belarus border. Russia&#x2019;s ambassador claims Moscow would help Minsk quash &#x2018;attempts to destabilize&#x2019; the country in the upcoming 2025 presidential elections. Belarus detains journalist Ihar Ilyash, husband of imprisoned reporter Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, who stayed in the country despite looming threat. Viasna claims 26 former political prisoners in Belarus face trials in October, with their sentences increased, reflecting a troubling trend of escalating political repression. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for Jan. 26, 2025, the country&#x2019;s Central Electoral Commission announced on Oct. 23. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is widely expected to hold on to power following the election&apos;s result. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 per cent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. When asked on Oct. 23 about Maria Kalesnikava, one of the leaders of the country&apos;s opposition movment kept in prison since Sept. 8, 2020, &#xA0;Lukashenko said she needs to ask for an official pardon. On Nov. 28, 2022, Kalesnikava was admitted to intensive care after suffering severe health issues. She has since been returned to serve her sentence in a penal colony. She is reportedly denied correspondence with her family and friends, and other inmates are prohibited from speaking with her. There have been almost no information on Kalesnikava&apos;s wellbeing since February 2023. Belarusian Air Defense Forces shot down a Russian Shahed-type drone over Yelsk in the southern region of Homiel on Oct. 20, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project has reported. As Russia has stepped up its drone attacks on Ukraine over the last month, incursions of Russian combat drones into the country are becoming an almost daily occurrence, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. According to the monitoring group, at least three drones entered Belarusian airspace overnight on Oct. 20. One, entering at 12:30 a.m. local time, returned to Ukraine after flying over a narrow strip of south-eastern Belarus that reaches down almost to the Kyiv Sea reservoir in Ukraine. Another drone entered Belarus from Ukraine&#x2019;s Zhytomyr Oblast and headed toward the town of Mazyr, where there is an oil refinery. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone at around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk, south of Mazyr in Homiel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Belarusian officials have not confirmed the downing. On that night, the Ukrainian army reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones launched in Russia. It said two drones veered off course to Belarus. Shahed-type drone incursions into Belarus have been reported almost daily in the past week, except for Oct. 18-19, when drones were spotted in Ukraine heading for Belarus but failed to reach its territory. Fighters were repeatedly scrambled to intercept the UAVs. The latest incident is the second time Belarus has downed a drone that entered its airspace. Belarus&#x2019;s military first confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on Sept. 5. Another drone crashed on Oct. 3 in Kalinkavichy, and a witness of the incident, a woman, was arrested. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Russian Shahed-type drones started routinely flying into Belarus in July this year. The Belarusian Hajun project reports spotting 27 UAVs in September alone. Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, Minsk, has never publicly raised objections to Moscow over the reported drone incidents. The European Commission has supported Poland&apos;s controversial policy of suspending the right to asylum for illegal migrants that are sent into the country by Belarus and Russia to create tensions on the European Union&#x2019;s eastern borders. &#x201C;Russia and Belarus, or any other country, cannot be allowed to abuse our values, including the right to asylum, and to undermine our democracies,&#x201D; reads a statement from the 27 EU leaders following a meeting in Brussels on Oct. 17. The statement also supports Poland&#x2019;s recent migration program, which includes temporarily suspending the right to asylum. &#x201C;Exceptional situations require appropriate measures,&#x201D; the statement reads. The Polish government on Oct. 15 approved Prime Minister Donald Tusk&#x2019;s program to tighten migration policies and suspend the right to asylum, sparking an outcry among human rights groups and criticism from political opponents and some of Tusk&#x2019;s own coalition members. Polish President Andrzej Duda, in an address to the Polish parliament, argued against the decision, saying it might impede the chances of dissidents from Belarus and Russia receiving asylum. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s put it bluntly: Putin and Lukashenko are trying to destabilize the situation on our border, in the EU, and your response to this is to deprive the people Putin and Lukashenko put in prison and persecute of safe haven,&#x201D; Duda said in response to Tusk&#x2019;s plan. &#x201C;I think this is some kind of fatal mistake.&#x201D; Tusk, however, said the measure would not affect dissidents. The EU&#x2019;s backing is a win for Tusk, who has been seeking to receive European approval for suspending asylum rights should &#x201C;a threat of the destabilization of the state through an influx of migrants&#x201D; occur. Poland has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a &#x201C;hybrid war,&#x201D; encouraging waves of illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East to try and cross the borders into the EU in order to put pressure on the country. Belarus denies the accusation. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, Poland stopped 26,000 illegal border crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed in a clash with migrants, and 63 sustained injuries. Belarus unleashed an artificial migration crisis in 2021 in response to the sanctions imposed on the Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime. Poland&#x2019;s officials link the more recent waves to the Kremlin, however, as the incoming migrants tend to have Russian visas. Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to Belarus, Boris Gryzlov, has said Moscow will assist Minsk if there are &#x201C;attempts to destabilize the situation&#x201D; during the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus, Russian state-affiliated news outlet RIA Novosti reported on Oct. 22. &#x201C;There is no reason to believe that the Belarusian law enforcers and special services will need additional assistance, as they say, &#x2018;on the ground,&#x2019;&#x201D; Gryzlov said in an interview with RIA Novosti. &#x201C;But if necessary, Russia, within the framework of its obligations, will certainly provide (any) assistance and support that our closest ally and strategic partner asks of us.&#x201D; Gryzlov also accused &#x201C;Western states&#x201D; of planning to interfere in the domestic affairs of Belarus and Russia, and claimed that Russia and Belarus had exchanged intelligence regarding the &#x201C;potential threats.&#x201D; The Belarusian Central Election Commission on Oct. 23 announced that the next presidential elections will be held in Belarus on Jan. 26, 2025. Longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has made contradicting statements regarding his plans to &#x201C;run for election.&#x201D; However, with all political parties eliminated in the country, apart from four that are loyal to the regime, and all opposition leaders jailed or exiled, no other realistic challengers to Lukashenko for the presidency are in sight. In 2020, Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, sparking nationwide protests eventually crushed by the regime. The regime began to crackdown on any form of dissent, with the Viasna Human Rights organization reports at least 1,300 political prisoners are currently behind bars, and over 6,000 face charges in politically motivated criminal cases. Belarusian police have detained Ihar Ilyash, a Belarusian journalist, co-author of the book &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; and the husband of another journalist already jailed for eight years on treason charges. The Belarusian Interior Ministry announced the arrest in a video posted on Oct. 22 on a pro-government channel. In the video, Ilyash confesses to &#x201C;giving interviews to various media resources, including those that have been declared to be &#x2018;extremist&#x2019; in Belarus.&#x201D; Although the official reason for the arrest was not clearly stated, the captions to the video say it is in connection with &#x201C;aiding extremist activities&#x201D; and &#x201C;gathering information for foreign intelligence services.&#x201D; Ilyash, formerly a journalist for the Polish-funded satellite TV channel Belsat, is a freelance writer and political analyst for several online news outlets. With his wife, journalist Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, he co-authored the book Belarusian Donbas, which documents Belarus&#x2019; involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine since 2014. Published in Kyiv in 2020, the book was slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in Belarus in March 2021. Despite apparent risks of persecution, Ilyash stayed in Belarus to be close to his arrested wife. Bakhvalava, a correspondent for Belsat, was among the first journalists jailed for livestreaming the nationwide protests in 2020. Having almost served out her initial two-year sentence, she was given an additional eight years in prison. Among the nearly 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, there are 39 journalists and five media workers, Reporters Without Borders says. The country scored 167 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index 2024 and was labeled Europe&#x2019;s most dangerous country for journalists before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)At least 26 former Belarusian political prisoners are facing fresh trials in October that could see their sentences become harsher &#x2013; increased from house arrest to imprisonment in penal colonies &#x2013; according to the Viasna Human Rights Center. Between June and September, Viasna recorded 15 trials in which a punishment of house arrest for people convicted in politically motivated cases was replaced with imprisonment. The organization says this is a growing trend. Since the start of the ongoing crackdown on the opposition after the 2020 presidential elections, 1,507 Belarusians have been charged in politically motivated cases and placed under house arrest, a punishment that doesn&#x2019;t meet international criteria for recognizing them as political prisoners, but places them under the strict daily control of the state. House arrest includes a curfew, restricting individuals mainly to their home and workplace, with about two hours allowed for commuting. Convicts must check in at police stations weekly, and law enforcement can conduct home visits at any time of the day or night. Missing a check or returning home late can lead to harsher penalties, including prison time.

Dutch intelligence confirms Russia deploying North Korean troops to fight Ukraine, minister says	Dutch intelligence has confirmed that Moscow has deployed at least 1,500 North Korean troops to join the war against Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on Oct. 25. The Netherlands has joined Ukraine, South Korea, and the U.S. in confirming that Pyongyang has sent military personnel to aid Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. According to the minister, the initial deployment should help Russia test the soldiers and the international reaction. Brekelmans called the move a &quot;clear escalation&quot; and said the West must present an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The move signals deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow after North Korea also supplied Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first troops will be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Kyiv and Seoul were raising alarms about the personnel transfer early on, but the U.S. acknowledged their presence only on Oct. 23, becoming the first Western country to do so. The U.S. should &quot;seriously consider taking direct military action against&#x2026; North Korean troops&quot; if they enter Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said. Pyongyang has denied the reports, while Russian President Vladimir Putin indirectly hinted at their presence but stopped short of denying or confirming the presence of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-intelligence-confirms-russia-deploying-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T04:01:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/dutch.jpg
How Russia attempted to steal Moldovan election, referendum, and what comes next?	Although Russian interference has taken many forms in Moldova since its independence in 1991, the election and referendum results on Sunday shocked many pro-European Moldovans. Despite opinion polls showing clear support for entrenching the desire for EU accession into the country&apos;s constitution, the success of the EU referendum came down to the wire, with the support of the large Moldovan diaspora securing a 50.38% victory margin. The &quot;yes&quot; vote won by a mere 11,000 votes. Moldovan authorities, the EU, and U.S. officials, as well as independent observers, blamed an unprecedented attack on the country&apos;s democracy from criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Two weeks before the referendum and presidential election that took place on the same day, Moldovan police and the country&apos;s anti-corruption agency announced that they had evidence that around 130,000 people were to take bribes from Russian-linked forces in an attempt to overturn the referendum&apos;s results. In a press briefing at 1AM, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that, according to her information, those who were set to disrupt the referendum were incentivized to buy up to 300,000 votes. If true, that would represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ballots cast on Oct. 20. Altogether, the police said fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor transferred $39 million to buy votes in September and October. Shor, who still maintains some political support despite being on the run, denies any wrongdoing.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Journalistic investigations by Ziarul de Gard&#x103; and Zona de securitate confirmed that the scheme was conducted through Telegram groups and used the Russian state-owned bank Promsvyazbank and its branches in the country&apos;s eastern Russian-influenced breakaway region of Transnistria. &quot;Simple mathematical calculus confirm what the authorities have said: yes, there was massive electoral fraud,&quot; said Tatiana Cojocari, a sociologist from Watchdog, one of the think tanks that commissioned polls in Moldova. &quot;People who would have otherwise not cast their ballots were bought. We had a mass bribe-driven mobilization for the &apos;no&apos; vote in the referendum, just like media investigations showed,&quot; she added. Following the conclusion of the referendum, all eyes are now on the presidential election runoff, set for Nov. 3. Pro-EU President Sandu will run against the former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, whom she dismissed for alleged corruption. Stoianoglo scored 26% in the first round, considerably more than the 9-11% opinion polls predicted. While Stoianoglo, like Sandu, is a double Moldovan-Romanian citizen and publicly says he supports his country&apos;s EU accession, the former prosecutor is supported by the pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists. He also opposed the referendum, dismissing it as serving the interest of Sandu rather than the EU integration process. Days before the election, screenshots from Telegram groups were leaked to the press saying the vote buying network controlled by fugitive oligarch Shor, who now lives in Moscow, was asked to vote for Stoianoglo. Both Shor and Stoianoglo deny any involvement in bribery schemes. &quot;Criminal networks have shown that they are stronger on the technological front than state institutions,&quot; analyst Igor Bo&#x21B;an, from the think tank ADEPT, told Kyiv Independent. To ensure fair elections on Nov. 3 and next summer (during parliament elections), the government would need to block bank transactions from Russia and the use of cryptocurrency in Moldova, through which Russian money is channeled. &quot;If they don&apos;t have the capacity to do it, they should appeal to EU partners for support,&quot; Bo&#x21B;an said. According to analyst Victor Ciobanu, the election results showed a protest vote that should be a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for Sandu&apos;s pro-European government. Since the war in Ukraine, inflation has risen by 40% in Moldova, while salaries and pensions have not caught up. Many blame the rising prices on the government and share a frustration with the slow anti-corruption and judiciary reforms. &quot;But the government can and should be changed only as a result of normal, fair, and honest elections,&quot; Ciobanu said. &quot;What has been happening here for several years now &#x2014; in Orhei, Gagauzia, and now nationally &#x2014; cannot be called elections&quot; because of the overwhelming presence of &quot;dirty money&quot; and &quot;lies,&quot; he said. If the process of corrupting the foundations of democracy is not stopped, Ciobanu argues, in 2025, after parliamentary elections, Moldovans will end up with &quot;a captured mafia state&quot; once again. &quot;And the Kremlin will get a pro-Russian government in Moldova without a single shot (fired) and the opportunity to open a second front against Ukraine,&quot; Ciobanu added. Political scientist Ileana Racheru agrees that if Moscow controls the government, Russia could use Chisinau airport to transport military help via Istanbul or Yerevan. &quot;If the pro-Russians come to power, I don&apos;t think Russia will give them money to keep Moldova afloat, to address chronic poverty. They will need money from the EU and will delay the process (eventually), both to please Russia and to take care of their own business and corruption schemes. But we don&apos;t know if Russia would be happy with the situation,&quot; Racheru said. &quot;They could ask for help in Ukraine,&quot; she added. Bo&#x21B;an, meanwhile, said that such scenarios, where a Russia-friendly government takes over Moldova, are unpredictable and that &quot;for Ukraine, it would not be a problem to neutralize a danger coming from Moldova if they have enough resources.&quot; He is more concerned about the impact such a result would have on Moldova, including a &quot;catastrophic exodus of the young.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-tried-to-influence-moldovan-elections-and-referendum-what-it-means-going-forward/	2024-10-25T03:11:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178799635.jpg
Kyiv receives lists of missing Ukrainian soldiers via Qatar, ombudsman says	Ukraine has received a list of missing Ukrainian soldiers thanks to mediation by Qatar, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 24 Lubinets made the announcement on his Telegram channel after visiting Qatar and meeting Lolwah Al-Khater, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry senior official. The Gulf country has previously acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. Lubinets did not specify in his statement whether the lists were provided to Qatar by Moscow or the status of the listed missing soldiers. Apart from the list, he received letters from Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) for their families and discussed the possibility of speeding up the process of POW exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow. The parties also agreed to provide assistance to civilians in difficult life situations, including in restoring personal documents, Lubinets said. According to the Interior Ministry, Ukraine records 55,000 citizens in its register of persons missing under special circumstances as of late September. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-receives-list-of-missing-ukrainian-soldiers-via-qatar-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-25T03:00:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2030921955.jpg
Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a meeting with the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Zelensky called it an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. He called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-zelensky-says/	2024-10-25T02:44:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
We can't have a bad outcome,' JP Morgan Chase CEO says on Ukraine, Russia's nuclear threats	&quot;We can&apos;t have a bad outcome&quot; in Ukraine, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Oct. 24 when discussing Russia&apos;s full-scale war and its nuclear threats. &quot;Nuclear proliferation is the biggest risk mankind faces,&quot; said Dimon, head of the largest U.S. bank and the world&apos;s largest investment bank by revenue. According to him, the West has to have clarity and subordinate many things &quot;to make sure that this ends up right.&quot; Dimon has described himself as a supporter of Ukraine, and JPMorgan Chase has been involved in Ukraine&apos;s recovery efforts. Along with another U.S. investment firm, BlackRock, the company agreed to set up a $15 billion fund for Ukraine. &quot;A lot of other nations that border Russia, they&apos;re quite worried. And some of (those who) don&apos;t border Russia are quite worried,&quot; he said. &quot;And we have never had a situation where a man is threatening nuclear blackmail, &apos;if your military starts to win, we are rolling out the nuclear weapons&apos; type of thing.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Moscow continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. &quot;I think we should be very careful about what we are trying to accomplish in the next couple of years,&quot; Dimon said, voicing a belief that nuclear proliferation is an even greater challenge to humanity than climate change. Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine in late September. This coincided with the peak of discussions between Ukraine and its key partners to allow Kyiv to strike targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied long-range weapons. The Kremlin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear arms and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. In late September, Dimon described Russia and its two key allies in its all-out war, Iran and North Korea,&quot; as an &quot;evil axis who are working every day on how to make it worse for the Western world and for America.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast. In return, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov.	https://kyivindependent.com/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-ukraine/	2024-10-25T02:33:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179863701.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian Buk air defenses, destroys radar guidance system	Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-buk-systems/	2024-10-25T01:59:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Buk-M3.jpg
Russian National Guard attacked in Chechnya, 1 killed	Members of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardiya) came under an attack by unknown assailants in Chechnya, leaving one service member killed and another injured, the guard told the state news agency TASS on Oct. 24. The incident took place near Grozny, the capital of Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim republic in the North Caucasus ruled by Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally, dictator Ramzan Kadyrov. Chechnya fought two wars of independence against Russia in the 1990s and 2000s, which resulted in Moscow reasserting its rule after a long and bloody conflict. The injured service member was taken to the hospital. Efforts to find and detain the attackers are underway, the guard told TASS, without saying who was behind the attack. According to the Russian Telegram channel Baza, the attack took place around midday on Oct. 24 near the village of Petropavlovskaya, which lies some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Grozny. Unknown attackers shot at a Ural truck and fled the scene afterward, Baza claimed. The channel shared a picture of the killed serviceman. The Chechen anti-government group Niyso also reported on the attack on its Telegram channel, sharing the footage. The Kyiv Independent is not publishing some of the footage due to its sensitive nature. Pro-Kremlin Chechen fighters (&quot;Kadyrovites&quot;) have been fighting on Russia&apos;s side since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. In turn, anti-Russian Chechen volunteers have also joined the war on Ukraine&apos;s side, forming several formations like the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-guard-attacked-in-chechnya/	2024-10-25T01:11:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_19-35-53--2--1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 25. Ukrainian forces downed 36 out of 63 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Sixteen more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. The aerial targets were destroyed over 12 oblasts across Ukraine, with around 15 drones downed near Kyiv, according to local authorities. Five people were killed in the settlements of Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, Zelene, and Dachenske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. One more person was injured in the region over the past day. Russian forces attacked the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast with an ODAB-1500 air bomb, killing a 73-year-old woman and injuring 10 other people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The strike partially destroyed a two-story commercial building and damaged 12 stalls, a kindergarten, and several residential buildings. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 26 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-16-over-past-day/	2024-10-25T01:02:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_13-03-25-1.jpg
Russia provided Yemen's Houthis with satellite data to attack vessels in Red Sea, WSJ reports	Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to attack ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 24, citing a person familiar with the matter and two unnamed European defense officials. The Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group based in Yemen. Following Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza in 2023, the Houthis began launching attacks against Western shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Russian targeting data helped the Houthis expand their strikes, the sources told the WSJ. The data was reportedly handed over through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such assistance shows how much Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to undermine the Western economic and political order, the WSJ wrote. According to experts, Russia is trying to foment instability from the Middle East to Asia to cause problems for the U.S. The WSJ reported in early October that infamous Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released in a prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. in 2022, was suspected of preparing a small arms deal with Houthi militants. Iran, one of Russia&apos;s key allies, was also brokering secret negotiations between Moscow and Yemen&apos;s Houthis to transfer Yakhont supersonic anti-ship missiles, Reuters reported in late September, citing seven unnamed sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-provided-yemens-houthis-with-satellite-data-to-attack-vessels-in-red-sea-wsj-reports/	2024-10-24T23:50:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2152895460.jpg
Musk has been in contact with Putin since 2022, WSJ reports	Business tycoon Elon Musk, one of the richest people in the world, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials since late 2022, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 25, citing undisclosed official sources. Musk, known as the founder and CEO of the space and telecom company SpaceX and the owner of the social media platform X, came out in support of Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, donating Starlink communication terminals that greatly assisted Ukrainian defenders. His views progressively shifted toward pro-Russian positions later during the war, and the billionaire prevented Ukraine from using Starlink terminals in strikes on the Russian fleet. He has also complained that he is &quot;losing money&quot; by providing Starlink service to Ukraine. The business tycoon, who has backed the campaign of Republican presidential nominee and ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, has previously denied sympathizing with Moscow and claimed he talked with Putin only once in April 2021 about space-related topics. Former and current European, U.S., and Russian officials told the WSJ that Musk has held further conversations with Putin and other high-ranking Kremlin officials since late 2022. This reportedly included Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin&apos;s first deputy chief of staff, who has been named as the top figure of Russian propaganda and disinformation activities. Since Musk acquired X (formerly known as Twitter), experts have pointed out a sharp rise of disinformation, hate speech, and radical and pro-authoritarian content on the platform. Musk, an avid user of the platform himself, used it to speak out against the passage of a Ukraine aid bill earlier this year and said that &quot;there is no way in hell&quot; that Russia could lose the war. Putin also asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to Beijing, which claims the island as its sovereign territory, the WSJ wrote. Starlink is currently not active in Taiwan. The Kremlin has denied communicating with Musk, and White House officials told the WSJ they are not aware of it. Musk did not respond to the WSJ&apos;s request for comment. According to the WSJ, the contacts are a well-kept secret in the U.S. government due to Musk&apos;s access to sensitive information as a major security and technology contractor. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, was awarded a classified $1.8 billion contract in 2021, reportedly to build a network of spy satellites for U.S. intelligence. Security-related concerns regarding Musk also arose over Russia&apos;s increasing use of Starlink terminals bought via third-party countries, boosting Russian forces as they grind on in Ukraine&apos;s east. Musk said that SpaceX does not sell equipment to Moscow and that it would not operate in Russia. The matter is all the more sensitive as Musk has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Trump, even joining him at a rally in Pennsylvania in early October. The former president said that he could appoint Musk to run a &quot;government efficiency commission&quot; if he wins the election. Trump has previously criticized the support the Biden administration has provided to Ukraine, sparking fears he might withdraw Washington&apos;s support if re-elected on Nov. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-putin-wsj/	2024-10-24T23:42:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1853200567.jpg
Kyiv preparing internal plan to 'strengthen Ukraine,' Zelensky confirms	Ukraine is developing an internal plan for strengthening the country in the economic, military, informational, and other spheres, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in his evening address on Oct. 24. According to Zelensky, the internal plan, together with the victory plan, will ensure that Ukraine &quot;has the right answers to all the challenges of this year and next year.&quot; The confirmation comes days after a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv is preparing an action plan to withstand Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The plan is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. The president tasked Ukrainian top officials with developing the plan. The president said Ukraine&apos;s economy, countering Russian disinformation, social protection, and &quot;the issue of justice&quot; need to be strengthened. &quot;This plan for internal strengthening will also guarantee Ukraine&apos;s unity,&quot; he added. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier on Oct. 23, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-internal-plan/	2024-10-24T23:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193-1.jpg

Putin acknowledges possible presence of North Korean troops in Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to indirectly acknowledge reports of North Korean troops in Russia when speaking to foreign journalists on Oct. 24. He referred to the mutual defense clause in Russia and North Korea&#x2019;s newly signed security treaty. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something,&quot; stopping short of confirming or denying the claims, which the United States has also raised. Putin then pointed to the Russia-North Korea defense treaty, which Russia&#x2019;s parliament ratified on Oct. 24: &quot;As for our relations with the DPRK, the treaty was ratified today; it has Article 4. We have never doubted that North Korean leadership takes the agreement seriously.&quot; Article 4 of the agreement specifies that if either nation faces an &quot;armed invasion,&quot; the other is committed to providing &quot;military and other assistance with all means in its possession.&quot; This provision establishes the closest military alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang since the Cold War. In August, Ukrainian forces crossed into Russia, seizing control of several hundred square miles in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24 that the first North Korean soldiers had been deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent around 12,000 troops, including 500 officers and three generals, with initial sightings reported on Oct. 23.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-possible-presence-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia/	2024-10-24T22:00:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178238738.jpg
Sanctions delay to Russian zinc mine results in supply miscalculations, Reuters reports	Western sanctions on Russia&apos;s Ozernoye zinc mine have left the company struggling to replace key equipment needed to boost production, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. This shortage is expected to impact global zinc supply forecasts for 2025, with projections likely overstated. Without Ozernoye&#x2019;s significant contribution, the ongoing shortage of zinc concentrate&#x2014;an essential raw material for producing zinc metal used in galvanizing steel&#x2014;is expected to continue. This supply crunch has already driven zinc prices to a 20-month high. Ozernoye has told Reuters it plans to produce zinc concentrate in volumes similar to previous targets, despite these challenges. Ozernoye, which began production in September, aimed to reach full capacity by 2025 with an annual output of about 320,000 metric tons of zinc in concentrate, equivalent to 2.5% of the global mined zinc supply projected for next year, according to the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group (ILZSG). The ILZSG had forecast an 8.9% increase in zinc supply outside China for 2025, factoring in Ozernoye&apos;s ramp-up. However, the sources indicated that Ozernoye has not yet produced any material due to difficulties replacing the components needed to process ore into concentrate, which were damaged in a fire in November 2023. These components, originally supplied by Glencore Technology, are no longer available to Ozernoye due to U.S. sanctions imposed after the fire. Glencore, which uses similar equipment in its Australian operations, confirmed it would comply with all sanctions but declined to comment further.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-delay-to-russian-zinc-mine-triggers-supply-miscalculations-reuters-reports/	2024-10-24T19:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2144464230.jpg
Moscow funneled $39 million into Moldova ahead of presidential election in attempt to influence results, Moldovan authorities say	Moscow funneled a total of $39 million in a scheme led by a pro-Russian oligarch aimed at influencing election results by paying ordinary citizens to vote against closer ties with the West, the country&apos;s national police chief said on Oct. 24. Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, is accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. The election, held on Oct. 20, saw incumbent pro-European Moldovan President Maia Sandu come in first in the initial round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Voters also voted in favor of a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution by a razor-thin margin, in a blow to supporters who wanted to see closer ties to Russia. Moldovan authorities said that in September over $15 million in Russian funds had been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Another $24 million was &quot;poured&quot; in throughout the month of October, authorities said, Moldova media reported. At the time, Moldova&#x2019;s chief of police, Viorel Cern&#x103;u&#x21B;eanu, told POLITICO that &quot;Moldova is facing a phenomenon of voter bribery, combined with hybrid warfare and disinformation, the likes of which our country has never seen before.&quot; Moldova&apos;s Foreign Ministry said that police raids are ongoing for those involved in the operations law enforcement officers. Authorities said they arrested individuals on Oct. 23 that they had found with envelopes with cash intended to allegedly bribe voters in 19 districts. Sandu will face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists and gained roughly 26% of the vote in the first round. Chisinau has been supportive of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and cracked down on Russian subversive operations at home, expelling dozens of diplomats and embassy staff in July 2023 after revelations of espionage activities. Russia&apos;s invasion sparked fears in Moldova of a possible spillover of hostilities, namely via the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-funneled-39-million-into-moldova-ahead-of-presidential-election-in-attempt-to-influence-results-moldovan-authorities-say/	2024-10-24T15:47:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1738459748.jpeg
Ukraine cannot join NATO while at war, Scholz says	Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Kyiv&apos;s appeals for an immediate invitation to join NATO, stating that &quot;a country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;Everyone knows that, there is no disagreement on this subject,&quot; Scholz added. The comments appear to be the first public comments made by Scholz on Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations since President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan to Western allies, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. Germany was reportedly previously known to have reservations about the move. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within months, not years. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. During the interview, Scholz said that NATO allies &quot;have described a perspective&quot; on Ukraine&apos;s eventual accession to the alliance, adding &quot;but I think that beyond that, there is currently no need for any new decision.&quot; Further rejecting Zelensky&apos;s calls for an invitation to join the alliance as outlined in the victory plan, Scholz said that &quot;an invitation is normally quite quickly linked to membership.&quot; Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this (skepticism)... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 22. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends, the president said in April. Earlier on Oct. 24, following a meeting Scholz in Berlin, Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said that Ukraine&apos;s immediate accession to NATO was &quot;not realistic.&quot; &quot;We agreed with the Chancellor that today the issue of Ukraine&apos;s accession is not on the table, and it cannot come to the table,&quot; Pellegrini said. Pellegrini&apos;s comments come just a day after Politico reported that at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, according to four anonymous U.S. and NATO officials and diplomats. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told reporters that NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance in the immediate future.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-cannot-join-nato-immediately-scholz-says/	2024-10-24T14:10:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Uzbekistan refuses to join Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia	Tashkent has no intention of joining the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, the Moscow Times reported on Oct. 24, citing Akmal Saidov, First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Uzbek Parliament. As the full-scale invasion began, several allies started to distance themselves from Moscow to avoid potential economic sanctions, among other reasons. In mid-October, Kazakhstan announced it would not join the BRICS, where Russia is a founding member. While, in early September, Armenia announced that it had frozen its membership &quot;at all levels&quot; in another Russian-led alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin arrived in Tashkent in August to hold talks with Uzbek officials about potentially joining the EAEU, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the new &quot;center of a multipolar world.&quot; Following a meeting with Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Mishustin promised Tashkent &quot;business benefits,&quot; &quot;new markets,&quot; and &quot;fair competition.&quot; Despite the Russian promises, a parliamentary commission that studied about a thousand of the EAEU&apos;s foundational documents &quot;did not find any benefits for Uzbekistan,&quot; Saidov said. Saidov added that Kazakhstan has not benefited much from its participation in the EAEU either, and thus, it will be &quot;optimal&quot; for Uzbekistan to remain in observer status and maintain its independence and sovereignty. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Uzbekistan declared that it did not recognize the proxy authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and supported Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. Tashkent continues to actively trade with Moscow, and the Uzbek government maintains close ties with the Russian leadership. On May 26, Putin arrived in Uzbekistan&apos;s capital to discuss strengthening bilateral relations with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. That visit marked Putin&apos;s third international trip since his inauguration for the fifth presidential term, secured in the March election broadly seen as rigged.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbekistan-refuses-to-join-eurasian-economic-union-which-includes-russia/	2024-10-24T13:20:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154375705.jpg

Ukraine says it has recipe for ‘long-range capabilities,’ only needs financial backing	Ukraine says it has the know-how to produce more much-needed drones as well as missiles for strikes deep into Russia, and all it needs is financial backing from Western allies. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got all the knowledge, we&apos;ve got all the capabilities in place,&#x201D; Alexander Kamyshin, advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky for strategic affairs, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 24. Kamyshin, the former Minister of Strategic Industries who has overseen Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic weaponry manufacturing for a year and a half before taking on his new advisor role last month, said Kyiv is asking allies for financial backing to achieve its battlefield-tested innovation and production potential. He spoke after a months-long push by Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials pleading for the U.S. and other allies to approve the use of their missiles for strikes deep inside Russia, an effort which Kyiv appears to have not given up on despite an apparent lack of success. Ukraine has so far relied heavily on massive weaponry supplies from NATO members, but Kamyshin said Ukraine could, on its own with funding, produce more sophisticated kit using priceless experience gained through more than two and a half years of fighting back against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Alexander Kamyshin in Berlin, Germany, Sep. 19, 2022. (Carsten Koall/picture alliance via Getty Images)&#x201C;Our capabilities are significantly higher than the funding available, so it&apos;s a significant amount of money, but we discuss it with our partners,&#x201D; Kamyshin said, declining to disclose the estimate needed. President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21 that the U.S. is expected to provide Ukraine with $1.6 billion for its domestic long-range weapon production. Ukraine would receive the first tranche of $800 million in the &quot;coming days,&quot; and the second tranche of $700 million to $800 million afterwards, the president said after this week&#x2019;s visit of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a September event that Ukraine&#x2019;s potential for domestic production could reach $20 billion with foreign investment &#x2014; more than three times the estimated 2024 projection from last year. Western allies&#x2019; apparent shift of focus to allocating substantial money on Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike development rather than providing their own kits comes after Kyiv&#x2019;s months-long pleas for permission to strike deep into Russia with Western weaponry yielded no results. The future of Western military aid is becoming ever more uncertain, with the high-stakes U.S. presidential election coming up in early November. Both presidential candidates remain vague on their Ukraine policy, with Republican candidate Donald Trump skeptical about further U.S. support for Kyiv and Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket not addressing it in detail. Though Moscow has the initiative across most of the front line, Kyiv has regularly struck targets such as arms depots, oil refineries, and airfields hundreds of kilometers inside Russia. For Ukraine, the slingshot strikes deep into Russia are essential to reduce the bigger foe&#x2019;s combat capability from afar. &#x201C;We proved that we can reach deep inside Russia, and for that reason, we believe that funding the procurement of things made in Ukraine is a good move for our partners,&#x201D; Kamyshin said, referring to the series of strikes. His comments also refer to technological advancements made by Kyiv that could be shared with allies in fast-developing future warfare tactics, including the massive use of drones in the air, on the ground, and at sea in an asymmetric war where Russia has the conventional firepower advantage. Kamyshin said that Ukraine has &#x201C;commitments&#x201D; from allies, including the U.S., Denmark, and Lithuania, to fund the procurement of Ukrainian-made deep-strike capabilities. &#x201C;So, at this point, we are at the point of finalizing arrangements on funding this procurement,&#x201D; Kamyshin said. A growing number of Western allies are funding Ukrainian weaponry development and have taken on joint production projects to compete against Russia&#x2019;s massive Soviet-era stocks with cutting-edge technologies. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey also said on Oct. 22 that his country would lend almost $3 billion for the production of long-range drones. Lithuania announced in September that it is investing $11 million in the development of Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range &#x201C;Palianytsia&#x201D; weapon. Zelensky confirmed the first successful use of the new Ukrainian &#x201C;missile drone&#x201D; in late August. &#x201C;All co-production and all investments in defense manufacturing are very important to us. This is a priority today,&#x201D; Zelensky said during the visit of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in September. &#x201C;Right now, everyone can see how successful Ukraine is in developing and deploying its long-range weapons and long-range drones.&#x201D; Zelensky said at the Second International Forum of Defense Industries in October that Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones a year and already has contracts to manufacture 1.5 million. Ukraine has refrained from revealing more about missiles due to sensitivity of the issue. Kamyshin declined to reveal the details about the long-range weapons being developed, including whether they would include Ukraine&apos;s homemade Hrim-2 (Grim-2) ballistic missile. Another Ukrainian-developed missile, the Neptune, was used in 2022 to sink the Moskva, the flagship of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet based in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has come a long way in honing its homemade drones to bring the war to Russia. Kamyshin said Ukraine started striking deep inside Russia in late 2023, and the Ukrainian engineering capabilities have been &quot;growing on and on.&#x201D; &#x201C;We see an increase in the interest of our Western allies in funding things procured from Ukrainian producers,&#x201D; Kamyshin said. &#x201C;We proved that they are capable.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-has-recipe-for-long-range-capabilities-only-needs-financial-backing/	2024-10-24T11:30:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
Ukraine war latest: First North Korean troops arrive in Kursk Oblast to participate in Russia's war against Ukraine	Key developments on Oct. 24: The first North Korean soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been deployed to the front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Oct. 23. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov has been appointed to supervise the training and adaptation of the North Korean troops, who are given &quot;a few weeks&quot; to adjust, according to HUR&apos;s report. The North Korean military is provided with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing, footwear, and hygiene products. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, each soldier receives 50 meters of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month. Ukrainian intelligence claimed that Russia has &quot;high hopes&quot; for the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war. North Korea has denied reports of North Korean troop presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. Additionally, South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Oct. 23. Earlier in the day, the U.S. made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea. Kyiv and Seoul say Moscow is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; &quot; We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we&apos;re certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic move, and on how we might respond,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect to have more to share on all of that in the coming days.&quot; South Korea could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities,&quot; President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 24. &quot;If North Korea dispatches special forces to the Ukraine war, we will provide support to Ukraine step by step and consider taking necessary measures for the security of the Korean Peninsula,&quot; Yoon said in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Seoul. &quot;We have adhered to a principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, but we can review this more flexibly depending on North Korean military activities,&quot; he added. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Both Yoon and Duda denounced the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia, describing it as a &quot;direct violation of the U.N. Charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions,&quot; in comments reported by South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency. &quot;(South Korea) will never sit idle over this and take necessary measures step by step in coordination with the international community depending on the development of N. Korea-Russia military cooperation,&quot; Yoon added. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but has been indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent earlier this week said South Korea is unlikely to begin supplying weapons directly anytime soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; Yoon&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. Russian troops are attempting to establish crossings near the Oskil River to advance toward the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, according to Ruslan Muzychuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, who spoke on national television on Oct. 24. Kupiansk is a strategically significant city in Kharkiv Oblast that was temporarily occupied by Russian forces in 2022. In recent months, the city has faced heavy attacks as Russia intensified its offensive in the area. Russian forces have become increasingly active near Kupiansk, particularly following an attempted renewed offensive in Kharkiv. &quot;The enemy is now also concentrating its main efforts on reaching... the Oskil River. Near the river, the enemy is trying to set up crossings,&quot; Muzychuk said. In the Kupiansk sector of the front line, Russian troops have recently increased their use of armored vehicles. Active hostilities have been reported in the areas surrounding the settlements of Tabaiivka, Pishchane, and Kolysnikivka. The Russian army attempted to seize the Oskil River crossing and expand its offensive on the eastern bank, but Ukrainian National Guard troops successfully halted this advance, as reported by Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, on Oct. 20. On Oct. 18, Ukrainian forces liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; the village of Kruhliakivka in Kharkiv Oblast of Russian soldiers. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) described Kruhliakivka as important for the defense of Kupiansk. Ukrainian military, lawmakers, and experts discussed the creation of a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to cyberspace operations, the General Staff said on Oct. 24. &quot;The creation of Cyber Forces as a separate branch will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, ensure effective planning and implementation of the full range of tasks in cyberspace, which, along with land, sea, air and space, is recognized as a separate operational domain,&quot; the statement read. The participants of the meeting reviewed the main provisions of a draft concept of the branch, and defined the main functions and tasks of any future cyber army. They also examined the experience of Western cyber forces, and analyzed the relevant experience of the Ukrainian army during Russia&apos;s all-out war. At the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine launched an IT army, which was joined by thousands of specialists in the first days of February 2022. It has reportedly carried out multiple cyberattack on Russian online websites.Russian hackers have also regularly targeted various Ukrainian government institutions as well as businesses with crippling cyberattacks aimed at disrupting numerous industries and government services.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-first-north-korean-troops-arrive-in-kursk-oblast-to-participate-in-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2024-10-24T11:27:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Why did Ukraine's prosecutor general resign, and who will replace him?	The formal reason for Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin&apos;s resignation on Oct. 22 was the ongoing major corruption scandal involving hundreds of prosecutors who obtained disability benefits, including financial support, the ability to evade the military draft and leave the country at will. A crucial question is whether Kostin&apos;s resignation will solve the problem of fake disability documents and corruption at the prosecutor&apos;s office in general and whether his replacement will be any better. Some anti-corruption activists see him as a scapegoat blamed for the scandal. &quot;The resignation was supposed to ease public tension,&quot; Olena Shcherban, a deputy executive director at the Kyiv-based NGO Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But will it solve the problem? We are still very far from that.&quot; A number of experts have also mentioned other reasons that might have led to Kostin&apos;s dismissal, apart from the ongoing scandal. Although Kostin was appointed to the job as a loyalist of President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022, the President&apos;s Office could have been unhappy with the prosecutor&apos;s decision to greenlight corruption cases against lawmakers from the president&apos;s party, according to Shcherban and Yury Nikolov, an investigative journalist who has exposed top-level corruption. The President&apos;s Office has also been reportedly unhappy with Kostin&apos;s frequent trips abroad, according to Oleksandr Lemenov, head of anti-corruption watchdog StateWatch. Lemenov and Nikolov also said, citing their sources, that Kostin had allegedly been wanting to resign himself. &#x201C;I think he was on his way out already and was hoping to get an ambassadorial post in The Hague,&quot; a source familiar with decision-making in Zelensky&#x2019;s office told the Kyiv Independent. Overall, the experts polled by the Kyiv Independent see Kostin&apos;s track record as mixed. On the one hand, they say he has not scored any great achievements, and there were no efforts to reform the corrupt prosecutor&apos;s office. On the other hand, Kostin did not block or sabotage any high-profile cases, they argue. Kostin&apos;s spokesperson, Nadiya Maksimets, told the Kyiv Independent he was not immediately available for comment. The President&apos;s Office did not respond to requests for comment. Kostin&apos;s resignation came amid reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status en masse. Kostin said on Oct. 20 that only in Khmelnytskyi Oblast 61 prosecutors had obtained disability certificates. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Head Vasyl Maliuk said on Oct. 22 that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Kostin submitted his resignation after a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) meeting chaired by Zelensky. During the meeting, the &quot;immoral situation&quot; with the fake disabilities of prosecutors was discussed, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. &quot;I am grateful to the president of Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s Verkhovna Rada for their trust. But in this situation, I believe it is right for me to resign from the post of prosecutor general,&quot; he said. Kostin&apos;s resignation has yet to be approved by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament. Shcherban from the Anti-Corruption Action Center said that Kostin had become a scapegoat blamed by the authorities for the scandal with fake disability certificates. She said that the problem of prosecutors&apos; involvement in such corrupt practices had existed long before Kostin. Prosecutor of Ukraine Andriy Kostin at the &quot;Ukraine. Year 2024&quot; forum in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 25, 2024. (Andriy Zhyhaylo/Obozrevatel/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;It&apos;s a result of systemic problems and a lack of the desire to reform the prosecutor&apos;s office,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The reform of the prosecutor&apos;s office has failed.&quot; Shcherban added that previous efforts under former Prosecutor General Ruslan Riaboshapka to vet prosecutors and fire those who did not meet integrity and professionalism standards stalled after he was fired in 2020. Nikolov, who has investigated corruption in the defense ministry and law enforcement, dismissed the decision to blame Kostin as &quot;populism.&quot; &quot;Kostin is not the cause of the problem,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Nikolov believes the cause is the corrupt system, and Kostin, however, should have been tasked with reforming the prosecutor&apos;s office and firing corrupt prosecutors instead of evading this responsibility. Another reason for Kostin&apos;s resignation could have been that Kostin didn&apos;t obstruct corruption investigations, even against those who were close to the President&apos;s Office. The President&apos;s Office could have been unhappy with Kostin authorizing charges for lawmakers from Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party brought by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), Shcherban said. Nikolov also said that, according to his sources, Kostin had seldom communicated with the President&apos;s Office, and there had been some tension between him and the President&apos;s Office. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify this claim. In August, Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, accused the President&apos;s Office of allowing pro-government lawmaker Artem Dmytryk to flee abroad before being charged with beating a law enforcement officer and a soldier. Another Servant of the People lawmaker, Andriy Odarchenko, fled Ukraine through Zakarpattia Oblast in September before being charged with bribery. Odarchenko has admitted being friends with Viktor Mykyta, former governor of Zakarpattia Oblast and currently a deputy head of the President&apos;s Office. The blame had been placed on the prosecutor general for allowing this to happen. Another source of tension between Kostin and the President&apos;s Office could have been his frequent trips abroad, according to Lemenov. Kostin spent 103 days on foreign business trips in 2023, the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet reported in April, citing Kostin&apos;s asset declaration, law enforcement sources, and a response to an official request by lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko. He spent half of the trips in the U.S., where his wife lives, according to the news outlet. Anti-corruption activists say Kostin&apos;s track record as prosecutor general remains mixed. &quot;I don&apos;t see either great achievements or great failures (under Kostin),&quot; Shcherban said. The upside is that Kostin did not block NABU cases, in contrast with his predecessor Iryna Venediktova, according to Shcherban and Nikolov. Shcherban said &quot;Kostin worried about his reputation among international partners.&quot; Venediktova has denied the accusations of sabotage. One of the achievements under Kostin that the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office itself has highlighted is the investigation of Russian war crimes. Yury Belousov, head of the war crimes department at the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, said in early October that 708 Russian soldiers had been charged with war crimes since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and 131 out of them had been convicted. Lemenov was more skeptical, arguing that &quot;anyone would be considered more effective if compared with Venediktova.&quot; He called Kostin a &quot;hidden or shadow prosecutor&quot; due to his alleged inactivity.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;Two years and three months have passed (since Kostin was appointed as prosecutor general),&quot; Lemenov said. &quot;Whether he was there or not makes no difference.&quot; Lemenov added that he had been appointed to several vetting commissions by Kostin but there had been no efforts by the prosecutor general to reform or fix Ukraine&apos;s stagnant prosecution. Before being appointed as prosecutor general, Kostin applied for the job of the chief anti-corruption prosecutor in 2021-2022. Several civic watchdogs, including the Anti-Corruption Action Center, AutoMaidan, Dejure, and Transparency International, concluded then that Kostin did not meet ethics and integrity standards and violated the principle of political neutrality. The watchdogs saw him as being too close to Zelensky and his administration. Eventually he was vetoed by a panel including international experts and did not get the job. The panel based its veto on the accusations of nepotism and alleged violations in Kostin&apos;s asset declarations. He denied the accusations of wrongdoing. Kostin has also been criticized for visiting Russian-occupied Crimea in 2015 and 2018. He argued that he had visited a doctor on the occupied peninsula. Regardless of Kostin&apos;s track record, the &quot;crucial question is who will replace him,&quot; Shcherban said. There is a high likelihood that his successor will be worse and less independent than Kostin, she added. Nikolov said that his resignation would only make sense if Kostin were replaced with an effective prosecutor general who would reform the prosecutor&apos;s office and fire those responsible for violations. Potential candidates allegedly being considered as a replacement for Kostin include Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper and Kyiv Oblast Governor Ruslan Kravchenko, according to Shcherban and Lemenov. NV, a Ukrainian media outlet, also reported on Oct. 23, citing their sources at the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office and the Verkhovna Rada, that Kravchenko could replace Kostin. Shcherban said that Kravchenko and Kiper are seen as loyalists of the President&apos;s Office, and Kiper has a controversial reputation. Kiper has been involved in a corruption scandal following the publication of an investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes project on Oct. 23. Alleged prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s and business partners of Kiper have acquired assets belonging to a sanctioned Russian businessman, Schemes reported. Kiper denied having business links to them.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-did-ukraines-prosecutor-general-resign-and-who-will-replace-him/	2024-10-24T10:50:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168105618.jpg
Opinion: Canceled Ramstein meeting marks a missed opportunity for Europe to lead on Ukraine	A short trip to Germany instead of the planned state visit. A four-way meeting in the Chancellery instead of the conference in Ramstein to coordinate future aid for Ukraine with some 50 participating states, including numerous heads of state and government. With Hurricane Milton in Florida preventing U.S. President Joe Biden from adhering to his planned itinerary, the entire European political scene was thrown off course. There is no other way to describe the events of the last 14 days. Worse yet, what happened &#x2014; or, more accurately, what didn&#x2019;t happen &#x2014; in Germany exemplifies the desolate state of European foreign and security policy at a critical moment. Why did the Ramstein conference have to be canceled? Was it only because the American president couldn&#x2019;t be there? Were the Europeans not strong enough to host a conference without the participation of the American president, or, if necessary, with the U.S. Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense present? The just-completed German-United Kingdom defense pact suggests that where there is a will, action can be taken. But Europe needs more than such narrowly tailored bilateral agreements, no matter how positive they can be. The reason is abundantly clear: Ukraine is desperately waiting for more help. The third winter of the war Russian President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022 is just around the corner, and the country&#x2019;s situation is getting worse by the week. That Ukraine will get &#x201C;all the help it needs, and it will get it for as long as it needs it,&#x201D; has been the routine refrain heard in most European capitals, especially from the German government, for two and a half years. But this claim is simply wrong, no matter how many times it is repeated. The history of aid to Ukraine is a history of constant dithering and hesitation, of stalling and tactics. When nothing else helps, the American president is called upon to break the political logjam.

(Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images)But Biden spent much of this year, before his withdrawal from the presidential race, on the campaign trail. Now he is on a farewell tour. A new president will be elected on Nov. 5, and if his name is Donald Trump, there will be no slipstream for the Europeans to hide in. The canceled Ramstein conference would have been the perfect opportunity for Europe to at long last take the lead. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz should have shown what the &quot;Zeitenwende&quot; (&#x201C;turning point&#x201D;) which Scholz declared following Russia&#x2019;s invasion means for Europe as a whole. Together with France and Great Britain, he should have made clear statements to Putin: If you did not end your war of terror against Ukraine&#x2019;s civilian population within 24 hours, they could have said, the range limits on the weapons being supplied to Ukraine will be lifted. If that were not enough, it could have been added that Germany would supply Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine to help destroy the Russian army&#x2019;s supply routes into the country. France and Great Britain are already supplying cruise missiles with the range needed to hit the Russian army&#x2019;s supply lines and are apparently prepared to go down this path. Fear and the desperate hope of being able to portray himself as a &#x201C;peace chancellor&#x201D; shortly before Germany&#x2019;s federal election next year have become Scholz&#x2019;s dominant motives. But &#x201C;fear is the mother of all cruelty,&#x201D; as Michel de Montaigne, the sixteenth-century French philosopher, put it. French President Emmanuel Macron has no doubt read Montaigne and understands that warning. Instead of acting decisively at Ramstein, Scholz had a nice coffee with Biden, shortly before the U.S. president was awarded the special level of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. But that award ceremony was a moment that united Great Britain, France, Germany, and the U.S. merely in nostalgia, not in defining the decisive action and sense of purpose which Europe needs today. Indeed, the ceremony recalled nothing so much as how Germany&#x2019;s government behaved in the years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, before the division of Europe was overcome, before the war in Ukraine. The old Europe of the Cold War sought comfort in the past and confidence in the solitary U.S. leadership that defined the era. Europeans forging their own decisions were rarely even an afterthought back then. For example, did no one even think of inviting Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to the meeting in Berlin? Biden&#x2019;s flight back to Washington following the aborted Ramstein conference and the diminished meeting in Berlin&#x2019;s Chancellery may take on an almost symbolic significance in the future: the last Atlanticist U.S. president for a long time bidding farewell to Europe. And the Europeans, without leadership and without the slightest idea of what lies ahead, waving goodbye to him, dreamily reminiscing about earlier times.

First North Korean troops deployed to front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine's military intelligence says	The first North Korean soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been deployed to the front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Oct. 23. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov has been appointed to supervise the training and adaptation of the North Korean troops, who are given &quot;a few weeks&quot; to adjust, according to HUR&apos;s report. The North Korean military is provided with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing, footwear, and hygiene products. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, each soldier receives 50 meters of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month. Ukrainian intelligence claimed that Russia has &quot;high hopes&quot; for the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war. North Korea has denied reports of North Korean troop presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. Additionally, South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-north-korean-troops-deployed-to-front-line-in-kursk-oblast-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-24T10:02:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
US urges G7 to consider sanctions on Russian palladium, titanium, Bloomberg says	The United States has urged its G7 allies to consider sanctions on Russian palladium and titanium, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 23, citing an unnamed source. Officials from U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration raised the possibility of these sanctions during a G7 deputy finance ministers meeting on Oct. 22 in Washington, D.C. The U.S. proposed initiating discussions to further weaken Russia&apos;s economy, according to the source. Palladium is essential for producing computer chips and car catalysts, while titanium is critical for manufacturing airplanes and medical implants. However, Europe&#x2019;s reliance on these metals poses a significant challenge. G7 members Germany, France, and Italy would need support from the other 24 European Union members to impose such sanctions. Washington has already blacklisted Russian titanium, but these metals are vital to global supply chains, and Western governments are cautious about potential market disruptions. The West has long struggled to determine its approach to sanctioning Russian metals. In December, palladium prices rose 12% amid speculation of future sanctions after London imposed restrictions on certain Russian metals. Earlier this year, the U.S. and U.K. imposed sanctions on Russian aluminum, copper, and nickel.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-g7-to-consider-sanctions-on-russian-palladium-titanium-bloomberg-says/	2024-10-24T09:11:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-959103712.jpg
Zelensky won’t sign bill to end daylight saving time, media says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has no plans to sign a bill abolishing seasonal daylight saving time in Ukraine, BBC Ukraine reported on Oct. 24, citing anonymous sources. Parliament passed the bill on July 16, which aimed to cancel daylight saving time in Ukraine. This means that Ukrainians would set their clocks back one hour for the last time on Oct. 27, 2024, and will not revert back to summer time next spring. The bill, signed by parliamentary speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, was sent to Zelensky on Aug. 21 but remains unsigned. BBC sources in both the president&apos;s team and the parliamentary presidential faction confirmed the bill will not be signed. The bill, lobbied by Stefanchuk, will not be vetoed but will also not be enacted. The government reportedly calculated losses from the change at &quot;several billion hryvnias.&quot; Many countries in Europe, North America, and elsewhere have adopted daylight saving time to make better use of longer daylight in summer. The clock is set forward by one hour in the spring and then reverted back in autumn. The continued use of the practice has been hotly debated in the EU, and 84% of respondents polled in 2018 spoke in favor of its abolishment. While the European Parliament voted in 2021 to cancel the system, no final decision has been taken and the practice remains in use in much of Europe. In spite of this, Ukrainian lawmakers presented the change as a step toward EU integration.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wont-sign-bill-to-end-daylight-saving-time-media-says/	2024-10-24T08:32:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
Auchan in final negotiations with local buyer to exit Russian market, media reports	Auchan, one of the few French chains still operating in Russia, is in final negotiations to sell its Russian subsidiary to a local buyer, French media La Lettre reported on Oct. 24. In March 2022, Auchan CEO Yves Claude told the outlet Journal du Dimanche that the company would not leave Russia despite accusations of financing the war, citing the need to keep employees and continue &quot;feeding the populations of both Ukraine and Russia.&quot; At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly accounted for 10% of Auchan&apos;s global sales. Claude also noted that 30,000 people, including 40% of employees and shareholders, could lose their jobs if the company exited the market. The holding company Mulliez, which owns Auchan, is expected to finalize the sale in the coming weeks. The buyer has not been named. Auchan will also need approval from Russian commissions. Auchan is reportedly eager to sell as Russia&apos;s &quot;exit tax&quot; has increased from 10% to 15%, with the potential to reach 35%, according to La Lettre, citing RBC Russian. Selling just the assets would bring less than 200 million euro ($216 million), but the sale of 94 hypermarkets and 138 supermarkets, including the buildings, could increase the value significantly. Auchan, which has 43 stores in Ukraine, also remains active in the country. Sales in Russia and Ukraine, which fell 4.2% last year, dragged down Auchan Retail&#x2019;s overall performance by 2%. Without these countries, growth would have been 4%. The company posted a net loss of 378 million euro ($408 million) for the year. French media Le Figaro reported that Auchan has struggled over the past 2.5 years due to tough competition from Russian oligarch-owned distributors.	https://kyivindependent.com/auchan-in-final-negotiations-with-local-buyer-to-exit-russian-market-media-reports/	2024-10-24T07:27:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239550139.jpg
‘I want to come home as a hero’ – Ukraine’s convict soldiers prepare to fight Russia	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. DONETSK OBLAST &#x2013; Sitting around in the long, dry grass outside an abandoned village house, two dozen men in summer military fatigues listen attentively to a morning lesson. &#x201C;We engage here. These people who were in these positions here run 20 meters across the open area and defend here,&#x201D; lectures the young instructor, flicking his marker across the whiteboard to represent rifle fire. &#x201C;If we need to withdraw, our friend throws two grenades on the move and retreats here.&#x201D; Sergeant Vadym &#x201C;Malyi,&#x201D; 26, is no stranger to teaching the bare bones of infantry tactics to new recruits. &#x201C;Now, in order to storm you, the scum needs to get out of the trenches,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;This area, 20 meters, is out in the open. What does it give us? A chance to kill this guy.&#x201D; Ex-prisoner soldiers of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Vadym&#x2019;s students, wearing the most basic standard issue pixel camouflage, are no ordinary Ukrainian infantrymen: just a few months earlier, they were all behind bars, serving out sentences in the country&#x2019;s prison system. These men make up the 5th Assault Company of Ukraine&#x2019;s 1st Separate Assault Battalion, named after its late commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, better known as &#x201C;Da Vinci.&#x201D; A year and a half after Russia first began filling out its ranks with former convicts, Ukraine, beset by chronic manpower shortages and struggling to draft enough soldiers through recruiting and mobilization, finally turned to its own prison population when parliament passed the respective law allowing them to serve in May. Unlike among the general civilian population, the recruitment of prisoners is done on a volunteer basis only, and even then, those serving time for serious crimes such as rape, multiple murders, or crimes against the security of Ukraine are barred from signing up. According to Ukrainian authorities, by the end of July, around 3,800 former prisoners had been recruited and spread among the Armed Forces&#x2019; existing fighting formations in special units like this. &#xA0; Scenes from the daily life of ex-prisoner Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the company &#x2014; already the second such unit in the Da Vinci battalion &#x2014; as it prepared for its first combat missions in southern Donetsk Oblast, just as Russian forces further ramped up offensive efforts in the area. &#x201C;People mobilized nowadays often do not know where they are going, and not many have a desire to continue service here and really defend their home,&#x201D; Vadym said. &#x201C;So when these people came to us, those who were sentenced, it was a flow of new energy; they are really motivated, they still want to destroy the scum and defend their country.&#x201D; As the lecture concludes, the prisoners are let go for a lunch break before a planned training session on the firing range. Lunch here looks very different from that which the ex-convicts would have eaten in prison, often called the &#x201C;zone&#x201D; in post-Soviet prison slang. It&#x2019;s not even about the food, which the men cook themselves, but about the circumstances of relative freedom in which they live in general. Lodging up in village houses not too far from the contact line, there is little that now distinguishes the company from other soldiers living in the village.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;As they took us from the zone to the base, in an ordinary bus, I was in awe,&#x201D; said Oleksii &#x201C;Blondie,&#x201D; 25, as he helped himself to a bowl of instant noodles and cured pig fat. &#x201C;After five years in jail &#x2014; I had been so young when they put me away &#x2014; I was free.&#x201D; Oleksii sports a light blond buzzcut, and, like many in the company, had been serving time for robbery: a seven-year sentence at age 20. &#x201C;I&apos;m an orphan, I have no parents, only a grandmother. I&apos;ve never sat on anyone&apos;s lap, I tried to buy everything I wanted for myself,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And where would I get the money? By stealing.&#x201D; Although they haven&#x2019;t fought yet as a unit here, many of the men already got a very brief glimpse of combat experience in short stints in Ukraine&#x2019;s 152nd or 153rd mechanized brigades, which had initially recruited them from prison before they were transferred to the Da Vinci battalion. Oleksii, an ex-prisoner soldier of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Oleksii only saw a couple of combat missions, both in Kharkiv Oblast, in the first months of Russia&#x2019;s repeat offensive there. Now, he looks forward to the end of the war, to a chance to begin a different life, one in which he is not stigmatized by society as a simple criminal. &#x201C;Look, I&apos;ve been in prison for five years,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I wanted to be released not as a convict, but to come home as a hero. Not to be released and come home as the same piece of s*** that arrived.&#x201D; Further down the village road is the house &#x2014; or rather, car &#x2014; now home to Volodymyr, who goes by the callsign &#x201C;Champion.&#x201D; Still shirtless upon first meeting, Volodymyr sports two tattoos of eight-pointed stars near his shoulders, a symbol of authority in prison.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Speaking to the Kyiv Independent with a focused, thoughtful temperament, Volodymyr recalls how the full-scale war gave him a new drive to turn his life around. &#x201C;At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, I wrote a statement to the President to beg for forgiveness,&#x201D; he recalled. &#x201C;There are a lot of people in the zone who really want to defend the country and wrote statements from the first day to release them.&#x201D; Two years passed with no reply, but in 2024 the decision was finally made, out of necessity dictated by the bleak manpower shortage on the battlefield. &#x201C;We are different in size from the country of the aggressor,&#x201D; said Vadym, &#x201C;that&apos;s why we need to protect everyone and make it possible to benefit the country.&#x201D; &#x201C;But also to benefit even those people who have been sentenced. They can spend their lives with the deeds accomplished and their dignified time here in the army.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, I was imprisoned in my homeland. But it&apos;s my fault. I have to change my attitude towards other people,&#x201D; said Volodymyr. &#x201C;To be honest, I don&apos;t consider myself a hero. But I have to change something. To change myself.&#x201D; Smoke rises from a sunflower field near a training ground in Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 12, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Shaking old habitsAs the men wrap up their lunch and prepare to head to the training ground, a commotion begins outside one of the houses. Disobeying strict rules against the consumption of alcohol for the ex-convict soldiers, one of them is caught with a bottle of spirits, not for the first time. Calling the rest of the company over to the yard for a chat, Vadym decides to make an example of this case, sending the man to solitary confinement in a cellar. As sincere as the motivations of many of the ex-convicts might be, discipline is still a major issue in companies like this. These final days before their first combat missions are crucial. To survive on the battlefield, Vadym says, they will need not only to train hard, but more importantly, to step away from prison culture and mindset, defined by the slang word &#x201C;poniattia&#x201D; (&#x201C;concepts&#x201D;).

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Once the whole company forms a circle in the yard, the sergeant begins his speech. &#x201C;We have a general problem,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;we have people who still live with their concepts that you had in the zone.&#x201D; &#x201C;Understand, those concepts must stay there. Here we are like children. We have just been born, and now we will show ourselves.&#x201D; The prisoners listen, mostly in silence, though some interject with mumbles of approval. &#x201C;There are plenty of issues with discipline, about how they orient themselves; many just do not understand where they are yet,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;some really wanted to defend their country, but some just wanted to leave the zone.&#x201D; A former theater worker in Kyiv, 47-year-old Oleh &#x201C;Udav,&#x201D; also serving time for robbery, never got used to the internal laws and concepts of prison life. When army recruiters came to his prison, he saw a chance to escape that world and begin a difficult journey back to normal life, where his wife and daughter were waiting. &#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t feel free, because I&#x2019;m not at home,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen my parents, my daughter.&#x201D; Oleh, &quot;Udav,&quot; an ex-prisoner soldier of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Now, although prison culture is still all around him in the unit, Oleh is focused on the great unknown ahead of him: battle. &#x201C;I watch a lot of videos on YouTube,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I watch how the trenches are stormed, and how to work in an urban area. I watch everything about the fighting.&#x201D; &#x201C;Psychologically, I prepare myself for it. But I am not worried, I&apos;m not afraid of death. I&apos;m a sane person. I want to live. I want to see tomorrow.&#x201D; In the yard, Vadym&#x2019;s speech continues. &#x201C;We could already get the order now that tomorrow five people need to head to the position, and that&#x2019;s it, off you go,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;And then again, you will say, &#x2018;we are not ready, we are this and that,&#x2019; because we spent our time on these domestic issues, these explanations I have to give you now. &#x201D; &#x201C;Out there, they will f*** us, when here, among us, we could have solved these issues.&#x201D; The last gasp of autumn heat sun bears down on the burnt grass of the training range outside the village. &#x201C;Forward! Shift left!&#x201D; Vadym&#x2019;s commands ring out as five men carry out squad-level movement drills on the hillside before moving on to live fire. Awkward in their movement and sometimes slow to remember the basic drills, the ex-convicts still look a little ragtag in action, but they run hard and pay close attention to the head sergeant&#x2019;s corrections. In the following days, after refining their moving and firing as a group, they will move on to orientation drills with a compass, before mastering Kropyva, the Ukrainian battlefield mapping software.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)In between drills, Vadym continues to speak to his new recruits. &#x201C;In our army, no one thinks about the fighters. A fighter is a unit. For some, it is a valuable unit,&#x201D; he says, &#x201D;It is a rarity. They will keep them, impart knowledge, teach them to survive.&#x201D; &#x201C;But for someone else, they will be just a unit, which they will send wherever. In this battalion, we do not do this.&#x201D; In these words lies an issue at the heart of whether these men will live to see freedom and amnesty when hostilities end: their treatment by command. When Russia&#x2019;s Wagner mercenary group first started recruiting tens of thousands of prisoners into its ranks, they were famously used as the most expendable of assault troops: walking slowly forward in small groups towards Ukrainian lines, forbidden to retreat with threats of execution, and rarely surviving beyond their first combat mission.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)As far removed as the Ukrainian command is from the style of Wagner, the similar issue of prisoners&#x2019; lives being treated with less value can still rear its head: when commanders are given control of a prisoner unit, they are more likely to give them the most dangerous missions to protect the others. &#x201C;It&apos;s not like we have some separate operations for them and for civilians who came from home,&#x201D; Vadym said to the Kyiv Independent, &#x201C;No, we all have the same operations.&#x201D; &#x201C;We are all here in equal conditions. We don&apos;t have what we have behind us, only what (the knowledge and experience) we have gathered here.&#x201D; Ex-prisoner soldiers of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a training ground in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023.

South Korea could 'review' ban on supply of lethal arms to Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol says	South Korea could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities,&quot; President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 24. &quot;If North Korea dispatches special forces to the Ukraine war, we will provide support to Ukraine step by step and consider taking necessary measures for the security of the Korean Peninsula,&quot; Yoon said in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Seoul. &quot;We have adhered to a principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, but we can review this more flexibly depending on North Korean military activities,&quot; he added. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Both Yoon and Duda denounced the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia, describing it as a &quot;direct violation of the U.N. Charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions,&quot; in comments reported by South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency. &quot;(South Korea) will never sit idle over this and take necessary measures step by step in coordination with the international community depending on the development of N. Korea-Russia military cooperation,&quot; Yoon added. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but has been indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent earlier this week said South Korea is unlikely to begin supplying weapons directly anytime soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; Yoon&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. The U.S. publicly confirmed for the first time on Oct. 23 that it had evidence that North Korean troops were in Russia, with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying it &quot;remains to be seen&quot; if they would join the fighting. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-could-review-ban-on-supply-of-lethal-arms-to-ukraine-president-yoon-suk-yeol-says/	2024-10-24T06:45:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1615679495.jpg
Cargo plane shot down in Sudan with suspected Russian crew may have been supplying weapons, Reuters reports	A cargo plane shot down in Sudan earlier this week may have had a Russian crew and was supplying weapons and ammunition to the country&apos;s army, Reuters reported on Oct. 24, citing sources and documents from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Sudan&apos;s paramilitary RSF claimed to have shot down a cargo plane in Darfur on Oct. 21, with speculation at the time that Russian nationals may have been on board. The aircraft was identified as an Il-74 transport plane that was used to supply weapons, ammunition and provisions to the city of Al Fashir in Sudan, where the Sudanese army is trying to repel RSF&apos;s attacks, an RSF source told Reuters. It is not yet known what route the plane was taking and under what circumstances it was shot down. It had just made a delivery when hit, according to Reuters&apos; source. The crew may have included 67-year-old Russian Viktor Granov, who allegedly had ties to Russian infamous arms dealer Viktor Bout who was released in a prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. in 2022. Previously, Granov reportedly ran two airlines that were accused of violating the arms embargo in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Remnants of documents found at the scene also suggest 33-year-old Russian Anton Selivanets was also on board the downed plane, Reuters wrote, citing footage shared by the RSF. The RSF also sent the news agency a video they said came from a mobile phone recovered from the plane. Reuters identified one of the men in the footage as a 61-year-old Russian Alexander Kabanov, who posted the same video to his social media accounts over a year ago. According to Kabanov&apos;s accounts, he served in the elite airborne troops and spent several years in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan and South Sudan. Reuters could not confirm who the phone belonged to.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-shot-down-in-sudan-with-russians-on-board-may-have-been-used-to-supply-weapons-reuters-reports/	2024-10-24T06:21:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1451403418.jpg

Ukrainian military considering creation of new cyber army branch	Ukrainian military, lawmakers, and experts discussed the creation of a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to cyberspace operations, the General Staff said on Oct. 24. &quot;The creation of Cyber Forces as a separate branch will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, ensure effective planning and implementation of the full range of tasks in cyberspace, which, along with land, sea, air and space, is recognized as a separate operational domain,&quot; the statement read. The participants of the meeting reviewed the main provisions of a draft concept of the branch, and defined the main functions and tasks of any future cyber army. They also examined the experience of Western cyber forces, and analyzed the relevant experience of the Ukrainian army during Russia&apos;s all-out war. At the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine launched an IT army, which was joined by thousands of specialists in the first days of February 2022. It has reportedly carried out multiple cyberattack on Russian online websites.Russian hackers have also regularly targeted various Ukrainian government institutions as well as businesses with crippling cyberattacks aimed at disrupting numerous industries and government services.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considering/	2024-10-24T05:10:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2116861031.jpg
China 'not aware' of North Korean troops in Russia preparing to fight in Ukraine	China on Oct. 24 said it was &quot;not aware&quot; of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beijing&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian made the statement despite the U.S., Seoul and Kyiv all confirming their presence in recent days. When asked at a daily news briefing if China had seen evidence of North Korean troops inside Russia, Jin said &quot;the Chinese side is not aware of the situation.&quot; &quot;China&apos;s position on the Ukrainian crisis has been consistent and clear, and we hope all parties will promote a de-escalation of the situation and commit themselves to a political solution,&quot; the spokesperson added, in comments reported by Reuters. On Oct. 23, the U.S. made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea. Later that day, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game.&quot; &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-not-aware-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia-preparing-to-fight-in-ukraine/	2024-10-24T04:23:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157665737.jpg
US should consider 'direct military action' if North Korean troops enter Ukraine, Intel Committee Chair says	The U.S. should &quot;seriously consider taking direct military action against&#x2026; North Korean troops&quot; if they enter Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said. In an Oct. 23 statement, Turner, a Republican party representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, called on the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to &quot;make clear&quot; that Pyongyang joining Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion would be a &quot;red line for the United States.&quot; Earlier in the day, the U.S. publicly confirmed for the first time that it had evidence that North Korean troops were in Russia, with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying it &quot;remains to be seen&quot; if they would join the fighting. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22. &quot;Now that Secretary Austin has finally acknowledged that North Korean troops are in Russia preparing to enter the conflict with Ukraine, the Biden-Harris Administration must make clear that North Korean troops entering this conflict are a red line for the United States,&quot; Turner said. &quot;If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops.&quot; The comments from Turner are the strongest by far from a U.S. politician on the matter and come less than two weeks before Kamala Harris, Biden&#x2019;s vice president, is to square off for the presidency in an election where she faces Donald Trump from the Republican party. Trump, who seeks a return to the presidency, has expressed fondness for Russian President Vladimir Putin and questions future U.S. military assistance for Ukraine while insisting he can broker a swift peace agreement. And while rhetoric between Democrats and Republicans is escalating ahead of the hotly contested vote, Turner has been a consistent supporter of Ukraine during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In February, he was part of a bipartisan delegation that visited Kyiv to express solidarity with Ukraine as a military aid bill remained tied up in Congress due to political infighting. On Oct. 23, the White House said North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game.&quot; &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3,000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; &quot;We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we&apos;re certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic move, and on how we might respond,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I expect to have more to share on all of that in the coming days,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-should-consider-direct-military-action-if-north-korean-troops-enter-ukraine-intel-committee-chair-says/	2024-10-24T03:45:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg

4 Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian forces near Selydove, Prosecutor General's Office reports	Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Oct. 24. In a post on Telegram, it said the four members of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard were fighting near the town when they were taken prisoner during a Russian attack on Oct. 6. Russian soldiers filmed their interrogations, but when the positions were recaptured by Ukrainian forces on Oct. 7, their bodies were discovered. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has opened a pre-trial investigation into the incident. There have been multiple reports of the executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers during the full-scale invasion, but they have increased dramatically over the last year. Videos and photos have documented potential war crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops. Other videos and photos point to torture and violent death in Russian captivity. As of Oct. 18, Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. Andrii Kostin, the former Prosecutor General, said that the executions of Ukrainian POWs were not isolated incidents, but a purposeful policy&quot; of Russia, citing the audio recordings obtained by Kyiv.Selydove, a town located 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Pokrovsk, has become a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent weeks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-killed-4-ukrainian-pows-near-selydove-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-24T01:24:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168107336.jpg
Lukashenko dismisses North Korean troop reports, says it would 'escalate' Russia's war in Ukraine	The involvement of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine would be &quot;a step towards escalation,&quot; Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with the BBC published on Oct. 23. Speaking on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Lukashenko dismissed reports that North Korea had sent its soldiers to aid Russia&apos;s war effort, describing them as &quot;rubbish.&quot; &quot;Knowing his character (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia&#x2019;s special operation in Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be a step towards the escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of any country, even Belarus, were on the contact line.&quot; According to Lukashenko, the West could respond to such a move by deploying NATO troops in Ukraine. &quot;Even if we got involved in the war this would be a path to escalation. Why? Because you, the Anglo-Saxons, would immediately say that another country had got involved on one side... so Nato troops would be deployed to Ukraine.&quot; While Belarus, an ally of Russia, hasn&apos;t directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Earlier in October, Budanov said that the first group would consist of 2,600 soldiers. Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin confirmed on Oct. 23 that North Korean soldiers are in Russia without elaborating on their numbers and tasks. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

At least 7 countries resisting Ukraine's NATO membership invitation, Politico reports	Seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, Politico reported on Oct. 23, citing four anonymous U.S. and NATO officials and diplomats. While Germany and the U.S. are already known to have reservations about the move, the outlet reported that Belgium, Slovenia, and Spain are &quot;hiding behind&quot; those two countries, and slow-walking President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s ongoing request. In mid-October, Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 17 that the alliance does not currently have such plans. &quot;Countries like Belgium, Slovenia or Spain are hiding behind the U.S. and Germany. They are reluctant,&quot; one of the NATO officials told Politico. The nations &quot;support it in the abstract, but once it gets closer to materializing&quot; they will start to oppose the idea more publicly, they added. Two other countries &#x2014; Hungary and Slovakia &#x2014; are not backing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership due to their pro-Kremlin leanings, Politico reported. Zelensky said earlier this week that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; he said at a meeting with journalists, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-7-countries-resist/	2024-10-23T23:26:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204.jpg

Moscow court sentences Ukrainian-born film producer to 8 and a half years in absentia for reporting on Russian war crimes	Moscow&apos;s Basmanny district court sentenced Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky, on Oct. 21, to 8 and a half years in absentia for &quot;spreading fake information&quot; about the Russian Army. Rodnyansky worked in Russia for decades, and fled after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion started in 2022. The 63-year-old Oscar-nominated producer was accused of reporting on the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and other attacks on civilian infrastructure throughout the war. Rodnyansky stated that the case stemmed from his &quot;anti-war posts on Instagram,&quot; expressing strong disagreement with the verdict. &quot;No Basmanny court can stop me from speaking loudly,&quot; he said on Telegram. &#x201C;The prosecutor said in her speech that my posts &#x2018;expressed a negative attitude towards the Russian military by characterizing their activities as invasive.&#x2019; And I agree with the prosecutor. And so does the rest of the world. Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine is invasive and despicable.&#x201D; Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s crackdown on dissent since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has seen thousands of his citizens arrested and many jailed. In 2023, at least 21,000 people were targeted by Russia&apos;s &quot;repressive laws&quot; used to &quot;crack down&quot; on anti-war activists,&quot; according to Amnesty International.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-court-sentences-ukrainian-born-film-producer-to-8-and-a-half-years-in-absentia-for-reporting-on-russian-war-crimes/	2024-10-23T21:28:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/rodnyansky.jpeg
Germany's Finance Minister suggests revising legal status and benefits for Ukrainian refugees	Germany&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner has proposed reevaluating the legal status of Ukrainian refugees, German magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported on Oct. 23. In an interview with the outlet, Lindner suggested lowering welfare costs and increasing employment among those receiving benefits. Lindner said that Ukrainians should not qualify by default for the higher Burgergeld payments, which are typically for residents and cover social and economic needs, even for those not employed. Instead, he recommended offering benefits more aligned with asylum seekers, combined with labor market integration tools. &quot;They should not automatically receive Burgergeld,&quot; Lindner said. The topic of benefits for Ukrainian refugees has recently caused debate among German officials. More than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have already found jobs in Germany through the government&apos;s Jobturbo program, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a conference with citizens and voters of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Teltow. Germany has taken in more than 1 million refugees from Ukraine since February 2022. Berlin has spent more than 20 billion euros ($21.4 billion) on accommodation and integration of refugees, according to Bloomberg. According to Eurostat, over 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees are currently registered for temporary protection to legally access housing, find work, and receive social benefits in EU states. The EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-finance-minister-suggests-revising-legal-status-and-benefits-for-ukrainian-refugees/	2024-10-23T19:25:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-200515448-001.jpg
Ukraine risks delay in receiving $4.3 billion instalment from EU's Ukraine Facility due to reform shortcomings, Foreign Ministry says	Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis issued a letter to cabinet ministers on Oct. 23 warning that the European Union has notified Ukraine that the next tranche of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) from the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility may be delayed until next year unless expected aspects of corruption reforms are completed by the end of this month. &quot;The EU stated that if Ukraine does not finish all internal procedures to approve and adopt the law by the end of October 2024, the 4 billion euros financing will be re-allocated for the following year,&quot; Perebyinis wrote in the letter. The initial payment, scheduled to be dispersed in November, risks delay amid stalled progress on improving regulations for plea agreements in corruption cases. The necessary changes to Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code were supposed to have been finished by the third quarter of 2024, however, they were only approved by parliament in the first reading on Oct. 9. It was not immediately clear as to when the payment would be postponed until if Ukraine&apos;s parliament fails to fully adopt the new changes. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the European Union created a list of reforms Ukraine must implement as a necessary step toward Kyiv&apos;s accession into the alliance. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill reforming the State Customs Service and introduced to tackle corruption and save funds otherwise lost to smuggling, with a myriad of other reforms ongoing. The Ukraine Facility, approved by the EU in February, allocates 33 billion euros ($36 billion) in loans and 17 billion euros ($18 billion) in grants to Kyiv. The EU Council approved the framework agreement in mid-May, setting out the Ukrainian government&apos;s tasks for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization.The besieged country received $42.5 billion in external financing from various donors last year, allowing it to function amid the ongoing war. The International Monetary Fund said Ukraine will need roughly the same sum to support its budget this year. According to Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko, the current pledges are still not sufficient to cover the country&apos;s needs, adding that Ukraine will likely need an additional $12-15 billion in foreign financial support next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/mfa-ukraine-risks/	2024-10-23T15:36:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1785291162.jpg
Controversial chief of staff for Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces dismissed months after appointment, Ukrainska Pravda reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Roman Hladkyi, the controversial Chief of Staff of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), was dismissed from his position just months after being appointed to the post in August 2024, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Oct. 23, citing Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. Hladyki was appointed Chief of Staff of USF on Aug. 30 after being dismissed from his position as the Chief of Staff of the Navy due to a scandal in April 2018. The Navy&apos;s press service stated that Hladkyi&apos;s dismissal was due to &quot;shortcomings in official activities following an inspection of a military unit by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry.&quot; &quot;As a result of an investigation conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine, it was determined that Roman Hladkyi&apos;s continued tenure as Chief of Staff of the Unmanned Systems Forces of Ukraine was untenable,&quot; the Defense Ministry told Ukrainska Pravda in a statement following his most recent dismissal. &quot;This decision was made following all necessary procedures and thorough checks, with the aim of enhancing the unit&apos;s effectiveness and its ability to meet modern challenges,&quot; the statement added. According to the statement, the decision was made on Oct. 14 and Hladyki has since been transferred to a reserve battalion. No additional details were immediately available on Hladkyi&apos;s dismissal. Following his appointment to the post in August, Ukrainian lawmakers criticized the appointment. Mariana Bezuhla, formerly a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, questioned how Hladkyi, a native of Crimea and a Navy captain with a questionable reputation, passed the Security Service vetting process and was appointed to such a high position. Bezuhla also alleged that Hladkyi is &quot;a suspect in high treason, espionage, and corruption,&quot; though law enforcement agencies had not officially confirmed this.Prior to his first dismissal in 2018, Ukrainian media also reported allegations that Hladkyi&apos;s wife held Russian citizenship and lived in Russian-occupied Crimea, and that his daughter participated in swimming competitions for the Central Sports Club of the Russian Army. In 2018, the Defense Ministry denied that information about Hladkyi&apos;s family members was the basis for an internal investigation. Colonel Oleksii Halabuda, the former commander of the 28th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was appointed to replace Hladkyi, the Defense Ministry said. During Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, transforming modern warfare. For the outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have become crucial in targeting Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind enemy lines.Ukraine officially established its Unmanned Systems Forces on June 11, four months after President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree to create a separate branch of the armed forces dedicated to enhancing drone operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/successor-chosen-for-controversial-chief-of-staff-of-the-unmanned-systems-forces-ukrainska-pravda-says/	2024-10-23T13:48:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793922.jpg
Belarus schedules next presidential election for January 2025	Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for January 26, 2025, the country&#x2019;s Central Electoral Commission announced on Oct. 23. Incumbent Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is widely expected to hold on to power following the election&apos;s result. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 per cent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. Following the announcement of the election date, Tsikhanouskaya disavowed the process calling it a &quot;sham with no real electoral process, conducted in an atmosphere of terror.&quot; &quot;No alternative candidates or observers will be allowed. We call on Belarusians and the international community to reject this farce,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya added. Following the 2020 election results, the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus for &quot;repression and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists.&quot; Earlier this year on Aug. 9, the U.K. imposed new sanctions against four Belarusian individuals and three entities on the fourth anniversary of the 2020 presidential election in Belarus. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus hosts Russian troops and missiles on its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-schedules-next-presidential-election-for-january-2025/	2024-10-23T13:04:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1798852424.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US confirms North Korean troops in Russia; Zelensky preparing plan to withstand war	Key developments on Oct. 23: President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked the Ukrainian authorities to develop proposals for an internal action plan to help the country withstand the war, a source close to the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 23. According to the source, the document will address military, political, economic, and other areas, including certain decisions regarding law enforcement. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier in the day, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. &quot;The goal is to do everything possible to maintain unity and achieve results in various areas of the country&apos;s development,&quot; a source in Zelensky&apos;s team told BBC. The plan reportedly is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot; There is evidence that North Korean troops are in Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Rome on Oct. 23, Reuters reported. Austin&apos;s comment comes as the first public confirmation by the U.S. of previous statements by Ukraine and South Korea. The two nations say Russia is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;There is evidence that there are DPRK (North Korean) troops in Russia. What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,&quot; the Pentagon chief said. Austin did not specify the number of North Korean troops that had arrived in Russia. Nearly 3,000 soldiers had been sent to support the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine, and &quot;thousands more&quot; were expected to follow, Reuters reported, citing South Korean intelligence. &quot;Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October,&quot; Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said. &quot;It appears that the troops have now been dispersed to multiple training facilities in Russia and are adapting to the local environment.&quot; Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, according to South Korean military intelligence. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. Ukraine managed to stabilize the situation in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the Russian army continues to concentrate its forces in the eastern part of the town, Anastasiia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 23 on national television. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town became one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The situation in Toretsk has relatively stabilized. We (Ukrainian forces) are now holding the demarcation line unchanged. The enemy is still entrenched in the city&apos;s eastern parts,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, we are holding back their further advance and will defend the town as long as possible. And we are doing a good job of it now.&quot; The number of assaults on this front line&apos;s sector has slightly decreased, which may indicate that Russian troops have taken a tactical pause to possibly replenish manpower, accumulate weapons, and redeploy equipment, Bobovnikova added. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk. London will donate an additional 120 million pounds ($155 million) to the Maritime Capability Coalition to support Ukraine&apos;s Navy, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The move comes as a response to Russia stepping up attacks against port infrastructure in southern Odesa Oblast that resulted in damaged civilian ships and casualties. &quot;Russia&apos;s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The British government accused Russia of threatening global food security, including humanitarian supplies to war-stricken Palestine, just as some Global South leaders gather in the Russian city of Kazan for the BRICS summit. The U.K. is looking for partners to co-finance the supply of &quot;hundreds&quot; more naval drones as well as surveillance radars to protect Ukraine&apos;s grain corridor. London and Oslo are also seeking a further 100 million pounds ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more. As part of the naval coalition, Ukraine has received dozens of amphibious all-terrain vehicles and raiding boats, hundreds of anti-ship missiles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, according to the statement. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 attacks on Ukrainian ports, damaging or destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure, said on Oct. 10. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes. France will deliver its first three Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025, the French newspaper La Tribune reported on Oct. 23, citing its sources. Paris previously confirmed it would begin transferring its aircraft in the first three months of next year but did not comment on the numbers. The timing of delivery takes into account the time needed to train pilots and mechanics and prepare the aircraft, La Tribune wrote. According to the outlet, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry refused to comment for La Tribune. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. The Mirage 2000-5 is a fourth-generation fighter jet, meaning it is in the same class as the U.S.-made F-16 that Ukraine&apos;s Air Force already operates. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first countries to deliver their F-16s, making them the first Western fighter jets in Ukraine&apos;s arsenal. While Kyiv awaits Mirages and additional F-16s, it is also in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-preparing-action-plan-for-ukraine-to-withstand-war-source-says/	2024-10-23T12:59:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Finishing off the defenseless: How the Russians execute Ukrainian soldiers	Warning: This article contains graphic photos and descriptions of graphic scenes. A decomposed human hand with the remains of flesh, bleak and brown save for one splash of color &#x2014; two thin blue-yellow rubber bracelets. The colors of the Ukrainian national flag. The hand was from a body of the hundreds of victims of Russian troops, soldiers, and civilians, exhumed from a mass burial site near the then-just-liberated Izium, a city in Kharkiv Oblast, in September 2022. Captured by journalists, the photo spread worldwide and became a symbol of Russian violence and Ukrainian resistance. Many assumed that the man, soon identified as a Ukrainian soldier Serhii Sova, was killed in battle. Only one person knew that the truth was more grim. Months earlier, Sova&#x2019;s widow saw the photos of her dead husband on Russian Telegram channels. The photos showed he had been shot in the head, his hands tied behind his back. All signs pointed to the fact that he had been executed while in Russian captivity. Still, when his body was found near Izium, it hit her again. A hand of Ukrainian soldier Serhii Sova photographed after his body was found at a mass burial site near Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, after the area&apos;s liberation from Russian forces in September 2022. (Provided by the author)&#x201C;My heart and everything inside me sank,&#x201D; Oksana Sova says, recalling the moment she saw the photos in the media and recognized the bracelet and tattoos on her husband&#x2019;s body. This story is one vivid example of a recently increasing number of public reports of executions of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian forces. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, cases of executions of Ukraine&#x2019;s soldiers began to surge in 2023. Videos and photos of brutal executions have been appearing online more frequently since the spring of 2023. In March 2023, a video was published on Telegram showing Russian soldiers shooting a captive Ukrainian soldier after he said &quot;Glory to Ukraine.&quot; Only a month later, a different video showed Russian soldiers cutting off the head of a Ukrainian soldier as he screamed in pain. At the end of the video, a Russian soldier holds up the severed head. Cases like this continue to surface in 2024, often accompanied by horrendous videos. Some of them feature decapitation and mutilation of bodies. Prisoners of war (POW) are granted protection under international humanitarian law, namely the 4th Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War adopted in 1907. According to the convention, killing a POW constitutes a war crime, and a soldier is considered a POW and cannot be attacked from the moment he lays down his weapon or no longer possesses the means of protection, voluntarily surrenders, or demonstrates such an intention. This also applies to those who find themselves under the power of the enemy, rendered defenseless by unconsciousness, injury, or illness. It&#x2019;s impossible to know how many Ukrainian soldiers have been executed after being taken captive. Recording and investigating such crimes is extremely difficult due to limited access. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the United Nations has documented the execution of 42 Ukrainian service members. Ukraine has documented 102 such executions as of October 2022. The actual figure could be much higher. Even for the cases that have been recorded, justice appears to be a doubtful prospect. Russia doesn&#x2019;t recognize or investigate POW execution cases. In Ukraine, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office has opened 27 investigations into the killing of POWs. So far, only three cases have made it to court, only one of which is being considered in the presence of a Russian soldier and two in absentia. No verdicts have been made yet. The Kyiv Independent has collected testimonies about three executions of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian troops. We received photo evidence of the crimes, which the Russian soldiers themselves distributed on Telegram channels shortly after the execution, a unique video shot from a drone by Ukrainian military officers, and spoke with an eyewitness to an execution who was captured, survived abuse in captivity, and returned to Ukraine. These are their stories. On June 1, 2022, in Donetsk Oblast, near the village of Yarova, at dawn, Russian artillery fired intensely in preparation for an assault on Ukrainian positions. Next, the tanks rolled in. Roman Zarudny, callsign &#x201C;Irishman,&#x201D; a soldier from the National Guard of Ukraine, was at the outpost that was among the first to be attacked. A 32-year-old former circus artist who voluntarily joined the military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, he had been fighting for less than three months at the time of the assault. As he remembers the attacks, Ukrainian soldiers didn&#x2019;t stand a chance. &quot;We should have pulled back because we had nothing to fight with,&#x201D; he recalls. &#x201C;I managed to fire one magazine, then there was smoke, a grenade, a bang &#x2014; and that was the end of my war.&quot; Zarudny was in the dugout with two other infantrymen. One told his comrades he was wounded. &quot;He said, &apos;Guys, I think I&#x2019;m 300&#x2019;,&#x201D; he recalled his comrade saying, using the military code for &#x201C;wounded.&#x201D; &#x201C;We checked, cut off his clothes, and saw his knee and elbow were shot.&quot; The Russian fire subsided as their infantry fighting vehicles moved deeper into the village. The soldiers removed the wounded soldier&apos;s body armor, bandaged him, and considered their next move. It was too late to retreat. &quot;I had already said goodbye to life at that point,&quot; said Zarudny. The Russian troops were approaching the dugout. Zarudny said he didn&#x2019;t want to get captured and recalled one of his comrades echoing him. Zarudny took a hand grenade. &#x201C;I thought &#x2014; if they get in, I could take a few of them with me,&#x201D; recalled Zarudny. Videos and photos of brutal executions of Ukrainian soldiers have been surfacing online with increasing frequency since spring 2023. (Karolina Gulshani / The Kyiv Independent)But after a brief discussion, they decided to surrender. Zarudny recalls that a Russian soldier saw the grenade in his hand, warned him not to use it, and took it away. Then, the Russian soldiers noticed the wounded soldier. &quot;A Russian soldier looked at him, cocked his Kalashnikov, and fired two shots at him,&#x201D; Zarudny recalled. &#x201C;Then, he said: &apos;Don&apos;t take it the wrong way. His legs were shattered. I did it so he wouldn&apos;t suffer. He&#x2019;s better off this way&#x2019;.&quot; The Russian soldiers took the other two soldiers as prisoners. Zarudny was released in a prisoner exchange a year and a half later, in January 2024. The second soldier is still officially listed as a prisoner. As for the third one, he is formally listed as missing. What happened to his body is unknown, and his family is still searching for him, hoping for the best. Soldiers from the Kulchytsky Battalion, who fought alongside Zarudny&#x2019;s brigade on June 1, 2022, confirmed the dramatic turn of events that day, unfavorable for Ukrainian forces. It is one of the most widely recognized photos of Russia&#x2019;s invasion. In September 2022, after the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast, a large burial site was found in the forest near the city of Izium &#x2014; the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, killed by Russians. Soon after, Ukrainian authorities began their exhumation. One of the bodies exhumed drew the attention of the media on site: Its half-decomposed wrist carried a rubber bracelet in the colors of the Ukrainian national flag. The photo flew around the world. Oksana Sova from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, recognized her husband, 35-year-old serviceman Serhii Sova, in the photographs. By that time, he had been officially listed as missing for almost five months, since April 19, 2022. When the body was found in September, Oksana already knew her husband was dead. Workers exhume a body at a mass burial site containing around 440 graves in liberated Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. (Kostyantyn Chernichkin / The Kyiv Independent)Oksana has never shared the story of how she found out what happened to her husband until now. Nor has she discussed what she experienced in the days since she learned that he had gone missing. &quot;Every single day, I was checking Russian Telegram channels, looking for prisoners, the dead, everyone,&#x201D; she recalls. &#x201C;After a month, in May, I found what I was looking for.&#x201D; Scrolling through Telegram channels, Oksana came upon familiar features. In the photo, her husband was stripped down to the waist, his hands tied behind his back. In the back of his head, a gaping gunshot wound. The nature of the photo, the absence of clothes, the tied hands &#x2014; all pointed to the fact that Russian soldiers had killed Serhii when he was already captured and should have been protected as a POW. &#x201C;It was a photo taken after his execution,&#x201D; Oksana says. &#x201C;In the photo, he was very thin &#x2014; my husband was never that thin. I kept looking... It was tough in the first days. I noticed that these bastards had taken everything. There were no silver chains with the pendants I had given him, no belt, no boots.&quot; There could be no mistake in identifying him: The photo showed the soldier&apos;s face and recognizable tattoos on his torso &#x2014; an owl, a samurai, and a sakura. Near Serhii was at least one more dead man, his hands tied behind his back and a t-shirt pulled over his head. The photographs documenting this war crime were later deleted from the Russian Telegram channels, which they had posted along with other photos of captured and executed Ukrainian soldiers with a call urging Ukrainians to surrender in order to survive. Oksana also later deleted the photos from her phone, fearing that her two children would accidentally find them. However, friends of Serhii saved screenshots of the posts and shared them with the Kyiv Independent. The circumstances of the battle during which Serhii was captured are recounted by his comrades, who managed to retreat in time. In April 2022, the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 93rd Brigade was holding positions in tree lines near the villages of Sulyhivka, Dibrivne, and Nova Dmytrivka in the Izium district of Kharkiv Oblast. This location is about 50 kilometers from where Serhii&#x2019;s body would be found in September. &quot;We held the defense there for about two weeks and tried to break through. On April 19, at 2 a.m., we received the order to retreat because we were being encircled. We moved back to another tree line,&#x201D; recalls Yurii, callsign &quot;Pavuk,&quot; who was at that time a squad commander of the 3rd Company, 3rd Platoon, 1st Battalion of the 93rd Brigade. He remembers how the company was repositioning from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when Russian troops saw it and brazenly advanced. Artillery was hitting them from all sides, causing them to scatter before the enemy tanks arrived. Serhii&#x2019;s position was about 100 meters from Yurii, closer to the road. &#x201C;The Russians drove in there with tanks and armored personnel carriers and started destroying everything in sight,&#x201D; he says, adding that he knows of only two men who were taken captive that day. &#x201C;Everyone else who was there died. There were about 40 people. This all happened in about four hours.&quot; Thanks to photographic evidence, which the Russians published on Telegram channels, it became clear that Serhii survived that heavy battle and even remained unharmed, but was executed by Russian soldiers. According to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s sources in Serhii&#x2019;s unit, the 93rd Brigade, the Russian troops that were stationed in the area were from the 4th Tank Kantemirovskaya Division. For Oksana, establishing the truth about what really happened to her loved one and remembering him in a dignified way is vital. Oksana and Serhii had been together for 17 years. They ran a dog training business together. He was a boxer and had served in the Ukrainian army before. He left behind two children: a son, Marat, now 16, and a daughter, Elina, who is 11. &quot;Seventeen years of our life together.

He loved us very much; we were everything to him, and he spent all his free time with the family.&quot; Oksana and Serhii Sova were together for 17 years, running a dog-training business. After joining the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2022, Serhii was executed by Russian troops in Kharkiv Oblast. (Oksana Sova&apos;s archive)Oksana and Serhii Sova with their two children: 16-year-old Marat and 11-year-old Elina. (Oksana Sova&apos;s archive)Many testimonies of executions of prisoners on the battlefield in this war have been captured by aerial footage. The Kyiv Independent obtained a video, according to our sources inside the brigade, dated Feb. 18, 2024, shot in the trenches between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. It shows two unarmed soldiers of the 82nd Separate Air Assault Brigade walking near the trenches before being shot by an automatic firearm moments later. &quot;During the battle, the Russians killed two of our guys. Two more survived. When the Russians entered, our guys raised their hands, but the Russians killed them,&quot; said one of the eyewitnesses who saw what happened that day during a live broadcast from a drone. Executions on a battlefield remain among the least documented deaths in war. This crime extremely rarely leaves witnesses. Units of such cases fall into the lenses of drones or are recorded by the killers. &quot;This has been practiced in the Russian army since the (Second) Chechen War. And they did it very much in many conflicts in which they participated. I think that this is a specially organized practice, and it is aimed at two aspects,&quot; says Volodymyr Yavorskyi, program director of the Ukrainian Nobel Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties. He believes that it&#x2019;s all about spreading fear: firstly among people already on the front lines that they will most certainly die, so they should retreat. Secondly, among those who are expected to be mobilized. &quot;A person sees this and thinks that mobilization is inevitable death,&#x201D; he said. As practice shows, taking or not taking a prisoner in battle depends on various factors, said a 47-year-old major of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces, who we identify only by his callsign &quot;Karay&quot; because he has no official permission to comment on the issue. &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; has witnessed many acts of cruelty during his 10-year service in the war in Ukraine in various brigades. &#xA0; 0:00/1&#xD7;The video shot by a Ukrainian drone shows Ukrainian soldiers moments before their execution by Russian soldiers between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, in February 2024. (Screenshot from a video)&quot;Prisoners can be executed because of the desire to take revenge for fellow servants, or when a group cannot or does not want to spend time on guarding and evacuating prisoners, so they kill them.&#x201D; At the same time, the higher the status of the unit, like Russian marines or paratroopers, the higher the probability that the prisoners will remain alive, &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; said. &#x201C;There is a higher percentage of professional soldiers. For them, war is work, and they avoid emotions.&#x201D; On the other hand, there are some Russian units, such as the &#x201C;Rusich&#x201D; Sabotage-Assault Reconnaissance Group,&#x201D; which publicly declares that they do not take prisoners. They were the ones who published the video featuring the cutting off of the head of a Ukrainian soldier. &quot;In some units, according to radio intercepts, Russian commanders practice involving their soldiers in executions, including with demonstrative brutality, to bind the &quot;team&quot; with blood and crimes so that the soldiers will fight to the last and not surrender to the Ukrainians,&#x201D; &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; said.	https://kyivindependent.com/finishing-off-the-defenseless-how-the-russians-execute-ukrainian-soldiers/	2024-10-23T12:28:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Iryna_POW_Story_3_Smaller.jpg
US to provide $20 billion loan to Ukraine as part of G7 pledge	The U.S. will allocate $20 billion to Ukraine as part of a $50-billion pledge by the Group of Seven (G7), President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 23 in his evening address. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. &quot;This is what will really support us. And it is important to implement it this year, &quot; Zelensky said, thanking the U.S. and the entire G7. Daleep Singh, the White House deputy national security adviser on international economics, said that Joe Biden&apos;s administration intends to split the funds between helping the Ukrainian economy and the military, according to the Associated Press (AP). &quot;To be clear, nothing like this has ever been done before,&quot; Singh said. &quot;Never before has a multilateral coalition frozen the assets of an aggressor country and then harnessed the value of those assets to fund the defense of the aggrieved party, all while respecting the rule of law and maintaining solidarity.&quot; Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the funds from Western partners under this initiative will meet Ukraine&apos;s most important financial needs in 2025. &quot;Thanks to this assistance, our allies are creating a solid foundation for Ukraine&apos;s economic and financial stability,&quot; Shmyhal said. The bulk of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan was supposed to be equally covered by the EU and the U.S., with each economic powerhouse shouldering $20 billion. Japan, the U.K., and Canada would jointly provide the remaining $10 billion. That plan stood on shaky ground as the U.S. was reluctant to commit unless the EU extended the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. Such a step requires an unanimous vote, which is currently being blocked by Hungary, the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly member. As Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to use his veto power in Brussels, the U.S. signaled it might still participate in the loan, albeit for a reduced amount, of around $5 billion, equating to the Russian assets held domestically.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-20-billion-loan-to-ukraine-as-part-of-g7-pledge/	2024-10-23T12:19:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147967390.jpg
UK prepares another group of future Ukrainian F-16 pilots, bringing total number of trainees to 200	Another group of Ukrainian military personnel completed elementary flying training for F-16 fighter jets in the U.K., the British Royal Air Force (RAF) reported on Oct. 22. British instructors have trained a total of 200 Ukrainian pilots so far, according to British Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard. The U.K. and other allies have been training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s at an accelerated pace due to Kyiv&apos;s urgent need for air defense against intensifying Russian bombardments. &quot;The next step is advanced fast jet training and conversion to F-16 with partner nations,&quot; the RAF&apos;s statement read. Pollard and Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.K. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, former commander-in-chief, attended the graduation ceremony. Zaluzhnyi thanked the U.K. government for its continued support, which &quot;gives (Ukraine) a chance to win.&quot; The first group of Ukrainian pilots graduated from a full training course in the U.S. in May, and Denmark prepared 50 Ukrainian F-16 maintenance specialists in June. Yet, only 11 F-16 pilots are currently flying in Ukraine, though a full squadron consists of 40. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July, one year after Denmark, the Netherlands, and other foreign partners launched a fighter jet coalition for Kyiv. The pace of the training program came into question after a recently delivered F-16 operated by Ukraine&apos;s top pilot, Oleksii Mes, crashed while defending against a Russian drone and missile attack on Aug. 26. Mes, call sign &quot;Moonfish,&quot; was killed in the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prepares-another-group-of-future-ukrainian-f-16-pilots-bringing-total-number-of-trainees-to-200/	2024-10-23T11:31:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Gagzx7pWgAAagZ8.jpeg
Why South Korean weapons are unlikely to be heading directly to Ukraine anytime soon	South Korea has hinted it could change its long-standing stance on not providing Ukraine directly with weapons in light of the dramatic escalation of North Korea&apos;s role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but on Oct. 22, a South Korean government source suggested this could change, and the direct supply of arms was being considered. Earlier, on Oct. 18, South Korea said that Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia was a &quot;grave security threat&quot; and warned that it would &quot;respond by mobilizing all available means in cooperation with the international community.&quot; However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say South Korea&apos;s position is unlikely to change soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;There&apos;s always a bit of posturing that happens in the immediate aftermath of what North Korea is doing, but the actual ability to implement this is very difficult, &quot;Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones. In June, Seoul said it would reconsider this in relation to Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. Publicly, nothing came of this statement, but the recent news of North Korean troops being sent to Russia has raised the issue once again. Citing a South Korean government source, the Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22 that Seoul is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. It also said the government is reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. But the source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly.

(Anthony Wallace / AFP via Getty Images)Town said that despite Seoul&apos;s words, supplying Ukraine directly with weaponry isn&apos;t even an option currently. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; she said, adding: &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; And currently, that seems very unlikely. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. South Korea has a thriving arms industry. And while much of this is fueled by the domestic need to defend against its ever-belligerent northern neighbor, it&apos;s also one of the world&apos;s biggest exporters of weapons. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, South Korea currently ranks 10th in terms of arms exports. In particular, South Korea has a lot of 155mm artillery shells, which Ukraine desperately needs. &quot;In terms of what South Korea could provide directly, the biggest medium-term impact would be ammunition because basically the West is tapped out,&quot; Vann Van Diepen, a consultant and former U.S. State Department official, told the Kyiv Independent. According to Ukrainian officials, just holding the front lines requires 75,000 a month, while fending off another major Russian offensive could double this number. Meanwhile, Russia is firing around 300,000 a month, with North Korea reportedly supplying half of the sum. South Korea has long been under some pressure from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies to send 155mm shells to Ukraine to help fight off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. But restricted by its laws, Seoul had to devise a workaround to contribute. It has done this by indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. The U.S. sends Ukraine shells from its stockpiles, and South Korea sends the U.S. replacements. But the U.S. and European nations have struggled to ramp up production to the rates required to fuel the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, meaning the limiting factor isn&apos;t how many South Korea can send but how many other countries can produce. Van Diepen said that while South Korea produces a range of weapons that would be on Ukraine&apos;s wishlist, there are difficulties and challenges with supplying them, even indirectly. South Korea produces the K9 Thunder self-propelled 155 mm howitzer, though this would require another arrangement with a third country, and there is currently no talk of this. The same applies to the K239 multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), considered to be at least on a par with the U.S.-made HIMARS system, which was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022, allowing Kyiv to target Russian forces in occupied territories far more accurately than they had previously.

Ukraine&apos;s Western partners continue to refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with long-range missiles such as ATACMS and Storm Shadows. &quot;South Korea would likely have the same concerns the U.S. has in terms of escalating things, they&apos;ll be looking over one shoulder in terms of their future relationship with Russia,&quot; Van Diepen said, adding: &quot;There are probably lines that they won&apos;t want to cross.&quot; &quot;So ammunition and artillery would be the most likely.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-south-korean-weapons-are-unlikely-to-be-heading-directly-to-ukraine-anytime-soon/	2024-10-23T11:14:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175191224.jpg
Russia's wartime economy delivers growth, but will the bubble burst?	A recent draft budget submitted to the Russian parliament last month has outlined the Kremlin&apos;s plans to keep spending high in its wartime economy, with ambitions to maintain the steady levels of growth the country has seen since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Surging government spending on war and defense production prompted the International Monetary Fund on Oct. 22 to increase its 2024 growth forecast for Russia to 3.6%. The three-year budget, which plans to further hike military spending to post-Soviet record highs, shows Moscow&apos;s commitment to a long-war. But analysts warn that increased inflation and an ever-worsening labor shortage could see the tide turn on Russia&apos;s sanction-ridden economy. &quot;What we have seen in the past two years is that you can achieve relatively high growth with enormous fiscal support. The problem is you are simply mortgaging your future,&quot; Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and non-resident scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told the Kyiv Independent. After rounds of Western sanctions sent shockwaves through the Russian economy following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, plunging the ruble by over 30% and driving up consumer costs by almost a fifth across the country, the Russian Central Bank introduced tight capital controls, swiftly moving the economy onto a planned wartime footing and allowing the Kremlin to spend its way out of a brief period of recession. &quot;Russia was simply in an extremely resilient position when the full-scale invasion began,&quot; said Janis Kluge, an expert on Russia&apos;s economy with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.&quot; Combined with record revenues that oil and gas brought following the start of the all-out war, this windfall payment provided a safety net for the economy, giving Moscow the ability to increase its spending in certain industries which in turn led to growth in GDP, Kluge added. The draft budget has outlined Moscow&apos;s ambitions to keep those levels of spending high in order to keep its wartime economy afloat. The planned total budget expenditure in 2025 will increase to 41.5 trillion rubles, up roughly 13% from 2024&apos;s 36.6 trillion. Of that sum, almost 41% will be spent on defense and security, outweighing the government&apos;s combined expenditure on education, healthcare, social policy and the national economy. This sum not only highlights Moscow&apos;s readiness to continue its war of aggression with its Westerly neighbor, but also hints at the Kremlin&apos;s awareness that it could take decades to reconstitute its armed forces after nearly 3 years of costly fighting, Dara Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the Kyiv Independent. Though rather than that extra spending being funded by increased oil revenues, at times an almost sole driver of economic growth throughout the presidency of Vladimir Putin, the budget proposals make conservative estimates on oil and gas yields, expecting them to fall to 10.9 trillion roubles in 2025 down from 11.3 trillion roubles expected this year.

(Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images)&quot;We are now trying to minimize the impact of oil prices on the budget. The overall share of cash receipts from the sale of oil and gas in the treasury&apos;s income is decreasing. If a few years ago this figure was 35-40%, then in 2025 it should decrease to 27%, and in 2027 &#x2013; to 23%,&quot; Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the state broadcaster RT Arabic last week. But weaning the economy off its dependence on oil and gas revenues could take years, with the financial system still remaining highly vulnerable in the event of a sudden decrease in the oil and gas price, Kluge said. &quot;If the oil price were to go down, let&apos;s say to below $50 per barrel, this would already have a significant effect on the Russian economy. It would lead to a strong devaluation of the ruble, which in turn would cause more inflation in Russia,&quot; he added. Inflation in Russia has remained high throughout 2024, with the annual figure slowing to 8.63% in August, down slightly from 9.05% in August. To combat these pressures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has kept interest rates high, now set at an unprecedented 19%. According to the prospective budget, much of the cash to fuel that extra spending will come from taxpayers, with hikes in both income and corporation taxes. A gamble that the Kremlin can currently afford to take after two years of overheating in the economy has led to a spike in living standards as well as record-low unemployment, Kolyandr said. &quot;Wherever you look, you see that people get more money, and they are now able to borrow more because yesterday you were a low-paid non-entity, and today you are a proud worker for a tank production facility,&quot; Kolyandr said. In order to fuel its war, the Kremlin has been pumping money into its defense industry, offering thousands of new jobs at inflated salaries. According to President Putin, 520,000 new jobs have opened in the industry in the last 18 months, with social welfare payments for the birth of children and favorable mortgage rates offered to those who take up work in the sector. But even paying three or four times the average salary for the region, the push for more workers continues to run up against a critical shortage of labor across Russia, something analysts warn could beset the country&apos;s economy for years to come. Figures show that Russia&apos;s unemployment rate has fallen approximately 2% since its invasion of Ukraine, reaching record lows of 2.4% in June this year, according to the Federal State Statistics Service (RosStat). With hundreds of thousands of men having been sent to war, and a further 650,000 people fleeing the country since February 2022, according to an investigation by The Bell, the country&apos;s decreased workforce and renewed anti-migrant rhetoric means there are few places left for the Kremlin to find more workers. Anti-migrant campaigns have been steadily growing across Russia since 2021, said Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of the Moscow-based Sova Center, which monitors extremism in Russia. The war in Ukraine, as well as a number of terrorist attacks in the past year, including at a concert hall in Moscow in March that left 145 dead, have only further fuelled this sentiment, he added.

(Stringer/AFP/Getty Images)Russian President Vladimir Putin reacts during the Summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 8, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)&quot;The regime is changing, which opens up more possibilities for Russian nationalists,&quot; Verkhovsky told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;because the regime needs more support from below due to the war, it has to give (those groups) more freedom of actions,&quot; he added. The Russian State Duma is on course to adopt five more laws before December which will further toughen up legislation against migrants, a likely response to the will of the population, Kolyandr said, but only making the problem of labor shortages more acute. &quot;In some ideal world, they would love to import more people to join the labor force from abroad. But given the overall attitude in Russia towards non-white, non-Christian migrants, that would be a problem,&quot; Kolyandr said. The Kremlin has instead outlined its intention for the economy to adapt to new, lower levels of unemployment whilst increasing its levels of productivity. This is unlikely to be able to overcome its shortage of workers, though, given the wide range of technological sanctions making it difficult for Russia to get its hands on the much-needed high-tech machinery, Kluge said. &quot;The cost of labor for companies is increasing a lot. For example, some retailers are trying to do more with things like digital cashiers. But at the same time, there are limits to this because of sanctions, because Russia is not able to acquire many of the machines that you would need to replace humans in production,&quot; he said. All of this makes the long-term economic outlet potentially pretty grim for the Kremlin, analysts said, though much of that will depend on external factors such as the geopolitical situation and the global oil price. What is clear, though, is that eventually, Russia will arrive at a point that pumping money into its economy will no longer be able to yield the returns it has over the last two and half years of war, Kolyandr said. &quot;Due to constraints in the economy, eventually you cannot invest in more production, you cannot hire more people. At a certain point, you increase your fiscal spending, but it doesn&apos;t lead to high economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like binge drinking. At some point, you drink another glass of wine, and it doesn&apos;t make you happier. It just increases your hangover the next day.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/spend-spend-spend-russia-sets-out-budget-plans-but-how-long-before-wartime-bubble-bursts/	2024-10-23T10:54:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157219700.jpg
Ukraine has stabilized situation in Toretsk, but Russia is concentrating troops in town's east, military says	Ukraine managed to stabilize the situation in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the Russian army continues to concentrate its forces in the eastern part of the town, Anastasiia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 23 on national television. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The situation in Toretsk has relatively stabilized. We (Ukrainian forces) are now holding the demarcation line unchanged. The enemy is still entrenched in the city&apos;s eastern parts,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, we are holding back their further advance and will defend the town as long as possible. And we are doing a good job of it now.&quot; The number of assaults on this front line&apos;s sector has slightly decreased, which may indicate that Russian troops have taken a tactical pause to possibly replenish manpower, accumulate weapons, and redeploy equipment, Bobovnikova added. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-stabilized-situation-in-toretsk-but-russia-is-concentrating-troops-in-towns-east-ukrainian-military-says/	2024-10-23T10:16:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg
About 3,000 North Korean troops were sent to Russia to participate in war against Ukraine, South Korean intelligence says	Nearly 3,000 soldiers had been sent to support the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine, and &quot;thousands more&quot;were expected to follow, Reuters reported on Oct. 23, citing South Korean intelligence. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has reported that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. &quot;Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October,&quot; Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said. &quot;It appears that the troops have now been dispersed to multiple training facilities in Russia and are adapting to the local environment.&quot; Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, according to South Korean military intelligence. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/about-3-000-north-korean-troops-were-sent-to-russia-to-participate-in-war-against-ukraine-south-korean-intelligence-says/	2024-10-23T09:36:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Ukraine's 'I Want to Live' project posts Korean-language video message, calls on North Korean soldiers to surrender	The Ukrainian project &quot;I Want to Live&quot; on Oct. 23 called on North Korean soldiers to surrender to Ukrainian forces in a new Korean-language video. Launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s Main Directorate of Intelligence, the 24-hour &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline helps Russian soldiers willingly surrender themselves or their units to the Ukrainian army. The Russian military is promised that after surrender, they will be held in compliance with the Geneva Conventions. &quot;You must not die senselessly in a foreign land. You must not repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!&quot; the Korean-language statement reads. &quot;No matter how many soldiers Pyongyang sends to help Russia, no matter the destination - Ukrainian POW camps are ready to receive soldiers of any nationality, religion, and ideological views.&quot; In the statement, the North Korean military is guaranteed safe conditions of detention, food, and medical care by the Ukrainian side. John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian efforts might help the North Koreans to desert. The North Korean soldiers will also know that the treatment by the Ukrainians will be &quot;much more humane &quot; than treatment by their own side and by the Russians, Foreman added. Foreman assumed that North Korea had probably anticipated this by holding the families of the soldiers, if not hostage, but setting out the consequences of desertion on their families. &quot;(North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un has absolutely no compunction in killing his own people, starving them, assassinating his political opponents, anybody he&#x2019;s seen as disloyal. So, I think that holding that sword of Damocles over the heads of the families of the soldiers of North Korea would be one way of keeping their loyalty,&quot; Foreman said. Russia and North Korea signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang in June. As part of the agreement, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. The secret clause reportedly allowed North Korea to send the first 1,000 of its soldiers to Ukraine to gain military experience. More North Korean troops are expected to be engaged, the source told the WSJ. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, previously revealed that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia and will be ready to fight by Nov. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-i-want-to-live-project-calls-on-north-korean-soldiers-to-surrender/	2024-10-23T08:46:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Ukraine denies Russia breached Chasiv Yar defense line following conflicting reports	Russian troops were not able to get a foothold in Ukrainian defense lines in the city of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Andrii Polukhin, a spokesperson of the 24th Mechanized Brigade, said in an interview with Free Radio on Oct. 22. Hours prior, Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th Mechanized Brigade&apos;s press service, said on national television that the Russian military managed to breach the defense, but there were no signs of the city&apos;s potential loss. Russian small infantry groups enter the Ukrainian defense line but cannot exit because they are being blocked by Ukrainian drones, according to Polukhin. &quot;It cannot be called a consolidation or wedging; it is not some kind of movement along the line of defense,&quot; Polukhin said. Petrychak, in turn, described the situation in this front-line sector as &quot;difficult but controlled.&quot; The situation remained tense throughout the last month, and the Russian military made daily attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian forces, according to Petrychak. He added that Russian troops used an advantage of heavy fog to cross the channel to Chasiv Yar, which is now blocked. The Russian army outnumbers the Ukrainian forces and is constantly trying to break through the Ukrainian defense line, shelling Chasiv Yar with artillery, launching missiles, and conducting bombardments with aircraft, according to Petrychak. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the Siverskyi Donets &#x2013; Donbas Canal as the new front line. Russian troops set their sights on Chasiv Yar, which is located on a higher ground, after capturing Avdiivka in February. The higher ground could give Russian troops a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to about 12,000 people. By April 2024, around 700 people remained. In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-denies-russia-getting-into-line-of-ukrainian-defense-in-chasiv-yar/	2024-10-23T07:53:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793922.jpg
Opinion: Putin’s drone strategy shows the cracks in Russia’s war machine	Russia shot down one of its own drones &#x2014; a large and stealthy S-70 &#x2014; after it flew uncontrolled into Ukrainian territory in early October, sparking speculation about how Moscow lost control of this valuable asset so publicly. It&#x2019;s an unforced error that will be keenly felt in Moscow, whose high ambitions for producing its own drones have been slow to take flight. Given shortfalls in manpower, munitions, artillery, and aircraft, Russia has signaled its belief that uncrewed systems could be transformative in an attritional war, listing drone production among the Kremlin&#x2019;s priority projects. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also announced plans to increase drone production tenfold in 2024, aiming to manufacture 1.4 million this year. But is this realistic or just more propaganda? Russia will struggle to meet this target and will likely have to rely on China to procure enough drones. To supply this demand, China would need to significantly boost its own production. After its invasion of Georgia in 2008, Russia ramped up investment in unmanned aerial vehicles. Yet drone production was not prioritized, and Russian firms fell short of international competitors like China, the U.S., Israel, and Turkey. The large combat models like the S-70 and smaller, more disposable reconnaissance drones that have been produced suffer from low manufacturing output, reflecting difficulties in moving from prototype to serial production &#x2014; a problem that plagues the Russian defense industry in general. Since the full-scale invasion, Russia has deployed low-cost Chinese quadcopters in vast numbers, while another Russian company, Albatross, has localized production of Iran&#x2019;s Shahed, a loitering munition or &quot;kamikaze&quot; drone. That Russia has leaned so heavily on Chinese and Iranian support highlights the difficulties the Kremlin has faced in meeting surging battlefield demand for new drones due to bottlenecks in domestic production. Despite a glut of new state funding for the military, Russia&#x2019;s defense industry remains hampered by systemic issues, such as poor productivity, low profitability, corruption, aging infrastructure, a shortage of workforce skills, and continued reliance on foreign parts and machine tools amid Western sanctions. Scaling up production and supply chains is not straightforward. Russia&#x2019;s defense industry has repeatedly adapted more quickly and effectively than outsiders expect, leveraging the country&#x2019;s vast reserves, high levels of state influence over strategic enterprises, and illicit networks. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) examines an Orlan-10 drone at the Special Technology Center in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Sept. 19, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)To meet Putin&#x2019;s ambitious goals, Russian defense managers will have to work along three lines: boosting manufacturing, accelerating the localization of foreign drone technology or paying others to build them, and importing as many drones as possible to fill the gap when domestic output falls short. Increasing productivity is a Kremlin priority but a difficult task. Firms face a tight labor market and must reorient supply chains toward Asia. Many critical technologies and machine tools are now harder to procure. Companies can buy parts from China and other trading partners or tap into a growing &quot;gray trade&quot; of components acquired through third countries. But this introduces quality control issues, especially since illicit supply chains often yield shoddy or counterfeit parts. These barriers make it clear Russia will not achieve its targets using domestic resources alone. Albatross provides a case study of localizing production, as it produces a version of the Shahed at the Alabuga site in Tatarstan with funding from VTB. This illustrates how drone production could be a lucrative opportunity for new companies in the market. In Russia, entrepreneurship is often encouraged during periods of state need, and partnerships with foreign suppliers offer a quick way to take proven designs and sell a locally produced version. Most importantly, to meet its targets, Russia will need to buy a lot of drones. Given Russia&#x2019;s growing dependence on China for parts and components, it seems unlikely the country will have the capacity to produce 1.4 million units domestically in the near future. Instead, Russia may become China&#x2019;s largest drone customer. According to RAND research, global production of drones was estimated at 2.4 million units in 2023, with China holding a 70% share (around 1.68 million units), and its company DJI plays a dominant role. Recent reports indicate that another Chinese company in Shenzhen is producing drones to order for Kupol, a major Russian defense firm. However, China would need to significantly increase production to meet existing demand from elsewhere, further pushing the Kremlin into strategic dependency on Beijing. Putin&#x2019;s formal announcement of a &quot;drone campaign&quot; is significant, but bold new political targets won&#x2019;t sweep aside complex industrial realities. The Kremlin will hope this unlocks financial resources and pressures defense managers to mobilize resources however they can. Still, it&#x2019;s unclear how Russia can achieve such a sharp increase in drone numbers without relying on continued off-the-shelf purchasing, especially from China. This campaign should serve as a signal to Kyiv and its partners that further investment in drone countermeasures is a priority, just as EU and NATO nations must continue to scale up their own drone production in support of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense.

North Korean troops dispatch was secret clause of Moscow-Pyongyang pact, WSJ reports	A strategic partnership agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang contained a secret clause on sending North Korean troops to fight Russia&apos;s full-scale war with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 23, citing an unnamed former Russian intelligence agent familiar with the matter. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang in June. As part of the agreement, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. The secret clause reportedly allowed North Korea to send the first 1,000 of its soldiers to Ukraine to gain military experience. More North Korean troops are expected to be engaged, the source told the WSJ. According to the newspaper, currently, most North Korean soldiers are kept at a safe distance from the front line in Ukraine. They are being shown how the Russian army handles logistics and are gaining a new understanding of drone warfare, the source said. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Earlier in October, Budanov said that the first group would consist of 2,600 soldiers. Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin confirmed on Oct. 23 that North Korean soldiers are in Russia without elaborating on their numbers and tasks. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-north-korea-troops-wsj/	2024-10-23T06:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine’s war is the reckoning with empire Europe can no longer avoid	Thirty years ago, in a Ukrainian churchyard where my Russian ancestors are buried, I knelt beside a very old woman leaning on a stick, her hair covered in a black kerchief. Behind us stood the Russian church that my great-grandfather built on his estate and where he lies buried. The old woman was the last villager left who could remember the time when our family lived there. She had been a young girl of six or seven, running up to the kitchen door of the big house, carrying blueberries in her apron, and receiving from my grandfather&#x2019;s sister a spoonful of hot blackberry jam. After that, the Bolshevik Revolution came, my family fled, the church was closed, and Soviet agents from the city eventually confiscated the grain, took away the kulaks, and left everyone to starve. The Holodomor, the famine that Stalin inflicted on Ukraine, reduced people who had farmed the richest soil in Europe to eating grass. Then came the war, when the Nazis set the village thatches alight and massacred the local Jewish population. The old woman sat next to me in the church and told me her story; at the end, she leaned her thin body against mine and began to howl. I have never forgotten the sound. Whenever I hear it again in memory, I understand what the Ukrainian struggle is about. The troops fighting to hold on in Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, the firemen pulling civilians out of the rubble of bombed buildings in Kharkiv, and the drone pilots targeting Russian ships in the Black Sea are fighting to give themselves and their children a different history than the one that made that old woman howl. This is what we don&#x2019;t seem to understand. The Western European and American public is increasingly disengaged from their struggle. The carnage seems unbelievable &#x2014; is it really possible that a half-million Russians and perhaps nearly as many Ukrainians have been killed or wounded since the full-scale war began in February 2022? For too many, the dying could just as well be happening on another planet, and our politicians&#x2019; insistence that our security depends on a Ukrainian victory sounds abstract, thin, and less than credible. If the Ukrainians are truly fighting for us, it is because they are fighting the last battle against European imperialism. Every other imperial power in Europe has given up its colonies and begun a reckoning with the harm that empire did to its colonial subjects and to its own people. For with empire came the invention of racial hierarchy and racially justified domination, violence, and cruelty. These poisons still affect us, and nostalgia for vanished imperial greatness has been just as damaging. Even in America, which had no empire, but an immensely profitable global hegemony, much of Donald Trump&#x2019;s presidential campaign stokes and exploits this atavistic sentiment, with its call to &#x201C;make America great again.&#x201D; You can&#x2019;t build democracy at home unless you dispense with empire and nostalgia for its loss. Until you do this, your politics will be consumed by deluded dreams. Spanish historians have told me that the final defeat of the Spanish empire with the loss of Cuba and the Philippines at the turn of the twentieth century fostered the authoritarian turn that delivered Spain to Franco and delayed the transition to democracy for two generations. Empire in Africa prevented a democratic transition in Portugal until 1974. Marine Le Pen&#x2019;s right-wing movement in France began with her father&#x2019;s fury at the loss of Algeria and his contempt for the democratic institutions Charles de Gaulle put in place after he withdrew France from North Africa. When societies face up to their past, they create the possibility of a politics based in reality, not fantasy. In Britain, the Labour government of 1945 understood that it could not build democracy at home unless it abandoned India and Palestine. Germany had to be unconditionally defeated before it gave up its fantasy of an imperium across Europe and Asia. Russia remains the one European society that has never honestly faced up to its imperial past. In refusing to acknowledge the legacy of Stalin, in failing to face up to his crimes in Ukraine, in the other &#x201C;captive nations,&#x201D; and in Russia itself, Russia closed off any path to its own democratic future. Its people have laid themselves open to the perpetual tyranny of a man who can only turn their sons into cannon fodder. This is the lethal pathology that Ukraine is fighting in our name. When Ukraine&#x2019;s citizens say they want to join Europe, what they mean is that they want to rip empire out of their souls and live as free people, liberated from a past whose memory made an old woman howl in pain. All imperial nostalgias are best laid to rest, even benign ones like hers and mine for the sweet days of the ancien r&#xE9;gime when my Russian ancestors kept the kitchen door open for peasant girls and gave them dollops of blackberry jam. A free Ukraine will have to make its own peace with the remnants of old Russia, like the churchyard where my ancestors are buried. For now, Ukrainians are pulling Tolstoy off their shelves, and toppling Catherine the Great from her plinth in Odesa. Later, a more complex reckoning will fall due. You have to own all of your history, not just the parts that fit your mythologies. Once Ukrainians have won a peace they can live with, a free Ukraine will have to own the imprint of the Russian past on its soul, and then wrestle free of that past. Only then can it begin to make a new history beyond terror, violence, and fear. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

3 companies of Russian soldiers killed, injured in assaults on Selydove, National Guard says	Ukraine&apos;s National Guard troops repelled 13 Russian attacks near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast over the past day, killing or injuring around three companies of soldiers, spokesperson Ruslan Muzychuk told Ukrainska Pravda on Oct. 23. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months. Russia is using significant infantry numbers near Selydove, according to the National Guard. A total of 307 Russian soldiers were killed or injured in the area over the past day, Muzychuk said. &quot;This is actually three companies,&quot; he added. The estimated advance of Russian forces near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 22, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian forces also reportedly destroyed more than 10 pieces of Russian equipment, including a tank and armored vehicles. &quot;In recent weeks, the enemy has significantly increased the presence of electronic warfare equipment, which complicates the work of aerial reconnaissance. &#xA0;But our UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators are finding solutions for the effective use of drones,&quot; Muzychuk said. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/around-3-companies-of-russian-soldiers-killed-injured-in-assaults-on-selydove-natinal-guard-says/	2024-10-23T05:43:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569108.jpg
Many Russians support Putin despite favoring opposing policies, survey shows	Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to enjoy majority support in his country, even though many of his supporters back steps contradicting the Kremlin&apos;s actual policies, a survey published by Meduza and RFE/RL&apos;s Current Time news outlets on Oct. 22 shows. The Kremlin&apos;s chief has enjoyed consistent support among the Russian population even as Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has been ongoing for more than two and half years, previous independent polling revealed. Around 78% of respondents said they continue to support Putin&apos;s activities as president, according to the poll conducted by the independent Levada Center between Sept. 10 and 17. At the same time, 83% of Putin&apos;s supporters said that the government should focus more on domestic social and economic issues, and 61% favored peace in Ukraine under mutual concessions. Some 43% of respondents wanted to restore relations with the West, while 25% supported full mobilization for the war against Ukraine. The Kremlin has avoided instituting a full draft, carrying out only a limited mobilization in September 2022 and replenishing its forces from other sources like volunteers, convicts, migrant workers, or, recently, North Korean soldiers. Of those who did not voice support for Putin, 79% supported a peace agreement with Ukraine with mutual concessions, 90% wanted to restore relations with the West, 92% desired greater government focus on domestic issues, and 13% supported mobilization. Putin has claimed he is always open to negotiations while simultaneously reiterating Moscow&apos;s maximalist goals of &quot;demilitarization&quot; and &quot;de-Nazification&quot; of Ukraine. The Kremlin&apos;s propaganda has falsely accused the Ukrainian leadership of Nazi ideology to justify its full-scale invasion. Ukrainian and Western officials said they do not believe Putin is willing to negotiate in good faith and continues to seek full control over the country. Russia has so far not agreed to participate in Ukraine&apos;s planned second peace summit. In June, Putin demanded Kyiv cede the entire regions of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Luhansk, and Donetsk, which are under partial Russian occupation, as a precondition for talks. Ukraine has rejected this and insisted any peace talks should be led on the basis of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula, which stresses the inviolability of territorial integrity and sovereignty and a complete withdrawal of Russian forces. Russia continues to hold roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are steadily pushing forward in the Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-support-despite-policies/	2024-10-23T05:21:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
France's first batch of Mirage 2000 jets to include 3 planes, media reports	France will deliver its first three Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025, the French newspaper La Tribune reported on Oct. 23, citing its sources. Paris previously confirmed it would begin transferring its aircraft in the first three months of the next year but did not comment on the numbers. The timing of delivery takes into account the time needed to train pilots and mechanics and prepare the aircraft, La Tribune wrote. According to the outlet, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry refused to comment for La Tribune. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. The Mirage 2000-5 is a fourth-generation fighter jet, meaning it is in the same class as the U.S.-made F-16 that Ukraine&apos;s Air Force already operates. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first countries to deliver their F-16s, making them the first Western fighter jets in Ukraine&apos;s arsenal. While Kyiv awaits Mirages and additional F-16s, it is also in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.	https://kyivindependent.com/mirage-2000-first-batch/	2024-10-23T04:37:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1231073461.jpg
North Korean troops are in Russia, US defense secretary confirms	There is evidence that North Korean troops are in Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Rome on Oct. 23, Reuters reported. Austin&apos;s comment comes as the first public confirmation by the U.S. of previous statements by Ukraine and South Korea. The two nations say Russia is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;There is evidence that there are DPRK (North Korean) troops in Russia. What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,&quot; the Pentagon chief said. Austin did not specify the number of North Korean troops that had arrived in Russia.

A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-arrive-in-russia-pentagon-chief-confirms/	2024-10-23T03:41:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Georgia denies journalist entry to cover elections amid rising Russian influence	Czech-British journalist Ray Baseley was denied entry to Georgia without an explanation after arriving at Tbilisi airport on Oct. 22 to cover the upcoming parliamentary elections. He is currently being held at the airport and should be deported in two days, his partner told the Kyiv Independent. As Georgians head to the polls on Oct. 26, thousands rallied in Tbilisi last weekend to demonstrate support for EU membership in the face of democratic backsliding and the Moscow-friendly direction of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Baseley, a freelancer from whom the Kyiv Independent agreed to commission stories covering the Georgian elections, wrote on X on Oct. 22 that he had been refused entry after arriving by plane without explanation. &quot;Today at 19:30 I was refused entry into the country of Georgia without reasoning or any further explanation, this is unacceptable, even the local border force doesn&#x2019;t know why I wasn&#x2019;t allowed entry,&quot; Baseley wrote. He posted a photo of the entry refusal form on social media. The document does not explain the reason, marking &quot;Other cases envisaged by Georgian legislation&quot; as grounds for the decision. Baseley holds Czech citizenship. Hello Georgians, Journalists and Czechs. Today at 19:30 I was refused entry into the country of Georgia without reasoning or any further explanation this is unacceptable even the local border force doesn&#x2019;t know why I wasn&#x2019;t allowed entry. Anyone who can help please write to me. pic.twitter.com/4HGh3xY9ma The journalist&apos;s partner, Ukrainian Maria Kaplina, told the Kyiv Independent later the same day that Georgian authorities had taken Baseley and that she had lost contact with him. Kaplina got in touch with him only the following day after Baseley was allowed to make a phone call. &quot;The current situation is that Ray is still in the Tbilisi airport. No one explained to him why they are keeping him there or why they are deporting him,&quot; Kaplina told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is a totally illegal action, and they&apos;re keeping him there for more than 17 hours. The (Czech) consul and a lawyer are working now to be able to enter the facility where they keep him. Authorities are preparing to deport him in two days.&quot; A Czech Foreign Ministry spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent that Prague is aware of the situation and has reached out to Georgian authorities regarding the case. &quot;Our consul is in contact with his (Baseley&apos;s) loved ones, and she has sent an official note to the Georgian Foreign Ministry, requesting information about his current location and the reason for his detention and denial of entry,&quot; spokesperson Daniel Drake said. Baseley is a Prague-based journalist who has also broadly covered Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine as a freelance reporter. Baseley previously reported on protests in Tbilisi that broke out in the spring over the adoption of a &quot;foreign agents&quot; law by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The legislation, which has been compared to a similar law in Russia, was aimed at NGOs and media organizations receiving funding from abroad. Its adoption was seen as a signal of the democratic backsliding and deteriorating media freedom under the Georgian Dream.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-denies-journalist-entry-to-cover-elections-amid-rising-russian-influence/	2024-10-23T03:33:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Ray.png
Ukraine receives $1.1 billion from IMF	Ukraine has received a tranche of nearly $1.1 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the successful completion of the fifth programme revision, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Oct. 23. &quot;The funds will be used to cover important non-military budget spending,&quot; Shmyhal said. Foreign aid is crucial for Ukraine as the economic pressure caused by the full-scale Russian invasion mounts. The besieged country received $42.5 billion in external financing last year, allowing it to function amid the ongoing war. The IMF has reached a preliminary agreement with Ukraine to provide Kyiv with another tranche in September. At the same time, the IMF said that the risks to Ukraine &quot;remain exceptionally high&quot; with the expected economic slowdown due to repeated Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure and the impact of the war on labor markets and confidence. The IMF said Kyiv needs to &quot;respect financing constraints and debt sustainability objectives&quot; in the 2025 budget. The EFF funds are meant to lend Ukraine stability amid the disruptions of war, support the country&apos;s postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Ukraine moves forward on the path to EU membership. The EFF is a long-term funding agreement that will allow Ukraine to access $15.6 billion in financial aid in regular installments.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-1-billion-from-imf/	2024-10-23T03:17:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
SBU says it foiled terror attack in Kyiv, detained suspects	Law enforcement officers detained two Ukrainians who were preparing a terror attack in the city of Kyiv and were coordinated by Russian intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed on Oct. 23. According to the statement, the suspects planned to detonate improvised explosives in a crowded place in Ukraine&apos;s capital to cause &quot;the maximum number of civilian deaths&quot; and sow panic. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have accused numerous citizens of spying or otherwise cooperating with Russian security services. Law enforcement officers detained two Ukrainians who were preparing a terror attack in the city of Kyiv and were coordinated by Russian intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine claimed on Oct. 23, 2024. (SBU/Telegram)Russian intelligence allegedly recruited a 20-year-old resident of the city of Zaporizhzhia via Telegram and instructed her on how to make explosives. She also engaged her 26-year-old partner to cooperate, the SBU said. The SBU claimed that the suspect was in contact with a Russian military intelligence officer from the Russian-occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. She used two cell phones to connect a detonator with plastic explosives, which she had to get from a hidden cache, according to the law enforcement agency. Before the planned terror attack, the two were supposed to fulfill a &quot;test task&quot; and set on fire several vehicles of the Ukrainian military in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

UK to allocate $155 million for naval coalition to protect Ukraine's ports	London will donate an additional 120 million pounds ($155 million) to the Maritime Capability Coalition to support Ukraine&apos;s Navy, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The move comes as a response to Russia stepping up attacks against port infrastructure in southern Odesa Oblast that resulted in damaged civilian ships and casualties. &quot;Russia&apos;s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The British government accused Russia of threatening global food security, including humanitarian supplies to war-stricken Palestine, just as some Global South leaders gather in the Russian city of Kazan for the BRICS summit. The U.K. is looking for partners to co-finance the supply of &quot;hundreds&quot; more naval drones as well as surveillance radars to protect Ukraine&apos;s grain corridor. London and Oslo are also seeking a further 100 million pounds ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more. As part of the naval coalition, Ukraine has received dozens of amphibious all-terrain vehicles and raiding boats, hundreds of anti-ship missiles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, according to the statement. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 attacks on Ukrainian ports, damaging or destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, said on Oct. 10 Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-naval-coalition/	2024-10-23T02:48:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-51838376.jpg
Zelensky preparing action plan for Ukraine to withstand war, source says	President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked the Ukrainian authorities to develop proposals for an internal action plan to help the country withstand the war, a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 23. According to the source, the document will address military, political, economic, and other areas, including certain decisions regarding law enforcement. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier in the day, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. &quot;The goal is to do everything possible to maintain unity and achieve results in various areas of the country&apos;s development,&quot; a source in Zelensky&apos;s team told BBC. The plan reportedly is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-preparing-ukraines-action-plan-to-withstand-war-source/	2024-10-23T01:37:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Russia helping North Korea with sanctions evasion, nuclear technology in return for soldiers, arms, Budanov says	Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities in return for North Korean troops and missiles, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told The Economist in comments published on Oct. 22. Budanov previously revealed that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia and will be ready to fight by Nov. 1. The move would signal deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, with North Korea already providing Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles for war against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s support in nuclear capabilities includes providing technologies for smaller tactical nuclear weapons and submarine missile-launch systems, Budanov claimed. The sanctions evasion can also be vital for North Korea, which faces heavy economic restrictions over its nuclear program. Russia has blocked the renewal of a U.N. monitoring program overseeing Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Speaking to The Economist, the Ukrainian spy chief said that the military personnel sent to Russia included 500 officers and three generals. A contingent of 2,600 troops should allegedly soon arrive in Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region partially held by Ukraine. North Korean troops are currently undergoing training in Khabarovsk Krai in Russia&apos;s far east, Budanov said. According to him, Pyongyang has also supplied Russia with 2.8 million artillery shells and an unspecified number of ballistic missiles, which are serviced by North Korean crews. Kyiv and Seoul have repeatedly sounded alarm on North Korea transferring personnel to Russia, though the reports have not been confirmed by the U.S. or other Western officials. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount pressure on North Korea, calling for a &quot;concrete response&quot; to the country&apos;s escalating military support of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, Zelensky said in his evening address, citing military intelligence reports. He also said that impoverished North Korea is likely receiving financial support for its military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-north-korea-nuclear/	2024-10-23T00:51:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175735683.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 14 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 14 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 23. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 of the 81 Shahed-type drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Fifteen drones were lost, and nine are still present in the Ukrainian airspace at the time of the publication. Russia also reportedly attacked Odesa with a Kh-31P missile. No damage or casualties were reported at the moment. Russia launched over 20 attacks against the Nikopol district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Oct. 22, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. One person was killed and another injured. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were killed and seven injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A strike against the village of Oleksandro-Kalynove killed two residents and injured two others. One person was killed in Riznykivka, three were injured in Myrnohrad, and one each in Pleshchiivka and Lyman, the governor said. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast killed one person and injured four, said the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Two women and one man were injured during an overnight attack against the village of Lisne, and a 65-year-old woman was wounded in the town of Kupiansk. A 54-year-old man was killed during a drone attack against the village of Kucherivka, the governor reported. Two people were injured during attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three multi-story buildings, 24 houses, and other buildings were damaged. Cherkasy, Kyiv, Luhansk, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-98/	2024-10-23T00:12:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Donetsk-Oct-23.jpg
UN secretary general visits Russia for BRICS summit despite Kyiv's criticism	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres arrived at the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan on Oct. 22, despite criticism from Ukraine, Voice of America reported. The BRICS group, a bloc of countries that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, is convening in Kazan for a three-day summit from Oct. 22-24. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders are participating in the conference. Guterres is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the event on Oct. 24, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.N. secretary general&apos;s visit. &quot;The U.N. secretary-general declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland. He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin,&quot; the ministry said on social media. &quot;This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the U.N.&apos;s reputation.&quot; Switzerland hosted Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit on June 15-16, with representatives of around 100 countries and organizations in attendance. Seventy-eight states and four organizations signed the final joint communique of the peace summit. Since then, multiple countries have signed on the ever-expanding list of delegations. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia for its full-scale war against Ukraine. The U.N. and Turkey also brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Kyiv to export its agricultural products. The agreement collapsed after Moscow had pulled out in 2023. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, also arrived at the summit. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled the trip after suffering a head injury at home. At the meeting, Russia will seek to convince the BRICS countries to create an alternative platform for international payments that would be immune to Western sanctions, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/guterres-brics-russia/	2024-10-23T00:00:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173387817.jpg
US to continue to 'tighten the screws' on Russian LNG exports, senior official says	The U.S. will continue to &quot;tighten the screws&quot; on the export of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) to deprive Moscow of energy revenues, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 22, citing Jeffrey Pyatt, the assistant secretary of state for energy resources. Washington slapped sanctions against Arctic LNG 2 in 2023 and started imposing restrictions on ships that began taking LNG from the plant this August. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, aims to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. Washington has not imposed sanctions on other Russian LNG plants, including Yamal and Portovaya, which continue to supply liquefied natural gas to Europe and Asia. If sanctioned, this can likely lead to a reduction in global LNG supplies and higher prices, Bloomberg reported. According to Pyatt, the U.S. aims to reduce the revenues Russia receives from its oil and gas resources. He said that such a &quot;policy is working,&quot; and the U.S. is closely monitoring where the sanctioned Russian cargoes are heading. &quot;You can be assured that the Biden administration is going to continue to tighten the screws against Russia&#x2019;s LNG exports,&quot; the senior official added. The Financial Times reported in July that Russia is likely expanding its &quot;ghost fleet&quot; of tankers, created primarily to avoid Western oil sanctions, to LNG exports as well.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-continue-to-tighten-the-screws-on-russian-lng-exports/	2024-10-22T23:01:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134522.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 683,040 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 683,040 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 23. This number includes 1,460 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,088 tanks, 18,229 armored fighting vehicles, 27,217 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,674 artillery systems, 1,234 multiple launch rocket systems, 981 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,489 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-683-040-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-22T22:17:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174645997.jpg
Russia-linked disinformation campaign spreads false claims about Tim Walz, US intelligence officials say	Russian disinformation groups have been linked to viral attacks targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, U.S. intelligence sources said on Oct. 22. Walz has served as governor of Minnesota since 2019 after spending 12 years in Congress. He is an army veteran, having enlisted in the National Guard as a teenager and serving for another 24 years. Walz was also a high school teacher before entering politics. The false content that was spread, which includes baseless claims about Walz&#x2019;s past as a teacher, was found to have several signs of manipulation. Analysts connected the disinformation to Russian operations aimed at undermining the Democratic ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Private researchers had already flagged these videos as fake, with one particularly false claim involving a man impersonating a former student of Walz&apos;s to accuse him of misconduct. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Walz has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, signing legislation barring state agencies from doing business with Russian and Belarusian companies. His state, Minnesota, is also home to weapons manufacturers that supply arms critical for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Walz previously met President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2023 in a conversation organized by the National Governors Association. &quot;It was an honor to hear from President Zelensky firsthand and offer him our unwavering support,&quot; Walz said at the time. &quot;Minnesota is a proud home to many Ukrainian families, and we will continue to welcome and support Ukrainian refugees in our state.&quot; U.S. intelligence officials report that Russia continues to actively run influence campaigns aimed at boosting former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump. According to the U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, Russia&#x2019;s meddling in the U.S. presidential elections is &#x201C;more sophisticated&#x201D; than before. Kirby claims that Russia is using artificial intelligence and funding companies in the U.S., including Tennessee-based far-right propaganda outlet, Tenet Media. &#x201C;It&apos;s not just about Russian bots, trolls, and fake personas in social networks, although that&apos;s part of it too, but they&apos;ve become much more sophisticated,&quot; Kirby said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-linked-disinformation-campaign-spreads-false-claims-about-tim-walz-us-intelligence-officials-say/	2024-10-22T21:37:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164176277.jpg
Turkey quietly curbs military goods exports to Russia following US warning, FT reports	Turkey has quietly blocked the export of U.S.-origin military goods to Russia following a warning from Washington, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 22. In recent weeks, Ankara updated its customs systems to stop the export of over 40 categories of U.S.-made items deemed critical to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, according to FT sources. The new restrictions target goods such as microchips, processors, and control systems, believed to be used in weapons. According to the report, Turkish banks have also reduced dealings with Russian entities over the past year, following U.S. threats of sanctions. The updated policy regarding Russian exports was not publicly announced due to political sensitivities. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions. In 2023, Turkey became the world&#x2019;s biggest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, importing around 42.2 billion euros ($45.9 billion) in oil, natural gas, and coal from the country &#x2013; a fivefold increase over the past decade. At the same time, Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty, and his administration has given significant aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;We support Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, together with Ukrainian Crimea,&quot; Erdogan said on Feb. 3. Turkey also brokered a grain deal in 2022, along with the UN, that was essential in mitigating a global surge in food prices partially caused by the war. It allowed Ukraine to export its agricultural products via the Black Sea, despite the ongoing invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-quietly-curbs-military-goods-exports-to-russia-following-us-warning-ft-reports/	2024-10-22T19:21:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
Poland shuts down Russian Consulate in Poznan amid claims of sabotage	Poland is closing down the Russian Consulate in Poznan due to alleged sabotage attempts from Russia, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Oct. 22. A number of suspected spy networks, allegedly run by Minsk and Moscow, have been uncovered in Poland over the past years. Warsaw has positioned itself as one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, leading to a sharp deterioration of ties with Russia and Belarus. &quot;Russia is waging a hybrid war,&quot; Sikorski said in a post on X. &quot;It is attempting sabotage on Polish territory. ... (I)t is my duty to react decisively. The first step is to close the Russian Consulate in Poznan.&quot; Moscow intends to retaliate against the decision, according to Russian state media. An infiltration attempt involving recruitment efforts by the Russian mercenary group Wagner was recently uncovered in Krakow, Poland. Last week, the Krakow District Court began the trial of two Russian nationals, Andrei G. and Aleksei T., who the Wagner Group allegedly hired to distribute flyers in Krakow, encouraging people to join the organization. They face charges related to foreign intelligence activities and involvement with an international armed group intending to commit acts of terrorism. Aside from Poland, they supposedly also worked in other European cities, including Berlin and Paris, hanging flyers and distributing stickers with QR codes for enlistment. Russia is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague on Oct. 9. According to Lipavsky, Europe must gear up its vigilance to counter such threats. &quot;We need much more determination in the fight against Kremlin influence than we have shown so far. The solution lies in strategic communication, sanctions, exposing crimes, and utilizing existing legal measures,&quot; Lipavsky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-shuts-down-russian-consulate-in-poznan-amid-claims-of-sabotage/	2024-10-22T18:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158687722.jpg
Ukraine's population dropped by 10 million after Russia's 2014 invasion, UN says	Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia invaded in 2014, according to Florence Bauer, regional director for the Eastern European and Central Asian branch of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA). Russian troops first invaded Ukraine in 2014, occupying parts of the eastern Donbas region and illegally annexing the Crimean peninsula. Since then, Ukraine&apos;s population has fallen by over 10 million and the number of refugees has surged to 6.7 million, with the full-scale invasion of 2022 exacerbating an already dire decline. &quot;The birth rate plummeted and is currently at around one child per woman, which is one of the lowest in the world,&quot; &#xA0;Bauer said on Oct. 22 at a briefing in Geneva. Ukraine&apos;s birth rate is now the lowest in Europe, according to the U.N. Refugees account for a major portion of Ukraine&apos;s population loss, with casualties of Russia&apos;s war another contributing &#xA0;factor. &#xA0; &quot;It&apos;s difficult to have exact numbers, but estimates range around tens of thousands of casualties,&quot; Bauer said. The population of Ukraine totaled 37.441 million as of Jan. 1, 2024, but more declines are expected in the coming years. A U.N. forecast in July predicted that the population might drop to as low as 15.3 million people by 2100. Ukraine and the UNFPA have partnered in developing a national demographic strategy, Bauer said. The strategy focuses on human capital rather than simply trying to increase the birth rate. The path to population stability also depends on an end to the war, Bauer acknowledged. Russia is facing its own demographic crisis, with a projected decline of about 7 million over the next two decades.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-population-dropped-by-10-million-after-russias-2014-invasion-un-says/	2024-10-22T16:04:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179816217.jpg
Zelensky urges allies to increase pressure on North Korea	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 22 urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount pressure on North Korea, calling for a &quot;concrete response&quot; to the country&apos;s escalating military support of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, Zelensky said in his evening address, citing military intelligence reports. &quot;But we know how to respond to this challenge,&quot; he said. &quot;And it is important that our partners do not shy away from this challenge as well. All partners.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has reported that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on Oct. 22 that North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23 to support the Russian military against Ukraine&apos;s incursion in the region. &quot;If North Korea can intervene in the war in Europe, then the pressure on this regime is definitely not strong enough,&quot; Zelensky said. The involvement of North Korean troops would mark a &quot;significant escalation&quot; in Russia&apos;s war, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 21, without directly confirming the reports. The U.S. has also said it is &quot;concerned&quot; by reports of North Korea&apos;s increased participation, with a White House spokesperson saying such a move would indicate &quot;a new level of desperation&quot; on Moscow&apos;s part. The South Korean government has expressed alarm, and is reportedly considering dispatching a monitoring team to Ukraine. North Korea&apos;s direct involvement may also prompt Seoul to revisit its stance on supplying weapons to Kyiv. Zelensky in his address called on international partners to &quot;stop Russia and its allies&quot; from expanding the scope of the war. &quot;Aggressors must be stopped. We expect a firm, concrete response from the world. Hopefully, not only in words.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-urges-allies-to-increase-pressure-on-north-korea/	2024-10-22T14:22:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-1.png
North Korean troops to arrive in Kursk tomorrow, military intelligence says	North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23 to support the Russian military against Ukraine&apos;s incursion in the region, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), told the War Zone on Oct. 22. &#xA0; &quot;We are waiting for the first units tomorrow in the Kursk direction,&quot; Budanov said, though he did not specify how many would be deployed. &quot;We will see after a couple of days.&quot; Budanov&apos;s statement follows reports that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea has denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; Despite the denials, reports of increased military involvement continue to mount. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. A government source in Seoul also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 22 that two North Korean military units of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training for the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-to-arrive-in-kursk-tomorrow-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-22T13:09:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040844-2.jpg
Putin, Xi discuss war in Ukraine at BRICS summit in Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed Ukraine during their meeting on Oct. 22 at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia. The BRICS alliance, a bloc of countries that now includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, is convening in Kazan for a three-day summit from Oct. 22-24. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders are participating in the conference. Putin and Xi reportedly spoke for about an hour, according to Russian state media. The leaders discussed Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the BRICS agenda, and bilateral relations. &quot;The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined,&quot; Xi said. Xi and Putin during their meeting &quot;outlined the main parameters of further contacts to continue the dialogue,&quot; according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia hopes to increase cooperation with China on &quot;all international platforms,&quot; Putin said. Xi and Putin concurred that the bilateral relations were at a historical highpoint, and jointly protect &quot;regional tranquility and stability.&quot; Although China officially maintains a neutral stance on Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine and denies providing lethal aid, Beijing and Moscow continue to strengthen their economic and political ties. At a previous meeting in Kazakhstan in July, Xi and Putin concurred that the bilateral relations were at a historic high point. Chinese companies have been sanctioned by the U.S. for producing drones used in Russia&apos;s war. Various countries have accused China of aiding Russia by providing machine tools, weapons technology, satellite imagery, semiconductors, and other dual-use technologies. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that intelligence data indicates that &quot;China is actively helping Russia drag out this war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-xi-discuss-war-in-ukraine-at-brics-summit-in-russia/	2024-10-22T12:53:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179438248.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US to provide Ukraine with $800 million to boost domestic long-range capabilities	Key developments on Oct. 22: The U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic development of long-range capabilities, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. On the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a new $400 million military aid package during a surprise visit to Kyiv. In addition, Zelensky also said that Washington is preparing to provide $800 million for the production of Ukrainian drones. &quot;Then there should be also the next tranche in the amount of $700-800 million,&quot; Zelensky said at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, in reference to the package designated for long-range capabilities. Zelensky and Austin also discussed how much of the $8 billion in aid the U.S. announced in late September could be dedicated to Ukrainian production by the end of this year. Domestically produced long-range weapons are key to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine had invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes. Ukrainian drones attacked four plants in Tula, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts in Russia overnight on Oct. 22, Russian local authorities claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses destroyed 11 drones over Bryansk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, two over Kursk Oblast, one over Tula Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast. In Tambov Oblast, a Ukrainian drone reportedly set to fire the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo, according to Governor Maxim Egorov. According to the Biokhim website, it produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol, a solvent which is used in the manufacture of a wide range of products including explosives. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast overnight, Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed a drone attack caused a minor fire on one of the floors of an industrial enterprise. No casualties have reported. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. North Korea has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine, Newsweek reported on Oct. 22, citing South Korean television network TV Chosun. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; The report said that this move could mean further training of pilots on Russian combat aircraft. If the report is confirmed, Russia will become the first country where North Korean pilots will be stationed outside their country since the Vietnam War. They also previously participated in combat operations in Syria and Egypt during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had already been sent to Russia. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they would be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia has also surfaced online. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has also been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. South Korea is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops that Russia may involve in its full-scale war, Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22, citing an unnamed government source. &quot;There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&quot; the source said. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. If deployed, a South Korean team may include military personnel from intelligence units who will be able to analyze Pyongyang&apos;s warfare tactics or participate in the interrogations of captured North Koreans. The government is also reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. The source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly. While the U.S. has been cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. The Group of Seven (G7) plans to keep Russian assets frozen even after the end of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Japanese news agency Nikkei reported on Oct. 22, citing its undisclosed sources from G7. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion in Russian sovereign assetsimmobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the European Union has devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. G7 leaders will issue a joint statement in October saying that &quot;Russia&apos;s sovereign assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,&quot; according to the draft prepared by this year&apos;s chair, Italy. The bloc will also guarantee a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, Nikkei reported, citing the draft. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed a deal to provide Ukraine with the $50 billion loan by the end of the year. The loan will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) as part of that pledge. In October, the World Bank&apos;s executive committee approved the creation of a new fund to help fulfill G7&apos;s $50 billion loan. Estimates of the damage that Russia&apos;s aggression has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure over the past decade vary. The World Bank said in February that it could be as high as $486 billion. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the loan. EU officials have said that the loan would be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-39/	2024-10-22T12:21:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1980079331.jpg
Zelensky denies potential dismissal of defense minister, head of military intelligence	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 21 denied rumors regarding the possible resignation of military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to do that. I was not going to replace Budanov. This information was circulating, yes. There was no such question about Umerov either,&quot; Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. Zelensky&apos;s statement followed media speculation that Budanov was in line for dismissal. Budanov, 38, has been the head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence since August 2020. In late September, Umerov dismissed two of Budanov&apos;s deputies, Viktor Zaitsev and Ihor Ostapenko. The decision was not made in cooperation with Budanov, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. Consequently, reports about Budanov&apos;s possible dismissal began circulating in the Ukrainian media. Servant of the People lawmaker Yurii Mysiagin, who is deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, said via his Telegram channel on Oct. 2 that the question of replacing Budanov was &quot;not considered.&quot; Zelensky carried out a major government reshuffle in September, saying that there was a &quot;need for new energy.&quot; During the staff rotations, the Cabinet of Ministers and the list of deputy heads of the Presidential Office were partially updated.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-denies-potential-dismissal-of-defense-minister-head-of-military-intelligence/	2024-10-22T12:11:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1733350996.jpg
Not waiting until the war is over'– Foreign investment keeps growing in Ukraine	Ukraine is still far from an investor&apos;s paradise, but increasingly valuable business deals are being signed in the war-torn country this year. &#xA0;In the first nine months of 2024, there were 36 Ukrainian mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) with a total estimated value of $643 million, according to a new report from KPMG Ukraine, an accounting organization based in Kyiv. The average value of M&amp;As was $38 million.For comparison, there were 37 deals worth $625 million in the same period last year with an average value of $27 million.The start of the full-scale invasion painted a bleak scene for Ukraine&#x2019;s M&amp;As with only 28 deals amounting to $494 million in 2022, the lowest level in a decade. But Ukraine&#x2019;s business activity is slowly rising from the ashes, bolstered by inflation control and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2023, and topped off with resilient companies. Ukrainian M&amp;A deal activity. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Foreign investors eye up opportunities Despite Ukraine&#x2019;s struggles on the battlefield this year and Russian attacks wiping out a chunk of its energy infrastructure, foreign investment has perked up this year. There were 10 inbound deals worth an estimated $473 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 13 deals in 2023 bringing in $278 million.The majority of inbound deals came from North America and Europe, with three transactions totaling $255 million and five transactions accounting for $159 million, respectively. Those that are coming in are willing to take the high risks for the high reward, but are investing in companies that operate successfully and staying away from distressed assets, Dmytro Boroday, a partner at private equity firm Horizon Capital, told the Kyiv Independent. Sectors like metal and mining, that have been hard hit by the invasion, have seen no M&amp;A activity since the start of the full-scale invasion. Many of the assets have been targeted by Russia and are located close to frontline regions. Ukrainian M&amp;A deals by sector. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)This year has also seen an inbound deal from beyond Ukraine&#x2019;s European and American allies after the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) acquired a 12.6% stake for $54 million in Ukrainian agri-tech company MHP SE, a leading exporter of vegetable oils.Like most of the foreign investors, SALIC was already present in Ukraine. While more foreign companies are showing interest in Ukraine, when it comes to the crunch, it is still rare for new investors to come in. One exception was the purchase of Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell and service provider Datagroup-Volia by French billionaire Xavier Niel&#x2019;s company NJJ Capital, who merged the two companies under a new entity Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell. The total value of the deal was over $600 million. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation on Oct. 10 announced they would provide $435 million to finance the merged company. &#x201C;It is the largest M&amp;A deal over the last decade,&#x201D; said Boroday, adding that including all capital expenditures the deal will amount to $1.5 billion. &#x201C;We would like to see more deals of this magnitude and scale. Hopefully, this would signal to other investors in the market that the time to invest and do major deals is not waiting until the war is over but deploying (capital) now,&#x201D; he added. Lifecell signboard is visible on the facade of the building in Lviv, Ukraine on Dec. 15, 2023. (Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Ukrainian innovation and technology companies attracted the most funding from foreign investors with six deals totaling $290 million. The average value was $48 million, with IT unicorn Creatio&#x2019;s $200 million funding round bringing in the most of all M&amp;As in the first nine months of the year. &#x201C;This confirms market faith in the stability of Ukraine&#x2019;s IT sector which has been able to demonstrate resilience with minimal disruptions even during wartime, owing to this sector&#x2019;s potential for remote work and thus the ability to maintain operations even with a decentralized workforce,&#x201D; KPMG said. Ukrainian companies are also increasingly investing money abroad, which KPMG believes could continue in the future. Outbound activity has risen to an all-time high since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with 10 deals totaling $55 million as Ukrainians seek to diversify and pursue opportunities internationally. Outbound M&amp;As extend yonder the EU&#x2019;s borders, with Ukrainian IT firm Intellias acquiring UK-based IT consultancy NorthLink Digital in August and U.S.-based digital health company C2 Solutions in April. Ukraine&#x2019;s private energy giant DTEK, owned by the country&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, conducted the largest disclosed outbound deal valued at $32.4 million with Polish renewable energy company Columbus Energy. The company, which has suffered heavily from Russia&#x2019;s attacks on energy infrastructure, announced it had acquired a 133-megawatt battery storage project in March after an agreement with Columbus. It&#x2019;s DTEK&#x2019;s breakthrough deal into the Polish renewables market as the company looks towards a green future in line with the EU. &#xA0; A worker outside a thermal power plant, extensively damaged after a Russian missile attack, at an undisclosed location, in Ukraine, on April 12, 2024. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Domestic investmentsAt home, domestic deals made up 44% of the overall volume of M&amp;As but only contributed 18% of the deal volume. KPMG believes this could be down to the lack of transparency of domestic transactions, with only 25% of deal values disclosed. A clearer picture is expected at the end of the year. The largest disclosed sale was the privatization of Kyiv&#x2019;s Hotel Ukraina, which was sold to Ola Fine LLC owned by e-sports tycoon and Stalker game series owner Maxim Krippa for $59.5 million.Since the full war, Ukraine has amped up its privatization efforts to raise money for the state budget, with Krippa&#x2019;s purchase the largest privatization case during the first nine months of the year. This was surpassed in October by the sale of the state-owned UMCC-Titanium, one of the world&#x2019;s largest titanium producers, to Cemin Ukraine for $96 million. Agriculture has also seen significant attention from private Ukrainian companies. The biggest deal saw MHP SE acquire a 100% stake in Ukrainian Meat Farm LLC for $15.1 million. More deals are expected on the horizon following Ukraine&#x2019;s land-market reforms at the start of the year which &#x201C;continues to unlock private investment potential in Ukrainian agriculture,&#x201D; KPMG said.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-waiting-until-the-war-is-over-foreign-investment-keeps-growing-in-ukraine/	2024-10-22T11:18:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/463465872_27237238975923867_5734064406440266094_n.jpg
Zelensky signs decree to liquidate medical examination commissions amid corruption scandal	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 22 issued a decree to liquidate medical examination commissions for determining the severity of disabilities by Dec. 31. The decree was released after a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), which on Oct. 22 discussed violations at medical examination commissions and the fraudulent acquisition of disability status by officials through corruption schemes. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows evading military service and receiving a higher pension, among other social benefits. According to the decree, working groups will be set up to verify certificates of disability issued by medical examination commissions within three months. If any violations are found, the certificates must be annulled. Starting from Oct. 22, pension payments for officials with disabilities should be inspected within one week. In a month, a new bill will be drafted to change the system of calculating pension payments to officials, the decree read. A plan to digitalize all stages of the medical examination commission should also be developed within two weeks. Meanwhile, the procedure for former officials with disabilities crossing the state border will be reviewed within a month. Following the NSDC meeting, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. Corruption schemes at medical examination commissions linked to draft evasion have been reported in Rivne, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kharkiv oblasts. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/medical-examination-commissions-for-determining-severity-of-disability-to-be-eliminated-at-end-of-2024/	2024-10-22T10:54:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2d5925e5-8c30-4c7a-be1b-26e21cd3fe9f.jpeg
North Korea has sent pilots to Russia to join its war in Ukraine, Newsweek reports	North Korea has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine, Newsweek reported on Oct. 22, citing South Korean television network TV Chosun. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; A government official in South Korea claimed that North Korea had sent fighter pilots to Vladivostok, a city in Russia&apos;s Far East, ahead of the first deployment of its ground troops on Oct. 8, according to TV Chosun. The report said that this move could mean further training of pilots on Russian combat aircraft.

MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 78	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 78 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 14- Oct. 20, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The president signed the draft law on customs reform. On Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed draft law #6490-d on the full restart of the State Customs Service. Key provisions of the draft law, in particular those regarding new procedures to select the service&apos;s head, will come into force from Oct. 31. The draft law on tax increase hasn&#x2019;t been signed yet. On Oct. 15, the speaker of the parliament signed draft law #11416-d on tax increase and sent it to the President&apos;s Office for signing. The draft law was considered as urgent by the office. However, the President still hasn&#x2019;t signed it yet. As we reported in Issue 77, one key amendment which included all major suggestions from the Tax Committee was rejected during the voting, in particular, the norm which enables the draft law to come into force retrospectively from Oct. 1. For example, it seems that the increase of military levy will be applied only after the draft law is signed and published, which will decrease expected revenues from its adoption. Next week parliament will consider the draft law on the accounting chamber reform. Next meetings of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine are scheduled for the week starting Oct. 28. Among the issues in the agenda the parliament will consider are the 2025 State Budget and draft law #10044-d on the restart of the accounting chamber of Ukraine. The competition for new members of the Bureau of Economic Security Civil Oversight Council has begun. To participate in the competition to the new bureau&apos;s Civil Oversight Council, CSOs had to nominate their candidates and submit their documents from Oct. 14-18. New members will be selected by online voting which will take place from Oct. 24&#x2013;Oct. 27. The results have to be announced and published on the bureau&apos;s official website on Oct. 28. The president signed three draft laws from the World Bank requirements. On Oxt. 17, the president signed among others draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies, draft law #11474 on privatization of the state banks via Prozorro.Sale platform, and draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register (the latter is also an obligation under the Ukraine Facility). All three were required by the World Bank for receiving further financial support. The Committee on Economic Development is finalizing the new draft law on public procurements. On Monday, the Committee on Economic Development has to finalize the text of draft law #11520 on public procurements for the second and final reading. The committee must send the draft law for the revision of the European Commission immediately.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-78/	2024-10-22T08:01:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-Oct-16.jpeg
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Kostin resigns	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 amid reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status. Kostin&apos;s resignation comes after a National Security and Defense Council meeting headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the meeting, the &quot;immoral situation&quot; with the fake disabilities of prosecutors was discussed, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. &quot;I am grateful to the president of Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s Verkhovna Rada for their trust. But in this situation, I believe it is right for me to resign from the post of prosecutor general,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-prosecutor-general-kostin-resigns/	2024-10-22T07:34:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
Torn apart by infighting, without a plan, what comes next for Russia’s opposition?	When Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024, the country&#x2019;s liberal dissidents vowed to carry on their mission: to end the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Eight months on, however, and Russia&#x2019;s opposition is bitterly divided, with little to no vision of how to carry on the promised fight. Their grievances resonate far beyond the negotiating table. In September, the Navalny-linked Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) accused fellow dissident Leonid Nevzlin of orchestrating a violent hammer attack on its former CEO, Leonid Volkov, on the streets of Vilnius. Nevzlin denies the claims. The accusations tore through the already tattered relationship between the FBK and the opposition circles to which Nevzlin belongs, headed by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky &#x2013; so much so that Khodorkovsky accused Navalny&#x2019;s allies of &#x201C;waging a campaign&#x201D; to discredit him. The FBK, meanwhile, faces allegations of its own. Opposition activist Maxim Kats released a two-hour video on Oct. 1 accusing the group of rehabilitating the reputations of two Russian businessmen accused of fraud by accepting their donations. The FBK is yet to comment on the investigation in-depth, saying it will instead release a more detailed response after its own analysis of Kats&#x2019; documents. &#x201C;We will have to do this at the expense of our real work,&#x201D; FBK chairwoman Maria Pevchikh complained on X. &#x201C;Time that should be spent on matters that are actually important will have to be spent on this.&#x201D; Both episodes capture a snapshot of the issues that face Russia&#x2019;s opposition: open suspicion or outright hostility between rival groups, and a lack of agreement on what the movement&#x2019;s key goals should be. But with no solution on the horizon - and Moscow&#x2019;s war machine continually on the march &#x2013; what comes next for Russia&#x2019;s opposition in exile? Infighting is nothing new for Russia&#x2019;s liberal opposition. Many of the most divisive splits are generational: politicians who were active in the 1990s, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Garry Kasparov, find themselves adrift from younger activists, such as the leaders of the FBK. There are key differences in political vision and policies. &#x201C;What I think Khodorkovsky and others want (for Russia) is a far slower, gradual change,&#x201D; says Stephen Hall, assistant professor in Russian and Post-Soviet Politics at the University of Bath. It&#x2019;s harder to get a clear image of the FBK&#x2019;s plans for the Russia of the future: the group has not released a detailed roadmap, despite making an effort to sound willing to embrace a more drastic shift.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;With the FBK, there is this idea of talking about corruption so that there will be mass protests, and that these will radically change Russia,&#x201D; Hall says. This tactic led the organization into exile with little success in stirring dissent at home. Such differences can very quickly become deeply personal in Russian political circles. Since the 1990s, oppositionists have rightfully feared infiltration by the security services, creating an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion rather than good faith. It is an atmosphere that government agents have only sought to intensify. In August, a suspected Russian agent, Pablo Gonz&#xE1;lez, was returned to Russia following a major prisoner exchange. Gonz&#xE1;lez, whose actual name was Pavel Rubtsov, has successfully infiltrated the Russian opposition, building both friendships and romantic relationships with members of the group. Russian democracy also remains centered on people, rather than institutions, groups, or parties. Disagreements can be viewed as personal attacks rather than political or social discourse. &#x201C;Ultimately, it&#x2019;s the product of the weaknesses within Russian democracy itself, in as much as you have people who can&apos;t build institutions. Things become very personalized around key figures who are vying for these little shards of daylight in a very dark forest,&#x201D; says Luke March, professor in Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics at the University of Edinburgh. &#x201C;You still have this revolutionary culture of strong leaders with their small organizations.&#x201D; Even after his demise, Navalny remains at the epicenter of the news:a flare of books and literature have already been in the works following his life and death. Navalny&#x2019;s posthumous memoir, Patriot, was published on Oct. 22, with excerpts from the book shared with a number of media outlets from the U.S. and Europe.

(Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)Yet among those alive, no one has seemed capable or willing to pick up Navalny&#x2019;s torch. &quot;The death of Navalny left a chasm within the Russian opposition because there is no one with the same gravitas. Khodorkovsky is a former oligarch: there were some very dark parts in his history. Gary Kasparov is a very intelligent man, but not very good at election,&quot; says Hall. &quot;Even within the FBK, Leonid Volkov and Maria Pevchikh seem to lead in a kind of duopoly, but there isn&apos;t one that stands out.&quot; As democracy and civil society have disintegrated further in Russia, and small organizations have already dwindled, this problem of over-personalization has only become more acute. &#x201C;Organizations that aren&apos;t running for the electorate are insulated from the pragmatism that they need,&#x201D; says March. &#x201C;They focus very much on that (ideological) purity: it feeds a more conspiratorial mindset.&#x201D; Some had hoped that the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine would compel rival groups to work together. Yet, as the stakes have become higher, divides have become more ingrained. As Western organizations choose to dedicate greater support to Ukrainian causes, some Russian groups have seen a drop in resources &#x2013; an immediate source of tension between those competing for funding. The war has also highlighted issues that the Russian opposition has long considered particularly sensitive or divisive: namely, Russia&#x2019;s imperial legacy, still ingrained in the mindset of many of the country&#x2019;s leading liberal lights. &#x201C;Ukraine is one of the biggest issues that divides the Russian opposition because, while formally speaking they&apos;re all anti-war, will that involve a bigger critique of what Russia has been doing (in colonizing neighboring countries) for decades?&#x201D; says March. &#xA0;&#x201C;Russian colonialism is one of the thorniest issues for the opposition. But arguably they can&#x2019;t just park that in the current environment.&#x201D; Navalny&#x2019;s FBK and his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, have been repeatedly criticized for their dismissive take on decolonization; Navalny himself triggered controversy by saying that Crimea &quot;is not a sausage sandwich that can be returned to someone.&quot; Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian journalist freed as part of the exchange that saw Gonz&#xE1;lez go the other way, took to the stage a few days after his release and called for the decrease of sanctions on his country, calling them &#x201C;extremely unfair.&#x201D; &quot;Navalny had his own history of Russian imperialism, and that&apos;s if we&apos;re being nice about it, &quot; says Hall. &#x201C;Like many Russian liberals, when it comes to Ukraine, they aren&apos;t liberal any longer.&quot; It is difficult for politicians in exile to remain relevant in their home countries. Disunity and division have only added to the obstacles faced by Russia&#x2019;s opposition, robbing them of coherency, clarity, and charisma. They have been unable to act as a real political force in Russia &#x2013; something that, for now, seems unlikely to change. Yet there are other paths open to opposition groups that wish to weaken the Putin regime, either individually or as a collective. Most immediate are the challenges of supporting those Russians who have either fled abroad to escape persecution or to avoid mobilization. This growing diaspora will need organizations to work with governments to iron out issues such as visas, work, access to banking, and wider integration. Opposition groups abroad already work in these areas, notably the Anti-War Committee of Russia and its Ark project. These pragmatic, &#x201C;bread and butter issues&#x201D; are also an easy starting point for organizations that may have a fraught relationship to start working together more closely, says March. There is also the task of breaking the Kremlin&#x2019;s media monopoly: a skill at which groups such as the FBK and their tongue-in-cheek, YouTube-friendly style, have already proven themselves particularly adept. &#x201C;Navalny spoke a different language that was much less focused on the abstract of Putin&apos;s evil but on the things that were interesting to Russians in terms of grassroots corruption. Where has this palace come from? Where is your money going?&#x201D; says March. &#x201C;It was less focused on high principles and more on the pragmatism of how you actually gain support and highlight the problems in Russian society.&#x201D; There are also more challenging tasks, such as forging a vision of Russia&#x2019;s long-term future.

(Johannes Simon/Getty Images)Even here, certain elements are more practical than ideological. Both Western organizations and Russian oppositionists can play an important role in training the next generation of democratically minded lawyers, civil servants, journalists, and politicians, says Hall. &#x201C;There needs to be a preparedness for the future, and that includes training those who can change Russia&#x2019;s institutions - the parliament, the Federation Council &#x2013; and actually make them what they should be rather than what Putin has turned them into.&#x201D; A more in-depth vision of Russia&#x2019;s future will be a more difficult task. While organizations such as the Anti-War Committee of Russia and the Russian Action Committee, co-founded by Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, do meet regularly, some major opposition players &#x2013; notably the FBK &#x2013; are not at the table. While this continues, there can be no unified vision of what a democratic Russia could be. &quot;The opposition has to come up with a coherent set of ideas,&quot; says Hall. &#x201C;Putin is human, and therefore, he will die &#x2013; and hopefully soon. Until that happens, there&apos;s no point in spending all this time procrastinating or fighting. There needs to be a plan for what comes next &#x2013; one that the Russian elites can buy into, if necessary.&#x201D; Such unity matters not only as a blueprint for the future but also as a message for Russians today. &#x201C;A united opposition would make it so much harder for the security services and for the presidential administration to emphasize that repeated message to Russians: that there is only Putin,&#x201D; says Hall. &#x201C;It would give hope.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/torn-apart-by-infighting-without-a-plan-what-comes-next-for-russias-opposition/	2024-10-22T07:28:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2091828783.jpg
G7 plans to keep Russian assets frozen after war in Ukraine ends, Nikkei reports	The Group of Seven (G7) plans to keep Russian assets frozen even after the end of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Japanese news agency Nikkei reported on Oct. 22, citing its undisclosed sources from G7. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the European Union has devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. G7 leaders will issue a joint statement in October saying that &quot;Russia&apos;s sovereign assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,&quot; according to the draft prepared by this year&apos;s chair, Italy. The bloc will also guarantee a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, Nikkei reported, citing the draft. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed a deal to provide Ukraine with the $50 billion loan by the end of the year. The loan will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) as part of that pledge. In October, the World Bank&apos;s executive committee approved the creation of a new fund to help fulfill G7&apos;s $50 billion loan. Estimates of the damage that Russia&apos;s aggression has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure over the past decade vary. The World Bank said in February that it could be as high as $486 billion. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the loan. EU officials have said that the loan would be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-plans-to-keep-russian-assets-frozen-after-russias-war-in-ukraine-ends-media-says/	2024-10-22T07:09:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156738800.jpg
Germany 'skeptical' about Ukraine's NATO membership, Zelensky says	Germany still &quot;has skepticism&quot; about Ukraine joining NATO, fearing Russia&apos;s reaction, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. Speaking at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, Zelensky stressed that a majority of NATO countries have reached a consensus on an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance, which would be granted within the internationally recognized borders of the country. &quot;Today we see support from France. We understand that the British will support us, and we believe that the Italians will support us,&quot; the president said. But he added the position among several countries including Germany remains restrained. &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky added. The president voiced hope that Washington&apos;s reaction would be &quot;more positive&quot; after the U.S. presidential election in early November. Talking to journalists, Zelensky did not rule out that &quot;some partners&quot; may think about Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO in exchange for the occupied territories. &quot;We are not discussing this,&quot; he said. &quot;This invitation, I believe, does not depend on Russia&apos;s opinion. When some other partners are convinced that they are stronger than Russia, then we will have a positive outcome in this sense.&quot; The invitation to NATO membership is also extended to internationally recognized borders of the country, Zelensky said. &quot;This is not just an invitation, but an invitation while the war is still ongoing. And what kind of accession, how it will take place, how long &#x2014; this is the next step, diplomacy.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks come days after he publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said that the alliance does not currently have such plans. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-discussing-nato-membership-in-exchange-for-the-occupied-territories-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T06:26:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2150217708.jpeg
Opinion: Shifting the paradigm in Ukraine	Last month, a Russian missile blew apart an apartment building in the center of Lviv. I sent a message to a friend who lives there: Was everyone okay? &#x201C;Yes, we were lucky,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;Our friends who live just next to us, a young woman and her three daughters, are dead.&#x201D; Then I saw the footage. The neighbor, Yaroslav Bazylevych, his face cut and bloodied, watched as the bodies of that young woman &#x2013; his wife &#x2013; and their three daughters were pulled from the rubble. A photo from the funeral, showing Bazylevych staring into the open coffins, should enter the pantheon of iconic images of atrocity: the little Jewish boy with his arms raised in the Warsaw Ghetto, the naked Vietnamese girl fleeing her village after a napalm attack, the body of the two-year-old Syrian boy washed ashore on a Turkish beach. The hypersonic Kinzhal missile that killed the Bazylevych family, like the one that hit the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital in Kyiv two months earlier, was fired from deep inside Russia. The launch sites are not a mystery; the Ukrainians know where they are. The missile that killed Yaroslav&#x2019;s wife, Evgeniya, and their daughters was launched from a MiG-31K aircraft in Russia&#x2019;s Tula Oblast. The aircraft took off from Savasleyka, a military air base about 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Moscow, about 866 kilometers (538 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and 1,386 kilometers (861 miles) from Lviv. By car, the drive would take over 20 hours; a Kinzhal can travel that far in as little as seven minutes. But Ukrainians are not permitted to use the weapons Americans have provided to destroy the launching sites; they have to wait for the missiles to arrive. Everyone knows it is absurd, but it is not their decision. It is the decision of the U.S. government, and in fact of one man, President Joe Biden &#x2013; a good man with the right moral instincts, but a man who has been unable to see beyond the paradigm of &#x201C;escalation avoidance,&#x201D; long after that paradigm has become perverse and deadly. Admittedly, it is hard to extricate ourselves from long-held paradigms and see the world anew, all the more so as we age. We are always attached to the previous reality. War and revolution rupture time, throw it &#x201C;out of joint&#x201D; in Hamlet&#x2019;s words. Suddenly, a state of affairs that has prevailed for years or decades ceases, as if in an instant, to exist. Yet the thinking shaped by it can linger long afterward. This is especially poignant in Biden&#x2019;s case. In October 1991, he chaired the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, presiding over hearings to investigate law professor Anita Hill&#x2019;s claims that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her a decade earlier. Thomas&#x2019;s defenders portrayed Hill as a rebuffed single woman prone to chasing male attention. John Doggett, a Texas attorney and friend of Thomas called to testify on Thomas&#x2019;s behalf, recounted that Hill had once expressed disappointment when he canceled a dinner date. &#x201C;Ms. Hill&#x2019;s fantasies about my sexual interest in her were an indication of the fact that she was having a problem with being rejected by men she was attracted to,&#x201D; Doggett told the committee. Biden responded to Doggett&#x2019;s claim: &#x201C;It seems to me that is a true leap in faith or ego, one of the two.&#x201D; Yaroslav Bazylevch visits the graves of his wife and their three daughters, who were killed in a Russian missile attack on Sept. 4, 2024, that hit their home, at a cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sept. 15, 2024. (Oksana Parafeniuk/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Emergency and rescue personnel clear rubble from the Okhmadyt children&apos;s hospital, destroyed in a Russian missile attack amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Listening over the radio 33 years ago, I understood that Biden believed Hill and cringed at her humiliation. He took care to emphasize that she had not wanted to come forward. Still, Biden lacked the daring to step outside of his assigned role, to see the situation anew. But the inclination to avoid radicalism can have radical consequences. Biden&#x2019;s moral sensibility was respectable, but his failure to take a bold step had dire repercussions, for it allowed Thomas to take his seat on the Court. The moral bankruptcy of today&#x2019;s Supreme Court, in which Thomas plays a key role, has left Americans facing an aspiring dictator whom that Court, in a decision supported by Thomas, has now granted near-total impunity. It is not ill will or callousness that has defined Biden&#x2019;s career, but rather a lack of daring. Indeed, that seems to be the tragic flaw of a fundamentally decent man. In a world where narcissistic psychopaths exert a disproportionate influence in shaping events, Biden stands out for his empathy. But that is not &#x2013; and cannot be &#x2013; enough. History moves through an interaction between the structural conditions in which we find ourselves and the choices we make. Sometimes the role of individual choice emerges with particular acuity, for better or worse: Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s &#x201C;bold experimentation&#x201D; to overcome the Great Depression, for example, or Neville Chamberlain&#x2019;s appeasement of Adolf Hitler at Munich. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s refusal of the U.S. government&#x2019;s offer to evacuate him as Russian tanks rumbled toward Kyiv was another such moment. While the Kremlin&#x2019;s assassins hunted him in the capital, Zelensky walked out onto the city streets at night and recorded a selfie video. &#x201C;The president is here,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We are all here.&#x201D; Suddenly, nothing was as expected. Ukraine would not fall in three days, as Vladimir Putin had predicted, and be reduced to a Belarus-style Russian protectorate. A massive land war on the European continent, considered impossible before Feb. 24, 2022, had suddenly become the great fact of the early 21st century. This unlearning to unsee is Biden&#x2019;s task today. He is no longer young, and his time remaining in power is short. Yet he still can &#x2013; and should &#x2013; take a risk, shift the paradigm, and embrace the possibilities, and the demands, of a new historical moment. &#x201C;The miracle that saves the world ... from its normal, &#x2018;natural&#x2019; ruin,&#x201D; Hannah Arendt wrote, &#x201C;is ultimately the fact of natality.&#x201D; By natality, she meant not only the literal birth of a new generation, but also the new beginnings arising from humans&#x2019; capacity to act. For Arendt, action possesses the quality of birth, its consequences unpredictable by its very nature. In Ukraine, inaction &#x2013; the refusal to permit Ukraine&#x2019;s government to act in self-defense &#x2013; possesses the quality of death. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

North Korea helping Russia in Ukraine 'for money,' Zelensky says	North Korea is supporting Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine for financial gain, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. Speaking at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, Zelensky was asked about Pyongyang&apos;s increasing support for Moscow, which in recent days is reported to have developed from just weapons to boots on the ground. &quot;I think it&apos;s because of the money,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I think North Korea is very poor, so they will send their people to the front.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement, pledging to provide aid to one another if either is attacked. With Russia&apos;s military stocks running low and domestic production capacity simultaneously hampered by Western sanctions, North Korea has been shaping up to be Russia&apos;s leading weapons supplier. Moscow has reportedly received extensive military packages from Pyongyang, including ballistic missiles and millions of artillery shells. The financial details of the arrangement have not been made public, but in exchange for ammunition already supplied, Russia has reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. Zelensky also said he believed North Korean troops would struggle to operate effectively while fighting for Russia. &quot;We located officers and technical personnel in temporarily occupied territories (of Ukraine),&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I think they sent the officers because their officers would understand what was going on first, and then send the contingent. &quot;But how do you manage them? How do you command them? I&apos;m talking about language. I think these are serious difficulties.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-helping-russia-in-ukraine-for-money-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T05:50:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340621.jpg
US to provide Ukraine with another $800 million to boost domestic long-range capabilities, Zelensky says	The U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. On the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a new $400 million military aid package during a surprise visit to Kyiv. In addition, it was also announced that Washington is preparing to provide $800 million for the production of Ukrainian drones. &quot;Then there should be also the next tranche in the amount of $700-800 million,&quot; Zelensky said at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, in reference to the package designated for long-range capabilities. Zelensky and Austin also discussed how much of the $8 billion in aid the U.S. announced in late September could be dedicated to Ukrainian production by the end of the year. Domestically produced long-range weapons are key to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-with-another-800-million-to-boost-ukraines-long-range-production-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T05:09:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Putin hosts BRICS summit in Russia but Brazilian and Cuban leaders cancel attendance	The leaders of Brazil and Cuba both canceled their attendance at this week&apos;s BRICS summit, being hosted in Russia by President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Regrettably, as it became known today, President of Brazil Lula da Silva and President of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel will not be able to come due to unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said in comments reported by Russian state media on Oct. 21. Lula, 78, is reported to have suffered a minor brain hemorrhage after falling at his home at the weekend, and will instead appear by videoconference. Diaz-Canel is suffering &quot;serious energy problems,&quot; Russian state media reported. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined the international organization at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Cuba has requested to join the BRICS group as a &quot;partner country&quot; in an official letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Cuban Foreign Ministry official said on Oct. 8. With Russia increasingly isolated on the international stage, and forced to turn to countries like North Korea for support, Moscow is hoping the summit can send a message to Western nations that it can still yield some clout. The Kremlin described the three-day meeting which began on Oct. 22 as one of the &quot;largest-scale foreign policy events ever&quot; in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-hosts-brics-summit-in-russia-but-brazilian-and-cuban-leaders-cancel-attendance/	2024-10-22T04:28:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178339508.jpg
As the Baltics raise the alarm about Russia, Washington still not listening	For Zygimantas Pavilionis, a member of the Lithuanian parliament, history is repeating itself: The Kremlin&#x2019;s military sights are set on Europe beyond Ukraine and the U.S. is not listening to warnings from the Baltics. &#x201C;In Europe, they listen to the Baltics, but in America, they are so arrogant that they don&#x2019;t listen,&#x201D; Pavilionis said. On top of its all-out war in Ukraine, Russia has recently driven up tensions around the NATO-allied Baltic states &#x2014; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania &#x2014; as well as nearby Finland and Sweden, raising concerns about its intentions in the area. Over the past year, Russia has made several moves in the Baltic Sea area, including GPS jamming, removing boundary markers in the Narva River that separates Russia and Estonia, and a brief attempt to change the maritime border between Lithuania and Finland. Earlier in May, Micael Byden, the commander of the Swedish Armed Service, the military protecting NATO&#x2019;s newest member, also warned that the Kremlin may be seeking dominance over the Baltic Sea and has his eye on Sweden&#x2019;s island of Gotland. A lot has changed since the time leading up to 2014 when Russia launched its aggression against Ukraine, and when Baltic state officials say their warnings of larger Russian threats on the Trans-Atlantic community often went ignored. But despite its full-scale invasion in 2022 and recent escalations, some from the Baltics say Washington still isn&#x2019;t heeding their warnings of the threat of Russia &#x2014; one the countries know intimately after over half a century of Soviet occupation and decades of bordering modern-day Russia, making them some of Ukraine&#x2019;s strongest advocates in the U.S. capital. A member of the Lithuanian parliament, Zygimantas Pavilionis, listens to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack and the Republic of Lithuania Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius during their meeting in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 8, 2014. (Lance Cheung / USDA Photo)If they were listening, aid to Ukraine wouldn&#x2019;t have been delayed, Kyiv&#x2019;s pleas to lift a ban on Western-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and cripple its war machine would be granted, and NATO would consider strengthening its eastern flank, Pavilionis said. U.S. presidential elections on the horizon also make the stakes especially high as they could see Donald Trump return to the White House. The former Republican president, espousing isolationist views, has criticized aid to Ukraine, repeatedly flaunted his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and called into question NATO&#x2019;s existence. Trump&apos;s vice presidential pick JD Vance has said he &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t care&#x201D; what happens to Ukraine, leading to fears that a Republican-led U.S. would mean the worst for Ukraine and the entire region. Only one Republican skeptical of the then-stalled Ukraine aid package of $61 billion took a meeting back in February with a Baltic delegation, according to Pavilionis, which is why he both then and now calls for members of Congress to &#x201C;wake up.&#x201D; &#x201C;(American isolation) would mean war in the Baltics,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. While war may be unlikely in the region&#x2019;s direct future, the three Baltic nations are not sitting idle. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lead NATO in defense spending. As a percent of gross domestic product, Estonia is set to spend 3.43% on defense in 2024, well above NATO&#x2019;s 2% guidelines and America&#x2019;s 2.7%,a drop from 5.7% during the Cold War. Just recently, Lithuania said it had blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman River linking it to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Their knowledge of the threats, which also include cyber attacks in addition to maritime menaces, is also behind a lot of their lobbying in support of Ukraine. Numerous lawmakers who spoke with the Kyiv Independent said there is bipartisan consensus that the Baltic states remain some of the most effective voices in Washington to further support for Ukraine. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;There&apos;s probably no better advocates for Ukraine than the Baltic countries,&#x201D; Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who is co-chair of the House Baltics Caucus, said. Their support &#x2014; and understanding of the risks &#x2014; is evidenced in disproportionately high levels of military support for Ukraine. The Baltic states, despite having a collective smaller population than New York City, were among the top four donors in aid to Ukraine this summer. As some Republicans continually criticize European countries for not spending an equal percentage of their budget on aid for Ukraine as the U.S., it&#x2019;s appreciated how the Baltics have punched above their weight in support of Kyiv, according to a Senate foreign policy aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Convincing its Western allies to act decisively in supporting Ukraine is another story. &#x201C;It takes a lot of explaining to connect the dots,&#x201D; Estonia&#x2019;s U.S. Ambassador Kristjan Prikk told the Kyiv Independent, describing how he explains to U.S. officials that Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine isn&#x2019;t just about Putin wanting Kyiv, it&#x2019;s also his undermining of the U.S. &#x201C;Quite often our role has been to spell it out and explain to people what&#x2019;s at stake.&#x201D; When Ambassador Prikk served in Washington over a decade ago during the three years preceding Crimea&#x2019;s annexation, explaining Russia&#x2019;s threat to the West was immensely difficult, he said. At times, his warnings of Russia&#x2019;s threats to European security would even go ignored. Today, I met with Speakers of the Baltic states to discuss ongoing challenges that face our countries. We discussed the importance of deterring threats like China, Russia, and Iran, and we noted the importance of viable U.S. energy production for the Baltics and the risks posed&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/RUNAV6DKOx &#x201C;(Baltic countries) have a good story to tell and people to a degree are listening,&#x201D; Jeremy Shapiro, a U.S. foreign policy expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said. In February when Ukraine&#x2019;s $61 billion aid package was held up in Washington, parliamentary speakers from each Baltic nation met with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, delivering a message that Russia will act on any sign that Western support of Ukraine is waning. Johnson then received a letter in April shortly before allowing the aid to pass from his Baltic counterparts requesting he deliver the &#x201C;indispensable aid&#x201D; to Ukraine. &#x201C;Supporting Ukraine is an investment in our collective secure future,&#x201D; the letter said. Even though Prikk says the Baltics are increasingly listened to because of the region&apos;s &#x201C;credibility&#x201D; given Russian drones exploding in Latvia and other examples of the region&#x2019;s proximity to Russia, it&#x2019;s a matter of constant work. With the Middle East&#x2019;s widening war competing for U.S. resources, the elongated presence of Cold War-era Washington officials, and a swift news cycle atop a condensed attention span, explaining Russia&#x2019;s threat to Washington is like cycling, you can&#x2019;t stop pedaling, he said. &#xA0; With a few hundred American troops based indefinitely in the Baltics and $228 million in U.S. aid approved for the region&#x2019;s three countries this year, some would like to see a larger NATO military presence in the region as tensions between Russia and NATO escalate. Congressman Bacon said the U.S. needs to do more to build up air defenses in the Baltics, likely meaning more American troops in the region. &#xA0; &#x201C;We need to be there for deterrence,&#x201D; Rep. Bacon, a former Air Force general said. &#x201C;I know the Russians know we&#x2019;re there and that&#x2019;s what counts.&#x201D; Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a member of the Senate&#x2019;s Baltic Freedom Caucus, said Russia ought to know that the U.S. is ready to defend its obligations to fellow NATO members.

(Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s very necessary that the U.S. makes it very clear that we consider the Baltics in our sphere and not Russia&#x2019;s.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got to spend more on our own defense because we&#x2019;re relatively weak now,&#x201D; Sen. Grassley said, referencing American preparedness in the face of adversarial hostility. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel very secure.&#x201D; Disagreements remain on the Hill over whether more U.S. troops should be in the Baltics near Russia&#x2019;s westernmost NATO border. The worry is that more U.S. personnel near Russia, whether troops in the Baltics or diplomats in Ukraine, could trigger Russian escalation. The Baltic states likely want a permanent presence of a few border divisions, according to Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just not going to happen because those (troops,) if they&#x2019;re deployed there, then they can&#x2019;t be used anywhere else,&#x201D; Daalder said. Ambassador Prikk says the region isn&#x2019;t asking for more U.S. troops, just military training and a defense plan. Even if the region was demanding more troops, there are still worries that the Baltics don&#x2019;t fully have Washington&#x2019;s ear. It&#x2019;s not that the U.S. isn&#x2019;t listening, Daalder said, it&#x2019;s that the realities of being a global ally an ocean away come into play when Russia&#x2019;s threat is singular and existential for the Baltics but not for the U.S., despite being critical. Pavilionis, who is also a former U.S. Ambassador said he too hopes NATO enlargement will be a focus for the next White House come January. Rep.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The spectre of Trump A potential second Donald Trump presidency throws America&#x2019;s commitment to the alliances into question, not least because of the former president&#x2019;s critical remarks of the alliance in the past. One of the reasons Pavillionis believes the Baltics need to escalate their diplomatic efforts in Washington is because of the influence he says autocratic countries are having amongst Republicans. In September, the U.S. State Department said the Russian state-run media outlet RT was actively working with Russian intelligence to spread propaganda in the U.S. partly in an attempt to push U.S. viewers toward voting for Trump. Particularly concerning for the Baltics is the pro-Russian messaging of far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson, and his success in retaining the ear of elected Republicans. Sen. Grassley said he &#x201C;worries a lot&#x201D; about the praise some members of his party have for Carlson and Putin, but added that it is partly a messaging issue that many Americans are unaware that billions of American aid for Ukraine is spent in the U.S. Ambassador Prikk said that navigating pro-Kremlin sentiment amongst the right in Washington has been an unusual challenge. And the last time Pavillionis was in Washington in early 2024, every third Republican on the Hill was speaking like Putin, he said. &#x201C;We have to take care of this infiltration of autocracies inside the Republican party.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-better-advocate-for-ukraine-the-baltics-crucial-presence-in-washington/	2024-10-22T03:01:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2105323303.jpg
North Korea denies sending troops to join Russia's war in Ukraine, dismisses 'groundless rumors'	North Korea has claimed reports it has sent soldiers to fight with Russia against Ukraine are &quot;groundless rumors,&quot; the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 22, citing a North Korean representative to the United Nations. The statement is Pyongyang&apos;s first public reaction to multiple reports of such a deployment from Kyiv and Seoul. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Speaking at the U.N. meeting, the North Korean representative described relations between Pyongyang and Moscow as &quot;legitimate, friendly and cooperative.&quot; &quot;As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumors aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK,&quot; he said. The Kremlin on Oct. 21 called such reports &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 North Korean soliders had already been sent to Russia. Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they&apos;d be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia has also surfaced online. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-denies-alleged-troops-sending-to-fight-russian-war-as-groundless-rumors/	2024-10-22T03:00:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157775748.jpg
UK to provide Ukraine with $2.9 billion military loan, to be repaid with proceeds from frozen Russian assets	London will provide Ukraine with a loan worth &#xA3;2.26 billion ($2.9 billion) backed by profits from frozen Russian assets, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The funds are the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the Group of Seven (G7)&apos;s initiative to provide Kyiv with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year, which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. The U.K.&apos;s loan will be allocated to Ukraine&apos;s military spendings. Kyiv will be able to invest in key equipment to fight Russia, such as artillery, air defense, and wider equipment support, the statement read. &quot;This new money is in Britain&#x2019;s national interest because the front line of our defense &#x2014; the defense of our democracy and shared values &#x2014; is in the Ukrainian trenches,&quot; said Rachel Reeves, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer. &quot;A safe and secure Ukraine is a safe and secure United Kingdom.&quot; British Defense Minister John Healey said the money could be used to help Kyiv develop long-range drones capable of travelling further than some missiles. The aid comes on top of the UK&apos;s existing 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) a year assistance for Ukraine. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the EU devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-ukraine-with-2-9-billion-loan-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-22T02:18:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179782562.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 10, injure 42 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed 10 people and injured 42 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 22. Ukrainian forces downed 46 out of 60 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ten more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; three others flew back towards Russia and one drone entered Belarusian airspace, it added. Houses came under attack in the city of Sumy. Three people, including a child, were killed, and one more person suffered injuries, according to local authorities. A Russian missile attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed three people and injured 19, including an eight-year-old girl, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

Seoul considering sending military personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops, Yonhap reports	South Korea is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops that Russia may involve in its full-scale war, Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22, citing an unnamed government source. &quot;There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&quot; the source said. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. If deployed, a South Korean team may include military personnel from intelligence units who will be able to analyze Pyongyang&apos;s warfare tactics or participate in the interrogations of captured North Koreans. The government is also reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. The source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly. While the U.S. has been cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-considering-sending-military-personnel-to-ukraine-to/	2024-10-22T00:48:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167507180.jpg
Ukrainian drones target Russian alcohol plants overnight, local authorities claim	Ukrainian drones attacked four plants in Tula, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts in Russia overnight on Oct. 22, Russian local authorities claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses destroyed 11 drones over Bryansk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, two over Kursk Oblast, one over Tula Oblast, and one over Orel Oblast. In Tambov Oblast, a Ukrainian drone reportedly set to fire the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo, according to Governor Maxim Egorov. According to the Biokhim website, it produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol, a solvent which is used in the manufacture of a wide range of products including explosives. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast overnight, Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed a drone attack caused a minor fire on one of the floors of an industrial enterprise. No casualties have reported. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-4-plants-in-russia-overnight-local-authorities-claim/	2024-10-21T23:14:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-22-085130.png
Polish officials seek access to classified sections of Ukraine's victory plan	Warsaw is seeking to review the classified additions to Ukraine&apos;s victory plan recently presented by President Volodymyr Zelensky, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Teofil Bartoszewsk said in an interview on Oct. 21. Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, presented on October 17, includes five main points and three confidential appendices. During the presentation of the victory plan, Zelensky mentioned that the complete text would remain confidential and only select partners crucial for its execution would be granted access to the classified appendices of specific sections. Bartoszewsk noted that Poland is not among the countries that received full details of the plan, and emphasized Poland&apos;s significant military support to Ukraine. &quot;We provided Ukraine with military aid in the most crucial way, because when Germany was talking about sending them helmets, we sent 320 tanks. So our contribution was obviously significant, especially at the beginning when it was most needed,&quot; he said. The victory plan consists of the following requests: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 18 that Ukraine&apos;s victory plan will be reassessed after the upcoming U.S. presidential election. At the same time, Tusk emphasized that Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership has not changed. &quot;We stand in solidarity with Ukraine on this issue,&quot; he said. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-officials-seek-access-to-classified-sections-of-ukraines-victory-plan/	2024-10-21T22:23:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/poland.jpeg

Russia executed 2 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors say	Russian soldiers executed two captured Ukrainian soldiers near Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, the Donetsk regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported on Oct. 21. On Oct. 18, during an attack on Ukrainian positions, Russian forces captured the two unarmed soldiers, forced them face down, and later shot them at close range. This execution is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is considered a serious international crime. Ukrainian law enforcement has launched a criminal investigation under the laws of war. Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has informed the UN and Red Cross about the incident in order to document it. Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-executed-2-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-21T20:05:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Cargo plane shot down in Sudan, Russian nationals possibly on board	Sudan&apos;s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have shot down a cargo plane in Darfur, with speculation that Russian nationals may have been on board. The aircraft, identified as an Ilyushin Il-76 from Kyrgyzstan, had documents connecting it to a UAE-based company. The RSF released mobile phone footage showing identity documents recovered from the crash site, including a Russian passport. Additionally, the RSF stated that &quot;foreign mercenaries&quot; were killed in the operation, further implying the potential presence of Russian citizens. This connection raises concerns about the involvement of Russian mercenaries or private contractors in Sudan&#x2019;s ongoing conflict, which has seen various international actors entangled. Russia maintains a strong presence in African countries like Sudan through Wagner and other entities, propping up authoritarian governments, fueling destabilization, and extracting resources to fund its war against Ukraine. Claims have previously appeared in other media publications that Ukrainian special forces took part in operations in Sudan and are responsible for strikes against Wagner-backed militants. According to the WSJ, Sudan&apos;s de facto ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, appealed to Ukraine for assistance in the summer of 2023 while besieged by rebel forces. Kyiv responded positively in order to curb Russia&apos;s influence abroad, but also because &quot;Burhan had been quietly supplying Kyiv with weapons since shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022,&quot; the outlet wrote. Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Khartoum issued a statement confirming that its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan&#x2019;s Malha region, near the border with Chad.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-shot-down-in-sudan-russian-nationals-possibly-on-board/	2024-10-21T19:21:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/sudan.jpg
US to provide Ukraine with $800 million for drone production, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 21 that the U.S. will provide $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, aimed at funding the production of drones to strengthen the country&apos;s defense capabilities. &quot;Every meeting with our partners involves discussions about the defense-industrial complex,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;We need Ukraine to be able to defend its sovereignty and independence regardless of any political threats in the world.&quot; The announcement followed Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, where the Pentagon chief announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine. The package included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at an event a Kyiv Independent journalist attended. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in early 2022, the United States has committed more than $60 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-800-million-for-drone-production-zelensky-says/	2024-10-21T15:25:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174412815.jpg
Opinion: Money-laundering watchdog FATF needs to blacklist Russia	The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meets tomorrow, Oct. 22, and is expected to once again debate Russia&#x2019;s blacklisting. That Russia, a clear state sponsor of terrorism, hasn&#x2019;t been ousted from an intergovernmental body that sets global standards to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and related financial crimes, is incredible. It&#x2019;s remarkable that Russia isn&#x2019;t already on the FATF blacklist alongside North Korea and Iran. Just ask the CEO of Germany&#x2019;s biggest arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, whom Russia plotted to kill, or consider the Russian bomb plots thwarted by the postal services in the U.K. and Germany. MI5 and its German equivalent have also recently flagged Russia&#x2019;s growing terrorist threat. Russia continues to violate sanctions and encourages others to do the same. As reported by the Financial Times and others, shadow fleets are circumventing sanctions with Russia&#x2019;s support. It would be a fitting move for U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to finally push for Russia&#x2019;s FATF blacklisting. Should a Donald Trump presidency follow, keeping Russia on the blacklist could serve as a bargaining chip for future peace negotiations over Ukraine. In recent months, the mounting pressure on Russia&#x2019;s economy has been evident. The ruble is approaching 100 to the dollar, inflation is rising, and Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank has had to hike interest rates to stabilize the currency and counter inflation. These economic challenges partially reflect new sanctions, including measures against the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and tightened secondary sanctions that make it harder for third-party countries, like China and India, to trade with Russia. Shipping containers sit on rail trailers at a logistics hug on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia, on April 9, 2024. (Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Tightening sanctions on Russia serves several important purposes. First, it weakens Russia&#x2019;s economy, making it harder and more expensive to regenerate its military and wage war on Ukraine. Second, while sanctions were initially imposed in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it&#x2019;s now clear that Russia poses a broader threat to Western interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes he&#x2019;s at war with the West and NATO, so it&apos;s in NATO&#x2019;s interest to weaken Russia&#x2019;s military capabilities. Sanctions help degrade that threat. Third, sanctions damage the Russian economy, giving Ukraine and the West leverage in future negotiations. For this reason, FATF blacklisting Russia makes strategic sense for the West. It&#x2019;s notable that FATF was originally created to counter the threat of Islamist terrorism after 9/11. One argument against blacklisting Russia is that it plays a key role in countering these same radical Islamist groups. However, recent events suggest Russia now poses a greater terrorist threat to the West than these organizations. Moreover, its alliances with Iran and North Korea &#x2013; now supplying 10,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine &#x2013; underscore its alignment with other FATF-blacklisted states. Blacklisting Russia would send a clear message: aligning with Iran and North Korea to wage war against Ukraine and attack Western interests has consequences. A potential counterargument is that blacklisting Russia could reduce its cooperation in fighting Islamist extremism, a key reason FATF was founded. However, given the growing threat Russia faces from these same radical groups, as seen in recent attacks, including the Moscow theater incident, Russia&#x2019;s cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is unlikely to wane. It remains in Russia&#x2019;s interest to address these threats, and FATF blacklisting shouldn&#x2019;t change that.

Is NATO ready for war with Russia?	The launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 confronted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with a new geopolitical reality. Described as &quot;braindead&quot; by French President Emmanuel Macron only a few years prior, the alliance woke up to a threat previously thought consigned to the past: a full-out conventional land war on the European continent. Military officials have since churned out warnings of a resurgent Russian threat to NATO, saying allies must be ready in three, five, or eight years&apos; time. &#x201C;The Russian Federation has become a problem for the world order, for democracy. In fact, it is a war of Russia with the democratic world. It is not (just) a war with Ukraine,&#x201D; Romanian Defense Chief Gheorghita Vlad said in February of this year. After decades of fighting insurgents rather than armies, underfunded European forces still sobering up from the post-Cold War &quot;peace dividend years,&quot; and the shadow of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House, NATO&apos;s readiness for such a clash lies in doubt. &quot;NATO could not defeat Russia given its current capabilities without incurring significant cost in terms of casualties, damage, and temporary loss of territorial sovereignty,&#x201D; Gordon B. Davis, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank and NATO&#x2019;s former deputy assistant secretary general, told the Kyiv Independent. Collectively, the 32 members of NATO can field a powerful, and modern fighting force, but &#x2014; its European contingent at least &#x2014; faces ammunition shortages, a fragmented defense industry, and insufficient air defense coverage. Then there is the question of unity and the will of Western societies to make sacrifices in a costly and prolonged war.

(Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)NATO&#x2019;s capabilities Despite years-long decline, NATO can still pack a punch. In many aspects, even the European part of the alliance can outgun Russian forces, boasting a larger number of active duty personnel, advanced long-range capabilities like Taurus or Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, and larger, more modern airpower. While NATO, not counting the U.S., has roughly 1.9 million active personnel, 2,400 combat-ready aircraft, and 6,650 tanks as of 2024, Russia has estimated 1.1 million active troops, 1,370 aircraft, and 2,000 tanks, according to the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). NATO also grew stronger with the accession of two new members &#x2014; Sweden and Finland &#x2014; adding two well-trained and interoperable militaries to the alliance and a more than 1,300-kilometer-long border for Russia to defend. &quot;There is still an overwhelming ability by NATO for death and destruction in terms of long-range fire, anything launched from the fleet of F-35 (advanced jet fighters), for example,&quot; Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said in comments for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If they (Russia) fought how they fight now, in Ukraine, against a NATO force, they would be destroyed pretty quickly,&quot; he added, referring to Russia&apos;s high-mortality &quot;meat grinder Storm-Z tactics.&quot; Davis agrees that NATO would have the upper hand but wouldn&apos;t avoid losses. &quot;Assuming a conventional fight only, NATO would outfight Russia&apos;s air forces and naval fleets, although its bombers, drones, and submarines would succeed in striking NATO territory and forces,&quot; he said, adding the alliance &quot;would defeat Russian ground forces, but not necessarily prevent them from taking territory.&quot; Many NATO planners have named the Baltic states as the most vulnerable to attack, situated as they are next to Russia, its staunch ally Belarus, and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the 40-kilometer-wide Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic states. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Shock-and-awe vs. the long haulNATO might have the upper hand in a quick, &quot;shock-and-awe&quot; war where their superior firepower would quickly decimate Russian forces. The question is: would this be that kind of war? The Kremlin is certainly aware of its weaknesses and strengths in comparison to its chief geopolitical opponent. As the first year of the full-scale invasion demonstrated, the Russian state and society were ready to absorb initial losses and reconstitute for a long fight. &quot;The majority of the combat experience within NATO forces are from Afghanistan, which is very, very different&#x2026; from what might happen in a potential war between NATO and Russia,&quot; Arnold said. Roughly 3,600 coalition troops were killed in 20 years of the Afghanistan War. The estimates of Russian troops killed in two and half years in Ukraine were placed at around 200,000. Western societies are likely to be much more sensitive to casualties, and their factories and armories have proven unprepared even for a sustained support of Ukraine. Insiders told the Kyiv Independent last month that part of the reason behind slow-paced U.S. aid packages is empty Pentagon shelves. The EU was forced to postpone its promised 1 million shells to Ukraine due to the &quot;lamentable state of the defense industry.&quot; Alternatively, using &quot;salami-tactics&quot; &#x2014; gradually using a series of small military actions rather than one big one &#x2014; would test allied unity and courage to respond. Rather than marching to Berlin or Paris, Russia could try to grab and hold a chunk of the Baltics and ward off any counterattack with the threats of a massive &#x2014; even nuclear &#x2014; escalation. Nuclear weaponry remains the wild card and the Kremlin is not shy about threatening the use of its atomic arsenal. A recent change to its doctrine lowered the threshold for a nuclear response in a gesture obviously aimed at Western powers.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)NATO catching upIn a written comment for the Kyiv Independent, Davis provided a &quot;shopping list&quot; of NATO&apos;s main weak spots: &quot;Integrated air and missile defense, persistent surveillance, long to short range strike systems (including drones), land-based electronic warfare, ground munitions inventories (e.g., artillery, mortars, antitank), and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.&quot; &quot;NATO has exquisite capabilities in all these areas, but not in sufficient numbers, breadth, and depth in terms of stocks and defense production capabilities.&quot; One key reason behind these deficiencies was the peace dividend Europe enjoyed in the post-Cold War period. Believing that the specter of a full-blown conflict with Moscow was gone, European nations cut average defense funding from 2.4% to 1.6% of GDP between 1990 and 2000. Twenty-four countries abandoned conscription in the roughly two decades after 1990. While land forces of (West) Germany, Italy, France, and the U.K. could field 215, 135, 106, and 94 battalions in 1990, these numbers shrank to 33, 46, 44, and 50 by 2020, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says. The U.S. scaled down its presence as well. The alliance started slowly waking up to new realities in 2014 in the wake of the Russian war against Ukraine, the occupation of Crimea and the war in Donbas. &quot;The good news is (that) since 2014, starting with the Wales conference and every summit thereafter, we have truly increased the readiness of NATO,&quot; said retired U.S General Philip M. Breedlove, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR) in 2013-16, in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. Asked whether NATO is ready to face Russia today, Breedlove said: &quot;No, but we&apos;re way more ready than we were in 2014.&quot; The Wales summit saw the establishment of the Readiness Action Plan to bolster collective defense and deterrence. Two years later, NATO launched the Enhanced Forward Presence, deploying initially four, and later eight allied battalions along the alliance&apos;s eastern flank. By 2022, SACEUR commanded 40,000 troops from the Baltic to the Black Sea, in addition to tens of thousands of host countries&apos; troops, and some 100,000 U.S. soldiers in Europe. The preparations kicked into higher gear after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Madrid summit in 2022 saw allies adopt the NATO Force Model, a three-tier defense plan that would make 300,000 troops ready within a month, and half a million within half a year. This was in addition to increased aerial and naval readiness and exercises, such as this year&apos;s Steadfast Defender, which, with 90,000 troops, was the largest NATO drill since the Cold War.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Fresh funds began flowing into defense. Whereas in 2014, only three allies met the 2% of GDP threshold, this number grew to 19 &#x2014; including the newcomer Sweden &#x2014; &#xA0;a decade later. Some members are even calling for raising the benchmark. Since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine 10 years ago, the European allies have increased their defense spending by roughly a third to a total of $380 billion, CSIS&apos;s analysis said. In comparison, Russia&apos;s defense expenditures for the same year were around $110 billion, with much of it allocated to the war against Ukraine. While impressive on paper, many of these plans face challenges with implementation. The efforts to have 300,000 troops on a one-month standby are complicated by disputes between national and NATO authorities, and low enlistment levels in member countries. IISS analysts pointed out that only a few European militaries actually grew in size in the past decade. Despite new investments in defense production, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year that it could take up to two years before artillery shell manufacturing is at the desired level. The aforementioned long-range missiles, like Storm Shadow or Taurus, are not even currently in production, and the former is being used up in Ukraine, Arnold noted. In the end, the execution of these ambitious plans rests on the unity and political willingness of individual members, which may very well be NATO&apos;s Achilles&apos; heel. The possible return of Donald Trump to the White House is increasing concerns across European capitals. The former president famously said that he would encourage Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell it wants&quot; to those members who do not meet the defense spending benchmark. On the other side of the Atlantic, Hungary has been repeatedly breaking the allied consensus, and one official even recently implied that Budapest would not resist a Russian invasion. Populist and radical political forces are growing in Slovakia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Fatigue is also growing across the alliance, even though the current sacrifices mostly entail only small fractions of budgets and retired military hardware. &quot;The main weakness of NATO at the moment is that people just aren&apos;t on the same page with this (Russian) threat,&quot; Arnold said, underscoring the differences between countries in NATO&apos;s north and east on the one hand and the western part on the other. Another great uncertainty is the result of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently fully engaged and have suffered heavy losses. Their capability to reconstitute depends on when and how the war ends. The &quot;how&quot; is the most decisive factor. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said earlier this month that If NATO wants to avoid a clash with Russian forces, it needs to help Ukraine win. &quot;Should Russia be able to rebuild, restructure, and adapt its defense capabilities, and training and doctrine, following a conflict with Ukraine, it would pose an even greater threat to NATO,&quot; Davis warned.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-vs-russia-how-ready-is-the-alliance-for-war/	2024-10-21T12:18:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166545608.jpg
US has provided Ukraine with over $64 billion in military aid since start of full-scale invasion, Umerov says	The U.S. government has provided Ukraine with military aid worth over $64 billion since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 at the joint press briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv earlier in the day in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. During his visit, Austin also announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine, which included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Umerov said at an event attended by a Kyiv Independent journalist. Umerov mentioned that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. &quot;Our drones have become a real threat to the enemy. They can hit targets thousands of kilometers away and have already destroyed more than 200 military facilities in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s defense production potential might approach $20 billion,&quot; the minister said. Umerov also highlighted Austin&apos;s role in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as a Ramstein-format meeting. &quot;You have played a major role in bringing the free world together and coordinating the cooperation of more than 50 democracies to confront the threat posed by tyranny, to fight what seems now a coalition of dictatorships,&quot; Umerov added. Austin, in his turn, said that every time he is back at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where the group was forged, he finds it &quot;moving to look around that long table and to see in human form the global indignation over (Vladimir) Putin&apos;s crimes.&quot; The U.S. Defense Secretary also mentioned that, as a percentage of GDP, a &quot;dozen U.S. allies and partners&quot; now provide more security assistance to Ukraine than the U.S. does. The group members have provided over $1 billion in direct security assistance to Ukraine in total, he added. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The next meeting will be conducted in a virtual setting in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-provided-ukraine-with-over-64-billion-in-military-aid-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-umerov-says/	2024-10-21T12:00:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2169448523.jpg
Only death awaits them' – We asked 5 Ukrainian soldiers about North Korean troops fighting for Russia	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine is on the verge of escalating dramatically, with multiple reports, intelligence assessments, and a video suggesting North Korean troops could soon be fighting alongside Kremlin forces. While Pyongyang has long supplied Moscow with weaponry, the deployment of boots on the ground would mark a significant development that has raised alarm bells in capitals around the world. In the latest development on Oct. 21, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, and called for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with Pyongyang. While not confirming the deployment, Washington has said it is &quot;concerned&quot; about the reports. On Oct. 18, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to President Joe Biden to respond immediately. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied reports. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; Despite Peskov&apos;s vague statements, there is plenty of evidence to suggest North Korean troops are already in Russia training to partake in the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine in some capacity. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 had already been sent. Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they&apos;d be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia surfaced online.

And other people from Russia don&apos;t want to go to this war just for money; it&apos;s a very important sign. &quot;They will be very low-quality troops; they won&apos;t have experience of fighting in this war, so strategically it won&apos;t make a profound difference on the front line. &quot;If North Korea sends many more troops, again, it&apos;s a problem for them. They will have language problems. Ukraine also has experience with (foreign legion) soldiers, so we understand these difficulties. &quot;We must work with South Korea on this problem. We must create a special government program for soldiers to convince them to stop fighting and make a proposal that they can return to Korea, not to North Korea, but to South Korea. &quot;Because many people from North Korea try to run away from the regime to South Korea. This would be a really good program for them.&quot; &quot;We are already at war with one of the strongest countries. There is nothing to worry about. &quot;They shouldn&apos;t come here; only death awaits them here. Let them go AWOL (absent without official leave) straight away. This is not their war and not their country.&quot; &quot;It all depends on how many of them there will be. I&apos;ve heard that some have already been caught in Kursk Oblast. I don&apos;t think their quality is very high. North Korea is a country stuck somewhere in the 1950s-60s. &quot;Of course, this is bad because the more of them there are, the worse it is. (For us, it means) more work. &quot;We should influence them like everyone else through psychological operations, scattering leaflets. It&apos;s not a cure-all, but it&apos;s something even if one percent runs over to us and surrenders. &quot;On a large scale, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll have much impact on anything.&quot; In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (centre L) and North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un (centre R) attend a welcoming ceremony at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea on June 19, 2024. (Gavrill Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Petro Kyzyk, a battalion commander at the National Guard&quot;We will kill everyone who comes to our land as an occupier!&quot; &quot;Technically, Russia is fighting at the expense of its allies: Chinese drones, Iranian missiles and Shahed (drones), Chinese armored cars, North Korean missiles, ammunition&#x2026; And now soldiers. &quot;This speaks to the ridiculous problem that the &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; cannot defeat Ukraine, which is weak on its own and which the West is afraid to help appropriately, so it is sitting on scraps. &quot;But this also speaks to another terrible problem. The &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; is not just pulling what resources it can from its allies, no. It is beginning to fight in a coalition format. &quot;The West is providing little help and reacts sluggishly to the growing scale of the mess. Recent statistics showed that the average age of contract soldiers in the Russian army has reached 50 years. It was also said somewhere that the wounded were sent into battle. I believe the former and would like to believe the latter, but there is no evidence. &quot;Sign-up bonuses for joining the Russian army have increased dramatically over this year. This suggests they need to motivate people to join the army to avoid a general mobilization. &#x201C;Many &apos;experts&apos; bets are in jeopardy because many said Russia would soon run out of steam. But they have found another million-dollar secret place to draw meat from. This is scary. &quot;With another 10,000 more troops, Russia can at least not slow down much, and at most can receive a third of the personnel it needs every month. This is tangible.&quot; Additional reporting by Asami Terajima and Daria Shulzhenko.	https://kyivindependent.com/only-death-awaits-them-we-asked-5-ukrainian-soldiers-about-north-korean-troops-fighting-for-russia/	2024-10-21T11:26:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-843572642-1.jpg
Russian strikes against Pokrovsk district in Donetsk Oblast kill 3, injure 2	Russia attacked the towns of Kurakhove and Myrnohrad in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk Oblast on Oct. 21, killing three and injuring two people, local authorities reported. The eastern front near Pokrovsk has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The city is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. The Russian strike occurred at around 3 p.m. local time in Myrnohrad, which is only seven kilometers (five miles) away from Pokrovsk. A man and a woman were killed, while another man was injured. He suffered shrapnel wounds, the acting head of the town&apos;s military administration, Yurii Tretiak, told the Kyiv Independent. Some 33 houses and outbuildings were damaged in the town. Russian troops also attacked Kurakhove, located west of Russian-occupied Donetsk and some 30 km (18 miles) from the town of Pokrovsk. One person was killed, while another one was injured. The strike damaged a five-story building, as well as an administrative building in Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strikes-against-pokrovsk-district-in-donetsk-oblast-kill-3-injure-2/	2024-10-21T11:17:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/PHOTO-2024-10-21-18-52-56-1.jpg
Opinion: Moldova's EU integration referendum hangs in the balance, highlighting the dangers of oversimplification	Moldovans headed to the polls on Oct. 20 to elect their next head of state and vote on the future of the country&#x2019;s European Union integration. With over 98% of the votes counted on Monday, the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; vote edged ahead at 50.03%, while the &#x201C;no&#x201D; camp, which had maintained a lead since the counting began, stood at 49.97%, according to results from the election commission. President Maia Sandu&#x2019;s decision to align the referendum on amending the constitution for Moldova&#x2019;s EU accession with the first round of the presidential election was a strategic political move. This alignment was approved by the parliament, where Sandu&#x2019;s Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) holds a comfortable majority. To be clear, Sandu and PAS have accomplished more for Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration than all previous governments combined, including those that claimed to be &#x201C;pro-European.&#x201D; However, when it comes to the EU and referendums, I experience anxiety, especially when they seem unnecessary. For instance, we might have had a Constitutional Treaty instead of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the U.K. might still be a member, had politicians not posed a simple yes-or-no question about a complex issue. Not only does this approach narrow the debate &#x2013; offering virtually no alternative among other presidential candidates who also support EU membership &#x2013; but it also carries significant risks, as past examples have shown. During the 2016 Moldovan presidential election, the Kremlin attempted to influence the outcome through disinformation campaigns. While this interference might have occurred regardless of the referendum, it opened an additional front in the virtual battlefield that these elections have become. Reports suggest that up to 150 million euro ($162.9 million) was allocated for social media campaigns aimed at spreading disinformation, interfering with the elections, and destabilizing the country. Additionally, investigative journalists from Ziarul de Garda uncovered that Ilan Shor &#x2013; an Israeli-born Moldovan pro-Russian oligarch and politician &#x2013; funded around 15 million euro ($16.3 million) to directly buy votes from his exile in Russia. This is a staggering sum for a country of just 2.5 million inhabitants. Moscow&#x2019;s nervousness was palpable, especially among pro-European citizens in Chisinau in the days leading up to the vote. The extremely close results, with only a small majority in favor of the referendum, have proved their concerns valid. A negative outcome would not necessarily halt the EU accession process, as the question only aims to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. This change would make it more difficult for future governments to deviate from that path, but it would not render it impossible. However, as mentioned, this approach severely limited the space for discourse. There was no option to support the referendum without also supporting Sandu. The second-place candidate came from the Party of Socialists, which called for a boycott of the referendum. Their deputies also left parliament when, in March, the ruling PAS government majority endorsed a resoluti0on to continue efforts to join the EU. People cast their ballots during the 2024 Moldovan presidential election and the referendum on rapprochement with the European Union at a polling station in Hirbovat, Moldova, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Daniel Mihaliescu /AFP via Getty Images)Instead of engaging in an honest debate about the challenges and opportunities of Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration, as well as the achievements and failures of Sandu&#x2019;s presidency, voters faced a binary choice &#x2013; right or wrong &#x2013; depending on their perspectives. The only option was to counter the blatant propaganda from the pro-Russian side, such as the claim &#x2013; echoed by some EU member states and government &#x2013; that EU membership would embroil Moldova in the war the Kremlin is waging against Ukraine. What could have been discussed is that Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament approved a similar constitutional change in 2019, which may have heightened anxieties for some. A pertinent discussion should involve how Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), or the mutual defense clause, could be interpreted or guaranteed without NATO in a potential EU membership for Ukraine and/or Moldova. Beyond listing the usual advantages of EU membership (such as basic freedoms, no roaming fees, and flight rights), there is a notable lack of positive narratives addressing the fears and concerns of both Moldovans and EU citizens. It may help to put certain matters into perspective. Enlargement would return us to where we once were. The six Western Balkan countries, along with Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, have a combined population of approximately 67 million &#x2013; similar to the U.K. Admittedly, these nine candidate countries have only 10% of the U.K.&apos;s GDP, but enlargement represents an opportunity for stabilizing democracies, as it has in most previous rounds of enlargement. A stable neighborhood has historically led to economic prosperity for both old and new EU members. We should stop focusing solely on the budget (which, at around 142.5 billion euro ($154.6 million), is only about 20 billion euro ($21.7 billion) higher than Austria&#x2019;s). It is evident that not everyone can receive more than they contribute. However, the net payer concept is misleading; for instance, Germany contributes 27% more than France to the EU but benefits 67% more from single market integration. While additional countries in the EU may complicate decision-making, more than 60% of votes since 2010 have been unanimous, even though qualified majority voting (QMV) would have sufficed, according to the German think tank SWP. They have suggested extending QMV without a treaty revision, but perhaps that should only be Plan B. Why not be bold and reintegrate deepening and widening? The complicated journey from the Treaty of Nice to Lisbon &#x2013; including the aforementioned negative referenda in 2005 and an additional one in 2008 &#x2013; took 65 months. The longest successful enlargement negotiations took 77 months, averaging 42.4 months. Therefore, the goal of EU membership for Moldova by 2030, as announced by the government, is achievable with the right ambition and determination from all parties involved. Typically, a referendum on EU membership occurs at the end of this process, not at the beginning. Perhaps there will be more room for discussion leading up to the second round of presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 3, now that referendum anxiety has lessened, albeit by a narrow margin. Ultimately, the real &quot;referendum&quot; will be the parliamentary elections, set to take place by July 2025 at the latest. It is not the president but the government that will determine Moldova&apos;s direction. Until then, there will be plenty of room for anxiety on all sides &#x2013; but there is also still hope for Moldova&apos;s future within the EU.

Ukraine war latest: US announces new defense aid package for Ukraine worth $400 million	Key developments on Oct. 21: The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. Later in the day, the Pentagon said in its press release that the recent package included HIMARS air defense systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, M113 armored personnel carriers, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, and ammunition for high-mobility artillery. Washington also pledged to provide Kyiv with 155 mm and 105 mm artillery ammunition, as well as 60 mm, 81 mm, and 120 mm mortar systems and rounds, among other weapons and training equipment. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter. Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Suspilne earlier reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials, that eighteen North Korean soldiers had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border. Hromadske also reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Korean soldiers that were detained had been left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandon their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system overnight on Oct. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The operation was reportedly carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces together with other military units. The Buk-M3 is the latest version of the Soviet-era Buk systems family. It is a medium-range system that can intercept aerial targets, including tactical ballistic missiles, at a range of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Russian anti-aircraft system was located around 60 kilometers from the front line, the General Staff said. The cost of such equipment is estimated at $40-50 million. The statement did not specify the exact location of the targeted system. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 979 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-defense-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-400-million/	2024-10-21T10:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169770970.jpg
Alexei Navalny's widow Yulia says she will run for president if she can return to Russia	Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, told the BBC in an interview she would run for president if she is able to return to a post-Putin Russia. &#x201C;I will participate in the elections&#x2026; as a candidate&#x201D; when the time is right, Navalnaya told the BBC in an interview published on Oct. 21. Navalnaya said that she aims to &quot;bring closer and make change in the country possible&quot; without going into further details, but added that she is not &quot;a magician and does not know the secret&quot; of bringing about immediate change in Russia. &quot;If you can&apos;t do something big right away, do something small every day, and the more people do that, the sooner it will be time for change,&quot; she said. Navalnaya said her return to Moscow is &quot;unfortunately impossible&quot; as long as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in office. She currently lives abroad and did not attend the funeral of her husband, Alexei, which took place on March 3, in fear of being arrested. In July, a court in Moscow ordered the arrest in absentia of Navalnaya on charges of &quot;participating in an extremist organization.&quot; The charges mean that if she were to return to Russia she would face jail time, similar to her late husband. Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in 2021 after being hospitalized in Germany following an attempt on his life, and was immediately detained. He died in on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in Russia after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Putin for his death. Following the death of her husband, Navalnaya entered more into the public spotlight. She has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s work. Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot,&quot; compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and edited in part by his widow, Yuliya, will be published posthumously on Oct. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnaya-wants-to-participate-in-russias-presidential-election-if-she-returns-to-country/	2024-10-21T09:04:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147917825.jpg
Unprecedented interference' by Russia, its proxies in Moldova referendum, EU says	Moldova&apos;s referendum on joining the EU, which took place alongside elections in the country, occurred under &quot;unprecedented interference&quot; by Russia and its proxies, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said. &quot;This vote took place under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes in the Republic of Moldova,&quot; Stano said on Oct. 21 during a press briefing in Brussels. Voters were almost evenly divided on Oct. 21 on a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution. Preliminary results show that the pro-EU voters won by a razor-thin margin, securing 50.42% of the vote against 49.58% who voted &quot;no,&quot; the country&apos;s electoral commission said. In the presidential elections, Moldovan President Maia Sandu came first in the initial round of the election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Pro-EU Sandu will face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a member of the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, who gained roughly 26% of the vote in the first round. Stano said that the EU is following the referendum and the presidential election in Moldova and will provide an &quot;official reaction&quot; once the final results of both votes are announced. The spokesperson added that attempts to disrupt the voting in Moldova lasted &quot;not weeks but months,&quot; long before Oct. 20. Stano also mentioned vote-buying and propaganda spreading efforts made by Russia and its proxies. &quot;This is an ongoing effort from Russia and its proxies &#x2014; not only in Moldova, indeed, also against our countries &#x2014; and it&apos;s a long-term fight. They don&apos;t have boundaries. We, as the European Union... respect certain principles, including the laws, but Russia and its actors and its proxies do not respect that,&quot; he said. Moldovan authorities have claimed that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans voters who have been instructed on how to cast their ballots in the election. Pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network despite his own political party being banned. Sandu, a pro-Western politician, has also previously accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow her government in an attempted coup. The U.S., U.K., and Canada warned of potential Russian interference in Moldova&apos;s elections in a joint statement issued on June 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/voting-in-moldova-takes-place-under-unprecedented-interference-by-russia-its-proxies-european-commission-spokesperson-says/	2024-10-21T07:52:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1205267788.jpeg
Sending North Korean troops to fight Russia's war would mean 'significant escalation,' Rutte says	The involvement of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine would be a &quot;significant escalation,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 21 after talks with the South Korean president. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. &quot;North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&quot; Rutte said on social media following a conversation with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, without explicitly confirming the reports. The two discussed NATO&#x2019;s close partnership with Seoul, defense industrial cooperation, and the interconnected security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. &quot;Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&quot; Yoon said, according to the Yonhap news agency. &quot;This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the (South Korean) government will never stand by and let this happen.&quot; While the United States is cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-south-korean-president-north-korea/	2024-10-21T05:40:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179187617.jpg
Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia kills 2, injures 15	A Russian strike against the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 21 killed two people and injured 15, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. At least three of the injured are in serious condition. Some 30 buildings were damaged after Russia struck the residential area of the city early on Oct. 21. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. Fedorov did not say what weaponry Russia used in the attack but reported ballistic missile warnings several times during the day. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-against-zaporizhzhia-kills-2-injures-15/	2024-10-21T05:29:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zaporizhzhia-Oct-21.jpg
US announces $400 million defense aid package for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. The exact content of the latest aid package is not immediately clear, but Austin said it would include ammunition, military equipment, and weapons. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-400-million-package/	2024-10-21T05:11:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157421608.jpg
Ex-military logistics chief named new head of Ukroboronprom state defense company	Oleh Huliak, who has been acting CEO of the state-owned enterprise Ukrainian Defense Industry (Ukroboronprom), was officially appointed to the job on Oct. 21, the company announced. Huliak replaced Herman Smetanin, who was appointed the strategic industries minister as part of the biggest wartime government reshuffle in September, replacing Alexander Kamyshin. Smetanin had been in charge of Ukroporonprom since June 2023 after his predecessor, Yurii Husiev, was reportedly dismissed for the company&#x2019;s poor performance under his watch. Ukrainska Pravda reported last June that the main problem for Ukroboronprom under Husiev&#x2019;s leadership was the poor progress in a missile program. The Supervisory Board of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned defense production conglomerate selected Huliak among 20 candidates for the position. Representatives of the U.S., U.K., and German embassies were involved in the interviews with the shortlisted nominees. Smetanin outlined Huliak&apos;s main tasks, such as increasing production volumes, building an effective anti-corruption infrastructure, and completing the reform of Ukraine&apos;s defense sector. &quot;Oleh Huliak is well aware of the immediate needs of the army, he is an experienced leader,&quot; Smetanin added. Before his appointment to Ukroboronprom, Huliak served as the commander of the Logistics Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces since 2021. He started his military career in the 1990s and later held top positions, serving as commander of several Ukrainian brigades. A decorated major general, Huliak headed the Odesa Military Academy from 2012 to 2021. Ukroboronprom is a leading strategic manufacturer of weapons and military hardware in Ukraine. The association includes enterprises that develop, manufacture, sell, repair, and modernize weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. Since the all-out war started, the company has relocated much of its production abroad and reduced its activities across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/oleh-huliak-named-new-head-of-ukroboronprom/	2024-10-21T05:02:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-134439.png

Ukraine's 46th brigade releases video of repelled Russian attack near Kurakhove	Ukraine&apos;s 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Oct. 20 that it had repelled a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukrainian troops fended off 59 attacks in the Kurakhove sector over the past day alone, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Oct. 21. Russian forces tried to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines and capture the village of Maksymilianivka to create conditions for further advance toward Kurakhove, the 46th brigade said. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Oct. 20, 2024, showing Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector. (The 46th Airmobile Brigade/Facebook)The unsuccessful attack reportedly involved seven tanks and 11 infantry fighting vehicles, with Ukrainian forces destroying seven pieces of Russian equipment. &quot;Two more damaged tanks managed to roll back,&quot; the brigade said. The fate of the 28 fleeing Russian soldiers is unknown, the unit added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/46th-brigade-kurakhove/	2024-10-21T03:41:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-130947.png
Kremlin calls North Korean troops reports 'contradictory' but stops short of denial	The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. Kyiv and Seoul accused Pyongyang of preparing to send more than 10,000 military personnel to assist Russia, adding that some troops had already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; The reported transfer of North Korean military personnel comes as the most significant step by Pyongyang in support of Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. North Korea has previously provided Russia with extensive arms packages, including artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/peskov-north-korea/	2024-10-21T03:34:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg

Russia attacking toward town near Pokrovsk, National Guard says	Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The estimated advance of Russian forces near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 20, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/national-guard-selydove/	2024-10-21T02:34:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569068.jpg
Seoul summons Russian envoy over North Korean troops' deployment	South Korea on Oct. 21 summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, to protest the dispatch of North Korean troops to assist Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported. Seoul and Kyiv accused North Korea of preparing to transfer between 10,000 and 12,000 military personnel to Russia in a sign of deepening military cooperation between the two countries. Some North Korean troops had reportedly already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine to share experiences with their Russian counterparts. South Korea&apos;s First Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun summoned Zinoviev to call for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with North Korea, Yonhap wrote, citing the South Korean Foreign Ministry. The South Korean diplomat &quot;condemned in the strongest terms the illegal military cooperation, including... (North Korea&apos;s) troop deployment, and sternly warned that South Korea will respond with every possible means, with the international community, to any acts that threaten the core interests of South Korea.&quot; South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. It would mark the first time North Korean forces had been deployed to a foreign war. It remains unclear what steps Seoul is planning to take. Yonhap reported in June that South Korea is mulling openly providing arms supplies to Ukraine in response to deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The Kremlin has previously denied the reports of North Korean troop dispatch as fake news. The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and urged immediate action.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-summons-russian-envoy-over-north-korean-troops-deployment/	2024-10-21T02:14:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-672536428.jpg
UN's nuclear agency funded Russian research in occupied Crimea, RFE/RL reports	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has financed Russian state scientific research in occupied Crimea since the peninsula was illegally captured in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Oct. 21, citing obtained documents. According to the agency&apos;s internal documents, the IAEA signed at least two agreements with Russian research institutes to conduct research that included fieldwork in Crimea. The deals were signed between 2016 and 2019, and the first was reportedly extended in the summer of 2019. The outlet described the projects as limited in size and scope. The IAEA has repeatedly publicly declared its commitment to Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, urging Russia to withdraw from Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, which has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. In a statement to RFE/RL, the IAEA said that the agency continues to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. It described its studies on the occupied territory as being of a &quot;purely technical nature&quot; and said they &quot;do not constitute any change in the agency&apos;s position on the status of Crimea.&quot; The IAEA representative also called the counterpart of one of the projects, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), an international research center based in Moscow Oblast, &quot;not a Russian organization but an International Intergovernmental Scientific Research Organization located in Russia.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s permanent diplomatic mission in Vienna, where the IAEA is headquartered, told RFE/RL that none of the IAEA&apos;s research projects in Crimea have been approved by the Ukrainian government. Previously, Ukrainian authorities criticized the agency for &quot;the ambivalent position&quot; and &quot;the retransmission of Russian propaganda.&quot; Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), visited both Kyiv and Moscow since the start of the all-out war as well as the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Monitoring teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been based at the facility on rotation since September 2022, but Russian authorities still deny IAEA inspectors full access to the plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-crimea/	2024-10-21T01:53:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2056052044.jpg
The Counteroffensive: An inside look at the virtual reality therapy reshaping veterans' rehabilitation	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Oct. 17, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Last year, Mykola Horishnyi was declared clinically dead &#x2013; twice. The Ukrainian soldier suffered severe blood loss from an explosion, likely a Russian mine. &#x201C;Tomorrow will mark exactly one year since I was wounded &#x2013; at 4:45 p.m. I still can&apos;t fully grasp that this all happened to me and that I am no longer in the trenches,&#x201D; Mykola told The Counteroffensive. Mykola suffers from PTSD, making it difficult for him to discuss the traumatic events he endured. He recently began psychotherapy at a rehabilitation center in the Kyiv suburb of Borodianka, which is pioneering unique virtual reality therapy. Ukraine&apos;s Health Ministry reported in August that the number of people struggling with mental health issues has doubled since 2023. Market research data shows that sales of antidepressants have grown by more than 50% compared to the pre-war year of 2021, according to the BBC. Typically, around 15% of people develop PTSD after experiencing traumatic events of violent conflict or war. Most can overcome its effects with the right professional help, though traditional therapy doesn&apos;t always succeed. The increase in mental health problems suggests a major social crisis after the war, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers try to reintegrate into peacetime civilian life. To address these challenges, technological innovators are experimenting with new forms of virtual reality (VR) therapy. &#x201C;If it wasn&apos;t for our doctors, we wouldn&apos;t be talking now,&#x201D; Mykola said. For Mykola, it all began when he volunteered to join the army in February 2023. &#x201C;I wanted to be deployed to the front lines in the east, to get to Crimea, take our Crimea back, and that&#x2019;s it. But of course, it didn&apos;t work out as expected,&quot; he said. A year has passed since Mykola was injured, but he is still haunted by the memories. &#x201C;I still can&#x2019;t fully comprehend that this is my reality now, that I&#x2019;m no longer in the trenches, running around, storming positions. When I close my eyes or sit alone, I feel like I&#x2019;m still there. I see the trenches in my sleep &#x2013; these nightmares never leave me,&#x201D; Mykola said. Currently, Mykola is receiving therapy and retreat services at the Borodianka Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation. The center is one of the few places in Ukraine actively developing VR therapy. Exposure therapy using VR has shown promising therapeutic qualities. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to think of many mental health conditions that it couldn&#x2019;t benefit. We are working on treatments for a large number of conditions,&#x201D; Daniel Freeman, a professor at the University of Oxford, told the BBC. A Ukrainian soldier undergoes a speleotherapy session at a rehabilitation center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 4, 2023. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)A specialist is always present to provide support, but the main goal is to recreate traumatic memories to help the patient overcome stress and fear. &#x201C;Our brains are built in a way that they don&#x2019;t really tell the difference between virtual and physical reality. Virtual reality helps bring a person back to normal memories and feelings by immersing them in a virtual environment,&#x201D; said Yevhen Kotukh, a Ukrainian VR specialist who is actively developing this technology. Yevhen and his team are working on creating a new technology for the rapid diagnosis of PTSD. They plan to use virtual reality to evoke emotional responses in veterans by showing a two-minute simulation of combat operations. Signals from the brain can then help determine whether the person has PTSD. Currently, the VR technology at the center is in the early stages of development, but the team is actively collaborating with donors and partners to improve it. It is expected that standard treatment will require up to ten sessions of 50 minutes each, taking place weekly. When the course is finished, a person&apos;s sensitivity to stress should decrease to a manageable level. Ultimately, VR therapy can help more than two-thirds of people with PTSD when used alongside a psychologist. Traditional exposure therapy &#x2013;where the therapist creates a safe environment and exposes the patient to their fears &#x2013; may not be suitable for everyone and has its limitations. First, it takes time to engage the soldier and begin addressing traumatic events. Second, the veteran&#x2019;s memory and imagination might not be sufficient to process the trauma. Additionally, it can be hard for individuals to open up and speak freely about painful memories. Currently, active cooperation with foreign partners is underway to create a specialized room with sensors that allow for free movement, enhancing the realism of the VR experience. In addition to psychological assistance, VR helps with phantom pain for those who have lost limbs but can still feel pain in the amputated areas. Mykyta Makazan, a veteran who had his leg amputated, faced this problem. He shared that sometimes the pain was so intense it made it difficult to get out of bed. With sensors attached to the muscles of his lost limb and virtual reality games designed to develop motor skills, he can rewire his brain to believe that the limb he moves in the game is his own. This approach helps him move the muscles and stretch them, alleviating the phantom pain. The goal of virtual reality therapy is to relieve the pain experienced in reality. As Mykola discussed the nightmares that still haunt him, his smile faded. To shift the conversation, I asked about things that distract him, and he smiled. &#x201C;Family. Home, routine, communication &#x2013; when my wife comes home from work and we talk, when we go for a walk, this center in Borodianka,&#x201D; Mykola said. All veterans should experience such support and assistance on their difficult paths toward physical and psychological rehabilitation.

Russia detains 18 North Korean soldiers who left positions in Kursk Oblast, source says	Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Eighteen of them had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, Suspilne reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials. Hromadske reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Koreans were left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandoning their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/18-north-korean-soldier-detained/	2024-10-21T01:17:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Update: Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 29 over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The article was updated with the latest casualty figures in Zaporizhzhia. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 28 over the past day, including a child, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 21. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 59 of the 116 Shahed-type attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Forty-five drones were reportedly &quot;lost&quot; on Ukrainian territory, and 10 more were still present in the Ukrainian airspace at the time of the publication. Russia also attacked Ukraine with an Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missile, one Kh-35 guided aerial missile, and one Kh-31P guided aerial missile. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv overnight, all of which were reportedly destroyed. One man was injured, suffering burns to his face, the city authorities said. A Russian missile attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late on Oct. 20 injured four people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The victims included a 12-year-old girl, a 22-year-old man, and two women aged 63 and 36. A hotel, five multi-story buildings, a cultural facility, a bank, two shops, and 14 cars were damaged. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three residents in Novoselydivka, Kurakhove, and Illinka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 20 injured at least 13 people, the State Emergency Service said. Earlier the same day, a 71-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman were found dead under the rubble following a Russian attack against the village of Novoplatonivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast injured two people, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two high-rise buildings, 23 houses, a farm building, and cars were damaged. Russia launched drone strikes against the Shalyhyne community in Sumy Oblast on Oct. 20, killing a resident, regional authorities reported. Overnight attacks against the region hit a critical infrastructure facility, leading to blackouts in several settlements. Six people were injured and several houses damaged in a Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 21, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Poltava, and Kirovohrad oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-100/	2024-10-21T00:35:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kharkiv-Oct-21.jpg
Russia's Black Sea Fleet forced to redeploy over Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian proxy admits	Russia has redeployed vessels of its Black Sea Fleet due to attacks by Ukrainian naval drones, Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian proxy head of occupation authorities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said in an interview with Kremlin-controlled Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper published on Oct. 21. Rogozin&apos;s surprise admission is in line with previous statements made by Ukrainian officials. Successful Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea forced Moscow to pull out much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian city of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, which became a key port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. According to Rogozin, a &quot;military-technical revolution&quot; took place during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, impacting the usefulness of traditional weapons systems. He referred to the Russian Black Sea Fleet as a weapon system that had undergone changes during the war. &quot;It (Black Sea Fleet) was forced... to change its residence because our large ships became targets for the enemy&apos;s unmanned boats,&quot; Rogozin said. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/black-sea-fleet-changes-its-residence-due-to-ukrainian-drone-attacks-russian-official-says/	2024-10-21T00:22:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240487588.jpg
Russian high-ranking pilot found dead in Bryansk Oblast, military intelligence says	Russian pilot Dmitry Golenkov, who participated in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, was found dead in the town of Suponevo in Bryansk Oblast on Oct. 20, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. According to the agency, Golenkov suffered multiple head injuries, probably caused by a hammer. HUR published photos purporting to show Golenkov&apos;s body in an apple orchard, without claiming responsibility for the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Golenkov served as chief of staff of a Russian aviation squadron. He was a pilot of the 52nd Heavy Bomber Regiment of the Russian Air Force, which is based at the Shaykovka airfield and hosts Tu-22M3 bombers. Russia uses these aircraft to carry out missile attacks against Ukraine. Golenkov was involved in missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian targets, HUR said, including the Amstor shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast in June 2022. According to authorities, more than 1,000 people were inside the building at the moment of the attack. Twenty-two people were killed, and dozens were injured. Golenkov was also reportedly responsible for an attack on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro in January 2023. It was one of the deadliest single Russian attacks on Ukraine, killing 46 people, including six children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-pilot-found-dead/	2024-10-20T23:17:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-664707660.jpg
US Defense Secretary Austin arrives in Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 21 as Ukraine hopes to secure further support ahead of the uncertain U.S. election, CNN reported. Austin&apos;s visit comes only a few days after U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Berlin to meet the leaders of the U.K., Germany, and France to discuss continued support for Ukraine and Kyiv&apos;s five-step victory plan. The U.S. defense chief is expected to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, to discuss Ukraine&apos;s battlefield needs. The visit will also serve as a chance to &quot;step back&quot; and assess the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship over the course of the full-scale war, CNN reported. Ukraine is finding itself in an increasingly difficult position. Despite Washington&apos;s support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/austin-arrives-in-kyiv/	2024-10-20T22:54:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-12-23.21.02.jpeg

Navalny's prison diaries to be published posthumously this week	Alexei Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot&quot; will be published posthumously on Oct. 22. The memoir is compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and was edited in part by his widow, Yulia Navalnaya. The book will be released in 22 languages, including Russian. Navalny died on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in northern Russia, after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his death. In &quot;Patriot,&quot; Navalny wrote that he expected to die in prison. &quot;I knew from the outset that I would be imprisoned for life &#x2014; either the rest of my life or until the end of the life of this regime,&quot; he wrote in a March 2022 diary entry. &quot;I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here.&quot; Navalnaya has said she hopes the memoir ensures that her husband won&apos;t be forgotten and that his political activism continues to inspire the Russian opposition movement. &quot;I want his voice to be heard loudly even after his death,&quot; she told the BBC&apos;s Russia service in an interview ahead of the book&apos;s release. Navalnaya has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s political work. A Moscow court ordered her arrest in absentia in July, charging her with &quot;participating in an extremist organization&quot; due to her involvement with the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization founded by her late husband. Navalnaya would &quot;go to the elections as a presidential candidate&quot; if she ever returned to Russia, she told the BBC. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny&apos;s death.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnys-prison-diaries-to-be-published-posthumously-this-week/	2024-10-20T19:22:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2008366667.jpg
Ukraine's new 'Sting' drone designed to hunt Shaheds, Telegraph reports	Ukraine is developing a new drone that can track and intercept Shahed-type attack drones, the Telegraph reported on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Kyiv&apos;s new weapon, named &quot;Sting,&quot; is a first-person-view (FPV) drone that can chase and neutralize Shahed drones in lieu of conventional air defense systems, the Telegraph reported. According to the drone&apos;s developers, the Wild Hornets group, &quot;Sting&quot; will be able to fly at altitudes approaching 10,000 feet, with a speed of over 100 miles per hour. The weapon will be operated from the ground using VR goggles. It is the first drone specifically developed to target Russia&apos;s arsenal of Shaheds. &quot;Its average cost is dozens of times lower than that of the Shahed drone,&quot; a Wild Hornet source told the Telegraph regarding the Sting drone. The lower production costs may allow Ukraine to conserve its air defense munitions over the coming months, as Russia intensifies aerial attacks targeting Ukrainian cities and the nation&apos;s energy grid. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 20 that Russia has launched a total of 6,230 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine since the beginning of the year. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing modern warfare. Multiple videos have shown how Ukrainian FPV drones hit Russian reconnaissance drones and other costly equipment on the battlefield. Ukraine in September established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to drone warfare. Kyiv said it aims to produce 1 million drones this year, in addition to the thousands pledged by foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-sting-drone-designed-to-hunt-shaheds-telegraph-reports/	2024-10-20T17:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Sandu leads in 1st round of Moldovan elections, voters reject EU referendum	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Moldovan President Maia Sandu led the first round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with nearly 39 percent of the vote, the Moldovan election commission announced. The preliminary results are based on over 93 percent of the tallied votes. If no candidate wins a majority, a second round of voting will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu will likely face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who captured approximately 28 percent of the vote in the first round. Moldovan voters also rejected enshrining the country&apos;s path to European Union accession, with over 52 percent voting against the amendment in a referendum held alongside the presidential election. The election results have been tainted by allegations of Russian interference, with Moldovan lawmakers claiming that Moscow spent millions of dollars in a campaign to unseat Sandu and vote down the EU referendum. Tensions between Moscow and Chisinau have been mounting since February 2022 amid fears that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine may spill into Moldova via Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway territory occupied by Russian troops since 1991. The pro-Western incumbent, Maia Sandu, has previously accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow her government in an attempted coup. &#xA0; Throughout the current election, allegations of Russian meddling continuously surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. The Kremlin&apos;s efforts are part of a broader attempt to undermine Moldova&apos;s pro-Western leadership in the country. Moldovan authorities have said that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote in the upcoming election. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Moldova&apos;s state-owned broadcaster reported on Sept. 28 that vandals had splashed paint across the entrance of its building in the capital city of Chisinau. This incident occurred a day after police attributed similar acts to a group trained in Moscow with the aim of destabilizing the elections. The U.S., U.K., and Canada warned of potential Russian interference in Moldova&apos;s elections in a joint statement issued on June 13. &#xA0; &quot;If Russia&apos;s election meddling proves unsuccessful in Moldova, there is reason to believe Moscow will work to incite protests,&quot; the statement said. Shortly after the warning, Sanda approved changes to the country&apos;s treason laws, allowing some wartime treason laws to apply to peacetime, as well as extending punishments and creating a new category of laws for assisting a foreign state. Moldova launched EU accession talks in Luxembourg on June 25, the same day that Ukraine began its long-awaited membership negotiations. The Oct. 20 referendum, if passed, would have amended Moldova&apos;s constitution to formally include the country&apos;s accession to the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandu-leads-first-round-moldova-elections/	2024-10-20T16:18:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178740400.jpg
Russian missile attack in Kharkiv injures 9	A Russian missile attack targeting Kharkiv the evening of Oct. 20 injured nine civilians, the Kharkiv Oblast police reported. The wounded include four women aged 22 to 53 and five men aged 21 to 37, according to regional authorities. Russian missiles targeted three districts in the city of Kharkiv at around 10 p.m. local time, police reported. Some areas of the city lost electricity due to the attack. The strike also damaged apartment buildings, houses, garages, gas stations, and cars. Emergency workers have been dispatched to all attack sites and the full consequences of the missile strike are currently under investigation. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-in-kharkiv-injures-9/	2024-10-20T14:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Russia has launched over 6,100 attack drones at Ukraine since start of 2024, Zelensky says	Russia has launched a total of 6,130 Shahed-type drones since the start of 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. In recent weeks, Russia has stepped up its drone attacks &#x2014; for the first time since the full-scale invasion, they targeted cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis since the start of September. On Aug. 26, Russia launched its largest attack on Ukraine so far with 127 missiles and 109 drones, while Ukraine downed 102 missiles and 99 drones, according to the Air Force. Russian strikes hit several civilian, energy, and fuel facilities, including a dam in Kyiv, part of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant. Recently, Russia appears to have switched tactics to use more drones in its attacks, with the country utilizing 129 Shahed-type drones in its attack earlier this week on Oct. 18, Zelensky said. In his evening address, Zelensky criticized &quot;the free world&apos;s indecision&quot; in delaying the provision of additional defense systems. &quot;There needs to be more pressure on Russia&apos;s ability to already produce these weapons. We need the capability to destroy not only the storage bases for the &apos;Shaheds&apos; but also the entire infrastructure for their production and logistics.&quot; On Oct. 9, Ukraine&apos;s military struck a base storing 400 Iranian Shahed-type drones near the village of Oktyabrsky in Russia&apos;s Kranodar Krai. While initially sourcing Shahed-type drones from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-launched-over-6-100-attack-drones-at-ukraine-since-start-of-2024-zelensky-says/	2024-10-20T13:23:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1982613220-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine says it struck airfield and 'largest explosives factory' in Russia	Key developments on Oct. 19-20: Ukraine said on Oct. 20 that it attacked Russia&apos;s &quot;largest explosives plant&quot; and an airfield overnight, the latest in a series of long-range drone attacks in the rear to slowly grind down the bigger foe&apos;s powerful war machine from afar. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the drones targeted the large state-owned Sverdlov Plant in the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 900 kilometers deep into Russia. The plant has been under sanctions by the U.S. and the EU since 2023, over what the U.S. State Department says is its work &quot;acquiring goods in support of Russia&apos;s war effort.&quot; The factory produces explosives, industrial chemicals, detonators and ammunition, the U.S. said in a press release when the sanctions were announced. The source told the Kyiv Independent that the plant produces aviation and artillery shells, aviation bombs, and warheads that help Russia continue waging its war against Ukraine. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported later in the day that Ukraine had also struck the Lipetsk-2 airfield in the Lipetsk region, located over 400 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. This attack targeted ammunition depots, fuel storage facilities and aircraft on an airfield known to be home to Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft, it added. The operations were carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, the SBU source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. &quot;The SBU worked on strengthening the sanctions against the Sverdlov plant,&quot; the SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We added drones to the economic sanctions, which give an instant effect. Work on reducing the enemy&apos;s military capabilities will continue.&quot; Earlier in October, another Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. In September, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions. A Russian overnight missile strike on the central-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih injured 17 people, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, reported on Oct. 20. Russian troops struck the city, located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, twice with ballistic missiles, according to Vilkul. Eight of the injured are currently in the hospital, but their conditions are &quot;moderate,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Vilkul said that Russia targeted &quot;peaceful civilian sites,&quot; damaging 15 buildings, three educational institutions, three administrative buildings, seven businesses, a hotel, three fire trucks, and 20 cars. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, has regularly faced missile attacks, as it is located not far from the front line. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election scheduled for Oct. 26. The &quot;Georgia Chooses the European Union&quot; march brought what appeared to be several tens of thousand of protesters to the streets of the Tbilisi, social media videos show. Protesters waved EU and Georgian flag while singing the country&apos;s national anthem. President Salome Zourabichvili, a vocal opponent of the ruling Georgian Dream party, participated in the rally, urging protesters to vote for pro-European parties during the election. Zourabichvili said the protest &quot;shows that Georgia has already won and will reintegrate with Europe.&quot; Zourabichvili also addressed President Volodymyr Zelensky in her speech, stating that Ukraine is &#xA0;&quot;fighting for Georgia as well. You will be victorious and we will enter the European Union together.&quot; Ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in Georgia, massive pro- EU march is underway in #Tbilisi. #GeVote2024 pic.twitter.com/VyLPUnX2vy Georgia&apos;s received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023. Although questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-38/	2024-10-20T11:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245598723.jpg

Belarus downs Russian drone over its airspace, monitoring group says	The Belarusian Air Force downed a Russian Shahed-type drone over the country&apos;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. The incident marks just the third time a Belarusian aircraft has downed a drone that entered its airspace. According to the monitoring group, three Russian attack drones entered Belarus&apos; southern territory beginning around 12:30 a.m. local time. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk in Homel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones that Russia launched overnight. The Air Force added that 13 drones were lost from Ukraine&apos;s radar overnight. In early September, Belarus&apos; military confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on for the first time since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2013; its key ally &#x2013; over the reported drone incidents. According to Belarusian Hajun, there have been multiple cases of Russian Shahed-type drones flying off course to Belarus over the past few months as drone attacks intensify.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-downs-russian-drone-over-its-airspace-monitoring-group-says/	2024-10-20T08:47:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg
Ukrainian drones struck 'largest explosives factory' in Russia, source says	Ukrainian drones struck Russia&apos;s &quot;largest explosives plant&quot; overnight, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 20. The source said the drones targeted the large state-owned Sverdlov Plant in the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 900 kilometers deep into Russia. The plant has been under sanctions by the U.S. and the EU since 2023, over what the U.S. State Department says is its work &quot;acquiring goods in support of Russia&apos;s war effort.&quot; The factory produces explosives, industrial chemicals, detonators and ammunition, the U.S. said in a press release when the sanctions were announced. The source told the Kyiv Independent that the plant produces aviation and artillery shells, aviation bombs, and warheads that help Russia continue waging its war against Ukraine. The operation was carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. &quot;The SBU worked on strengthening the sanctions against the Sverdlov plant,&quot; the SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We added drones to the economic sanctions, which give an instant effect. Work on reducing the enemy&apos;s military capabilities will continue.&quot; Earlier in October, another Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. In September, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-struck-largest-factory-for-explosives-in-russia-source-says/	2024-10-20T03:04:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245598723.jpg
Russian overnight missile strike on Kryvyi Rih injures 17	A Russian overnight missile strike on the central-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih injured 17 people, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, reported on Oct. 20. Russian troops struck the city, located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, twice with ballistic missiles, according to Vilkul. Eight of the injured are currently in the hospital, but their conditions are &quot;moderate,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. &#xA0; Vilkul said that Russia targeted &quot;peaceful civilian sites,&quot; damaging 15 buildings, three educational institutions, three administrative buildings, seven businesses, a hotel, three fire trucks, and 20 cars. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, has regularly faced missile attacks, as it is located not far from the front line. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-overnight-missile-strike-on-kryvyi-rih-wounds-17/	2024-10-20T01:41:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1665966342.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 677,180 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 678,520 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 20. This number includes 1,340 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,035 tanks, 18,072 armored fighting vehicles, 26,987 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,565 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,287 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-677-180-troops-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2024-10-19T23:33:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150597901.jpg
Moldova votes in election, EU referendum amid alleged Russian interference	Moldova&apos;s upcoming presidential election and EU referendum on Oct. 20 are seen as critical in determining its future direction toward European Union integration. Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu is leading in the polls, but if she doesn&apos;t reach the 50% threshold, a runoff will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu also hopes for a strong &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum to solidify EU accession as a constitutional goal. Allegations of Russian meddling have recently surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. Over $15 million in Russian funds have been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Despite these developments, police are confident that any interference will not significantly affect the election outcome.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-votes-in-election-eu-referendum-amid-alleged-russian-interference/	2024-10-19T21:26:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg
Russia's attack on Sumy Oblast's town kills 1, injures 11	Russian forces launched an attack on Shostka, a town in Sumy Oblast, overnight on Oct. 19 using guided bombs and drones, regional authorities reported. One civilian was killed, and 11 others were injured in the attack, according to Mykola Noha, mayor of Shostka. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. The mayor reported that several critical infrastructure facilities, including two schools, a kindergarten, multiple medical institutions, and 28 apartment buildings, were damaged in Shostka. Most residents in the area were left without electricity and water. Emergency crews were dispatched to the site of the attacks and conducted repairs, and rubble clearance was almost complete as of 8 p.m. local time on Oct. 19. Shostka, with its pre-war population of approximately 72,000, is located 180 kilometers northwest of the regional capital, Sumy. In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs near the border areas of Sumy Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attack-on-sumy-oblasts-town-kills-1-injures-11/	2024-10-19T18:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168180900.jpg
Russian victory would bring 'chaos,' French FM says	French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned during a visit to Kyiv on Oct. 19 that a Russian victory over Ukraine would bring &quot;chaos&quot; to the international system. Barrot&apos;s comments came as Russian forces continued their offensive in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, including the capture of the key town of Vuhledar in early October. Barrot&apos;s visit was intended to reaffirm France&apos;s strong support for Ukraine following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s unveiling of his victory plan to defeat Russia. The plan includes a call for increased Western military support. &quot;A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,&quot; Barrot said, standing alongside his counterpart Andrii Sybiha. When asked if Paris supported Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, Barrot confirmed, &quot;We support the victory plan because we have been alongside Ukraine for nearly 1,000 days.&quot; However, in the rest of his remarks, Barrot referred more generally to a &quot;peace plan&quot; as the way to end the war without specifying an official position on Zelensky&apos;s detailed proposals, Agence France-Presse reported. Like other Western allies, Paris is still reviewing the plan&apos;s specifics. After meeting with Barrot, Zelensky expressed gratitude to France, saying the support for the victory plan could &quot;bring real diplomacy and a just peace closer.&quot; He described their meeting as &quot;exactly what we needed&quot; during his evening address. The core of Zelensky&apos;s plan includes an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, a position that Barrot said Paris is &quot;open&quot; to discussing with other alliance members. The plan also rejects territorial concessions and urges allies to lift restrictions on using long-range weapons provided to Ukraine against military targets within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-victory-would-bring-chaos-french-fm-says/	2024-10-19T16:33:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179544991.jpg
Russia strikes Zaporizhzhia, injuring 10	At least 10 people were wounded in an aerial bomb attack on central Zaporizhzhia on the evening of Oct. 19, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. The National Police confirmed that Russian forces carried out three airstrikes on Zaporizhzhia using high-explosive bombs. The blasts partially destroyed a residential building and caused damage to nearby shops, a car wash, a shopping center warehouse, and several vehicles. Two girls, aged nine and 13, are among the injured and are receiving urgent medical care, Fedorov added via his Telegram channel. Zaporizhzhia Oblast in southeastern Ukraine remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s attacks. It is also one of the four oblasts Russia claims to have annexed in September 2022, although Ukrainian forces still control about a third of the oblast, including the regional capital. Russia has increased its air strikes on Zaporizhzhia, causing numerous civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Russian troops began using highly destructive guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Sept. 23. Before that, the city was targeted only with missiles and drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-zaporizhzhia-injuring-10/	2024-10-19T14:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-19-15_23_27.jpeg
With US elections looming, Biden’s Berlin swan song was all talk, no action on Ukraine	Joe Biden&apos;s likely last European visit as president was billed as a final chance before the upcoming U.S. presidential election to meet with key world leaders, solidify long-term support for Ukraine, and work towards ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched over two and a half years ago. &quot;Ukraine faces a tough winter. We must sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,&quot; Biden told reporters before the talks in Berlin on Oct. 18, as cited by the Washington Post. &quot;I know the cost is heavy. Make no mistake, it pales in comparison to the cost of living in a world where aggression prevails, where large states attack and bully smaller ones &#x2014; simply because they can.&quot; However, according to a joint statement released by the White House, Paris, Berlin, and London, Ukraine&apos;s situation and support from Western allies seem to have largely remained the same as they were the day before Biden&apos;s trip to Germany. It offered no new pledges of game-changing support beyond current levels of weaponry provided or progress on key issues such as authorizing long-range strikes inside Russia with Western weapons, NATO membership, or implementation of other requests within President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan.&quot; Instead, it repeated condemnation of &quot;Russia&#x2019;s continued war of aggression against Ukraine&quot; and highlighted &quot;discussions&quot; of &quot;plans&quot; for &quot;additional security, economic, and humanitarian assistance.&quot; The vague and non-committal language from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies contrasts starkly with the increased diplomatic urgency that has consumed Kyiv in recent weeks. Yet the reasons behind both are almost certainly the same &#x2014; the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, uncertainty about who will take over as leader of Ukraine&#x2019;s top Western ally, and how strong their backing for Kyiv will be. Recent polls show that in the approaching election, Biden&#x2019;s Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Party&#x2019;s candidate, is in a dead heat race with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has questioned support for Ukraine and has a history of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Kyiv, one fear is getting continued U.S. support under a Harris presidency coming at a pace even former NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg has said was too slow and gradual. A bigger one is having support sharply cut under a Trump administration. Both scenarios have triggered Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials to intensify efforts to secure long-term defense support now and push allies to ease restrictions on the use of their weapons for strikes in Russia. So far, Zelensky&#x2019;s administration has had limited success. &quot;The elections are currently, as they usually do, holding U.S. politics hostage and until the conclusion of it, no significant legislative change can be expected,&quot; Benjamin Bardos, a transatlantic security expert from the Warsaw Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) greets U.S. President Joe Biden at the Chancellery on Oct. 18, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)In late September, Zelensky met with Biden to present his five-point victory plan, which includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO before the war ends and authorization to strike deep inside Russia with Western long-range weapons. The plan also has three classified sections shared with international partners. Zelensky then toured Europe with the plan but has not yet secured the full support for the strategy from either American or European leaders. Just a week before Biden&#x2019;s visit, Zelensky also traveled to Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Following their meeting, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion). But Berlin continues refusing to send long-range Taurus missiles or allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets deep within Russia. &quot;We are supporting Ukraine as powerfully as we can and at the same time we are making sure that NATO does not become a party to the war, so that this war does not turn into an even bigger catastrophe,&quot; Scholz said in remarks to the press before the meeting with Biden on Oct. 18. Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and special representative to Ukraine under Trump&#x2019;s first presidency, said Biden&apos;s trip had two main goals. The first was to show the American public that Europe also contributes significantly to help Ukraine in its existential fight against Russia. Trump, who has since his first presidency lambasted European countries for not contributing enough to their defense while relying instead on U.S. taxpayers as an umbrella of security, has repeatedly said that Europe should do more to end the war raging on their continent. The second goal, according to Volker, was to discuss with allies how they can strengthen the EU&apos;s defense industry and provide Ukraine with more weapons to counter Russia&#x2019;s vast military power. Volker emphasized Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent need for more ammunition, longer-range munitions, improved air defense systems, and additional support in the Black Sea. However, he expressed uncertainty about whether these priorities align with the Biden administration&#x2019;s plans given the looming elections. &quot;What Ukraine needs is fairly obvious, they need more ammunition and they need it more quickly, they need to use the munitions that we&apos;re giving them at longer range,&quot; Volker said. &quot;So those are all things that are on the Ukrainian list. It&apos;s just that I&apos;m not sure they&apos;re on the Biden administration&apos;s list that they intend to do,&quot; Volker added.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Oct. 17 that Biden planned to consult with German, French, and U.K. leaders on what they had discussed with Zelensky during his European tour. White House spokesperson John Kirby later said that Washington is still reviewing Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; and expects to make further security commitments at the next meeting of Western allies within the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the regular Ramstein meetings. Biden had initially planned to visit Germany the prior weekend to take part in a Ramstein international meeting to coordinate aid to Ukraine. That trip was canceled due to Hurricane Milton in Florida. According to the White House, the Ramstein meeting has been rescheduled to be held online in November, though it&#x2019;s unclear if it will be before or after the U.S. elections. Catherine Sendak, director of the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that Western leaders have and will continue to discuss which parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; they support or want to adjust. She added that the authorization for long-range strikes against Russia with Western-provided weapons is &quot;a hot topic.&quot; &quot;Because there&apos;s such a lull in parts of the conversation in the Western world about Ukraine due to (U.S.) elections and a lot of other things, hyper-focusing on this issue (aid to Ukraine) again in the fall, I think, is very important,&quot; said Sendak. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint press conference with the German Chancellor prior to a meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, on Oct. 18, 2024. (Tobias Sschwarz/AFP)The U.S. has already indicated that Ukraine shouldn&apos;t expect a formal NATO invitation soon since there is still no consensus among allies. Although the latest NATO summit in the summer reaffirmed that Ukraine will join the military alliance, Sullivan said there is still &quot;work to do&quot; to get there, including &quot;reforms and security conditions being met.&quot; The reforms involve &quot;the institutionalization of the security support apparatus for Ukraine,&quot; Sullivan added. As Trump has indicated he would be more hesitant than Biden to provide military aid to Ukraine and suggested the U.S. should not defend NATO allies who don&#x2019;t pay their fair share, concerns have grown about potential global alliance shifts if he wins the presidency. When asked before the Berlin visit whether Biden has been &quot;Trump-proofing&quot; the U.S. government for a potential Trump presidency, Sullivan replied that Biden is working to make the U.S.&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine &quot;sustainable and institutionalized for the long term.&quot; &quot;Since President Biden is not running for office, he doesn&apos;t need to be here in the United States campaigning. He has an opportunity to sit down with world leaders and really hash out some significant support and assistance,&quot; said Sendak. However, Biden&apos;s visit to Germany was never likely to yield major decisions on increasing support for Ukraine or implementing key points of Zelensky&apos;s &quot;Victory Plan,&quot; such as a NATO invitation or permission for long-range strikes, according to Volker. &quot;The main reason is the same as always &#x2014; fear of escalation. Fear that Russia would view this as NATO playing a direct role in attacking Russia, fear of nuclear usage&#x2026;,&quot; he said. His comments refer to the Biden administration&#x2019;s long-lasting fear of Russia pulling allies into the war, potentially by conducting nuclear missile strikes on Ukraine. Any significant decision to increase support for Ukraine will likely be postponed until after the U.S. election also because Biden&#x2019;s administration is wary of Trump accusing them of pushing the country into World War III, which could hurt Kamala Harris&#x2019;s campaign. &quot;It&#x2019;s not a serious argument. It&#x2019;s a political argument,&quot; Volker said of Trump&#x2019;s election campaign rhetoric that has claimed U.S. support for Ukraine against Russia&#x2019;s invasion risks escalation into a global war. Bardos pointed to a Republican backlash over Zelensky&#x2019;s September visit to Pennsylvania, a key swing state, as one reason why congressional approval for foreign aid is &quot;off the table&quot; for now. Instead, any short-term U.S. support will likely come from the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which had about $2.8 billion remaining for the fiscal year as of late September, according to Bardos. Emphasizing that U.S. assistance to Ukraine and involvement in European security would unlikely come to a grinding halt in case of a Trump presidency, Sendak said the EU should nonetheless take on a larger role in ensuring continued aid to Ukraine. But not enough efforts have been made to strengthen the union&#x2019;s defense industry, she added. Bardos cautioned that EU resources would not be sufficient without continued large support from the U.S. &quot;While the EU member states possess significant defense industries, it would be close to impossible for the EU alone to &#x2018;step up&#x2019; support and fill the role of the U.S. without a comprehensive overhaul of individual member states&#x2019; defense industries and forming a united front in the EU, which as far as current politics goes, is extremely unlikely,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-us-elections-looming-bidens-berlin-swan-song-was-all-talk-no-action-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178315214.jpg
Ukraine’s NATO membership on 'irreversible path,' G7 defense ministers reaffirm	Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states. The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-membership-on-irreversible-path-g7-defense-ministers-reaffirm/	2024-10-19T11:49:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
US Intelligence Chairman urges immediate action on North Korean troop movements in Ukraine	U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to U.S. President Joseph Biden on Oct. 18 to respond immediately to reports of North Korea&apos;s troops preparing to join Russia&apos;s army fighting in Ukraine. North Korea troops attacking Ukraine from Russia or entering Ukraine &#x201C;must be a red line for the United States and NATO,&quot; Turner said. Turner also cited public reports from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence agencies that suggest North Korean troops may be moving via Russian naval vessels. Calling the situation &quot;alarming&quot; and a major escalation of the conflict, Turner urged the U.S. and NATO to act immediately. He requested an urgent classified briefing for the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, emphasizing the need for swift U.S. and NATO action to prevent a broader conflict. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-chairman-urges-immediate-action-on-north-korean-troop-movements-in-ukraine/	2024-10-19T09:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Investigation: Russians carry out systemic terror in occupied part of Kherson Oblast	On the morning of Nov. 20, 2023, Russians came to Raisa Rusnak&#x2019;s home, looking for her 28-year-old son Ruslan. Four masked men threw him onto the ground and began beating him. &quot;Guys, what have I done to you? What do you want from me?&quot; Ruslan shouted. Those were the final words Raisa heard from her son. She never saw him alive again. Eight days later, she identified his body at the morgue. She was told that he had died of internal bleeding from a stomach ulcer during interrogation by the Russian occupation police. The woman is convinced that her son was tortured to death. Even the official Russian death certificate states that Ruslan died on the day of his detention &#x2014; a week before she was informed of her son&apos;s death. &quot;He was lying there&#x2026; His eyes were open, his teeth were showing. He must have died in such torment. What my child endured, I can&#x2019;t even imagine,&quot; Raisa said. Ruslan was interrogated at the former Ukrainian police station in the town of Hornostaivka, on the Dnipro River&apos;s east bank, in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Moscow has controlled this territory since 2022. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of about 6,500 people, was occupied in April 2022. Raisa left the town for Ukrainian-controlled territory in early 2024. In the police headquarters on Torhova Street in Hornostaivka, where Ruslan was taken, the Russian occupation police have been operating for two and a half years. The occupiers have established a torture chamber in this building. Ruslan is one of many Ukrainians taken there by the Russians and not the only one for whom it ended fatally. The fate of many others remains unknown. Russia has terrorized the local population in torture chambers across the occupied territories, with previous reports indicating the use of this tactic in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as the previously occupied areas of Kherson Oblast.

Right: Ruslan Rusnak and his mother, Raisa Rusnak, who fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2024. (Courtesy)One of those missing is Oleksandr Slisarenko, a local entrepreneur and volunteer in Hornostaivka. When the Russians took control of the town, his wife left, but he decided to stay and help others. &quot;He was responsible for a lot of people. He could not leave them. &#x2018;Maybe you could come here?&#x2019; I&#x2019;d ask him. &#x2018;No,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t leave those grannies. It will get better soon,&#x2019;&quot; his wife Liudmyla recalls him saying. Liudmyla currently lives in Poland. Since leaving Hornostaivka in April 2022, she had kept in touch with her husband by phone and on messenger applications. But on Aug. 3, 2022, the connection was cut off: in the morning of that day, the occupiers took Oleksandr away. &quot;He went out into the yard to do some chores &#x2014; he came out in the same clothes he had slept in. And our house was, you could say, already surrounded. They tied his hands, put him on his knees, and began to torture him. He was beaten very badly on the spot. Witnesses saw it all. After that, he was thrown into a minibus with a bag over his head, and that was it,&quot; Liudmyla said. From that moment on, Oleksandr&#x2019;s trail was completely lost. Liudmyla does not even know if he was taken to the police station on Torhova Street. But she does know that it is common for Russians to imprison, interrogate, torture, and kill people there. Liudmyla told the Kyiv Independent that another victim of the Russian occupiers in Hornostaivka is Volodymyr Ruchka, a driver from the local health inspection service. He was also taken to the police station on Torhova Street in the first year of the occupation. &#x201C;He just said something, something they didn&#x2019;t like. They took him to the police station and beat him up. He was beaten, released, and he died the next day.&#x201D; The map shows the Dnipro River that divides Ukraine&apos;s southern Kherson Oblast into Russian-occupied territory east of the river and Ukrainian-controlled territory west of the river. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of 6,500 people, has been occupied since April 2022. (The Kyiv Independent)&#xA0;We learned similar stories from other residents of Hornostaivka who were able to leave. At present, interviewing such witnesses is the only way to learn about Russian war crimes in the occupied territories. The east bank of Kherson Oblast is under tight control, and no one but Russians have access to it: neither independent law enforcement agencies, nor documentarians, nor journalists. In the course of our investigation into Russian terror in the occupied territories, we interviewed dozens of people who managed to leave &#x2014; some of them as recently as the summer of 2024. Most of them asked for anonymity or refused to be interviewed out of fear of the Russians. Almost all of them have relatives or friends left in the occupation who could face retaliation for these testimonies. One woman from Hornostaivka told the Kyiv Independent that a story similar to that of Volodymyr Ruchka happened in the summer of 2023 with another man, Serhii Klopot. &#x201C;He was taken right from the market. They dragged him out of the store at the market, threw him into a minibus, and two days later, he was brought to his yard and dumped. His neighbors picked him up. Two days later, he died. He was beaten very badly,&#x201D; she said. She also said that shortly thereafter a group of Russian police officers, one of whom introduced himself as &quot;Vladimir,&quot; threatened her with meeting Klopot&apos;s fate. According to this woman, the Russians mainly persecuted former Ukrainian soldiers and weapons owners. Anyone who showed a pro-Ukrainian position could also be persecuted. However, other witnesses added that the Russians also terrorized business owners who could be deprived of their property. This was a particularly common practice during the first year of the occupation. &quot;Those who had businesses were detained for the purpose of ransom and so on. It was always solved the same way: you bring money, they let you go. People&apos;s cars were taken away in the middle of the night, they came, broke into garages and drove cars away, houses were robbed,&quot; said Henadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka who agreed to speak to us openly. Kryzhanovskyi, too, was held in the building on Torhova Street in the fall of 2022. He was released only after he signed a statement about the transfer of his cars for the needs of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;special military operation.&quot; He was able to leave the occupied territories only in July 2024.

After occupying Hornostaivka in April 2022, Russian occupation forces have turned the police headquarters into a torture chamber. (Courtesy)Kryzhanovskyi was not the only one forced by the Russians to &quot;voluntarily&quot; give up his property. Others include the pastor of the Baptist church in Hornostaivka, Oleksandr Maltsev. In the fall of 2022, Russian forces searched the church premises, and Maltsev himself was taken to Torhova Street. He spent a little over two weeks in detention and was forced to give away his two cars. Residents of Hornostaivka also told us that people not only from the town but also from neighboring villages and towns and even from the cities of Kakhovka and Nova Kakhovka, located tens of kilometers away, were brought to and held in the police station on Torhova Street. Olha (name changed) from the village of Kairy, eight kilometers from Hornostaivka, said that the Russians also took residents of her village to the police station on Torhova Street. &#x201C;They abducted people, tortured them and beat them. And as far as I know, those people were hit with everything, even electrocuted. They tortured them like that because they (Russians) wanted to show us that they were the masters and we were the simple people who must obey them. People said: they&#x2019;ve tried everything, except for one &#x2014; putting electrodes under the nails,&#x201D; said the woman who left Kairy in the summer of 2024. Olha also said that Russians could punish Ukrainians in the village even for saying &#x201C;Glory to Ukraine,&#x201D; a Ukrainian national salute. The screenshot from a video published by a Russian propaganda media outlet showing the Vladimir Lenin statue in Russian-occupied Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast.&#xA0;&quot;One man was taken by the arms and taken away. A week later, maybe a little more, we were told that he was found, and that they had killed him. Another woman had a birthday, was a little drunk, went to the store, and said, &apos;Glory to Ukraine, Glory to the Heroes.&apos; The Russian soldiers looked at each other, did not touch her at first. When the woman had just crossed the threshold to leave the store, they took her by her arms and stuffed her into a car... And I don&apos;t know whether she is alive or not, because the woman is missing too,&#x201D; Olha said. All of the testimonies we gathered paint a picture of systemic terror, with its epicenter in the torture chamber in Hornostaivka. This terror apparently began in August 2022 &#x2014; and continues to this day. Ruslan Rusnak, who was most likely tortured to death on Torhova Street in November 2023, was not the only one taken by the Russians in the town at that time. The same month, brothers Ivan and Anton Shtepa, as well as Denys Shum, were held there, too. It is not known where they are now. It was the case of Ruslan Rusnak that allowed us to identify the Russian police officers involved in his death and the terror of the local population. In February 2024, one of the Russian anonymous Telegram channels reported that in connection with his death, Russian law enforcement agencies were prosecuting five police officers from Hornostaivka for &#x201C;abuse of office.&#x201D; The message included the names and initials of these police officers. It was easy enough to identify one of them &#x2014; Andrey Polevshchikov, who was the head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka at the time of Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. A man very similar to him can be seen in a video shot in the town back in August 2023. In October, he spoke to a Russian propaganda media outlet about the work of the police. &quot;Citizens are happy to cooperate with the police because they see us as a helping hand. Initially, of course, you could see that the population was cautious of police officers, but when they saw our work in action, they welcomed us,&quot; Polevshchikov said in the video. Andrey Polevshchikov, the former head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka, speaks to a Russian propaganda media outlet in Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast, in August 2023. (The Kyiv Independent)Other names mentioned in this message from the anonymous Telegram channel were &quot;V. Pliukhin, V. Merkurov, I. Pimenov, and A. Denisov.&quot; We were able to identify Russian policemen Igor Pimenov and Vasily Merkurov but found no confirmed connection to Hornostaivka. In the case of &quot;V. Pliukhin,&quot; we decided to try out the name &quot;Vladimir&quot; (&quot;Volodymyr&quot; in Ukrainian) as standing for &quot;V,&quot; since several residents of Hornostaivka gave us this name in connection with the terror of Russian police officers. This is how we learned about Volodymyr Pliukhin, a former Ukrainian police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast who defected to Russia at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In the video mentioned earlier, Polevshchikov says, among other things, that a police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast has joined the staff of the Hornostaivka police station. We showed a photo of Volodymyr Pliukhin, found on the Internet, to several residents of Hornostaivka. Two of them recognized the policeman as the one who had participated in the terror in the town. One witness pointed out that this person was the &quot;Vladimir&quot; who threatened her with the fate of Serhii Klopot, who was tortured to death. Another witness, who was imprisoned in the police station of Hornostaivka, told us that this man was guarding the captives in Torhova Street in December 2022 &#x2014; and said to them that he was from Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

(The Kyiv Independent)We also learned the developments of the &quot;abuse of office&quot; charge against these policemen. Under the pretense of an association of former Russian police officers, we called Polevshchikov and offered to support him. He told us that the case had been opened on Feb. 1, 2024, almost two and a half months after Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. However, according to Polevshchikov, he no longer needs any help. &quot;The case has already been suspended. It will be terminated due to the injury. I signed a (military) contract and joined the &#x2018;special military operation.&#x2019; I&apos;m home already with an injured arm and leg. We came across a landmine,&quot; Polevshchikov told us in a phone conversation. He added that all the employees of the Russian-run Hornostaivka police station who had been prosecuted in the case joined the military and were wounded in action with him. By signing contracts to participate in the Russian-Ukrainian war and being &quot;wounded in action,&quot; the Russian policemen from Hornostaivka, in fact, avoided any responsibility for Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. When Raisa Rusnak learned of the Russian law enforcement investigation into her son&apos;s death, she did not believe in Russian justice. &quot;I think it was just a pretense, that&apos;s all,&quot; she told us. There are no great hopes for the official Ukrainian investigation, either. Law enforcement officers can&apos;t enter the occupied territory, they don&apos;t have access to the bodies to conduct all the necessary forensic examinations, and they can&apos;t interview witnesses on the spot. As for interviewing people who have managed to leave, they often face the same obstacle as journalists and documenters: people are too afraid to testify. Meanwhile, Russian terror continues on the occupied east bank of Kherson Oblast. And though some residents were lucky to have managed to flee, it is notoriously difficult for Ukrainians to leave the occupied territory. Ruslan Rusnak tried to do so in 2022, but the Russians would not let him out because of his former service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Hennadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka, was able to leave on his second attempt. Olha from the village of Kairy managed to leave with her husband and children. But while crossing the border, Russians beat her husband and threatened him with murder and her with sexual violence. Even those who leave the occupied territories often deal with the trauma from Russian terror, either from what they have experienced themselves or from what their relatives and friends have endured.

His other grandfather has been dead for some time. I want Oleksandr to see his grandson grow up,&quot; she said, barely holding back tears. For Raisa Rusnak, the Russian occupation terror took away her son, her home, and justice, leaving nothing but nightmares. &quot;I moved to my daughter&apos;s place and have given her no rest. I have cried day and night. I imagine how they are killing my child, and I get scared. In my nightmares, I now see my daughter being abducted or my second son taken away. And I scream at night, I disturb everyone&apos;s sleep. I cry and scream at night. That&apos;s it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-russians-carry-out-systemic-terror-in-occupied-part-of-kherson-oblast/	2024-10-19T09:29:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-19-at-17_54_12.jpg
At least 102 Ukrainian POWs executed by Russia, ombudsman says	Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity. Lubinets said that Ukrainian authorities document the cases as much as possible and pass the evidence to the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation. &quot;In my opinion, the main reason (for the executions) is that the Russian military does everything possible so that Russian soldiers have no desire to surrender to Ukraine,&quot; Lubinets said. Apart from that, Russians kill prisoners to demonstrate their disregard for international law, according to Lubinets. &quot;They want to show that they are not going to be punished for it (by the international community),&quot; he added. &quot;This is a deliberate policy of Russia, but international organizations turn a blind eye,&quot; Lubinets said. &quot;I see no public or legal reaction to these events - there are still no arrest warrants for war criminals,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/102-ukrainian-pows-executed-by-russia-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-19T08:12:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2037955866.jpg
Romania says drone breached its airspace during Russia's attack on Ukraine	An unidentified flying object was detected by Romanian radar systems near the Black Sea during Russia&apos;s overnight attack on Ukraine on Oct. 19, the Romanian Defense Ministry said. It is the second time this week that Romanian airspace has been violated, following the incident only a day ago, when Romania and Belarus scrambled jets in response to targets flying in their airspace during the Russian drone attack on Ukraine late on Oct. 17. On Oct. 19, Romania once again scrambled two F-16 fighter jets and two Spanish F-18s that are used for air policing missions in the country. In both incidents, the targets disappeared from the radars before the pilots could find them. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Oct. 18 that the incident could have been a cyber attack against the country&apos;s defense system since &quot;pilots did not have visual contact with the drone.&quot; Russia launched up to 98 drones and six missiles against Ukraine on Oct. 19, injuring people and causing destruction that led to power outages in three Ukrainian regions. &#xA0; Romania, a NATO member, has reported numerous incidents when its airspace was violated over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and condemned Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine as violations of international law. Over the past year, debris from Russian drones were found on the Romanian territory as Russia carried out attacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-says-drone-breached-its-airspace-during-russias-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T07:28:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1779469255.jpg
Russian major killed by car bomb in occupied Luhansk, Ukraine's intelligence claims	Russian Major Dmitriy Pervukha was killed in the center of Russian-occupied Luhansk after his car exploded, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 19. &quot;On Oct. 18, 2024, at about 11:40 a.m., a UAZ Patriot car exploded&quot; on one of the streets in Luhansk, HUR said on Telegram. Pervukha was inside the car, according to HUR. Pervukha was allegedly involved in war crimes against Ukraine. He served in the 273rd Intelligence Center of the Russian Armed Forces , located in Russia&apos;s Novosibirsk. In the occupied territories of Ukraine, Pervukha held the position of the so-called &#x201C;chief of staff for military service and security of military service,&#x201D; according to HUR. Russian Investigative Committee announced that a criminal case was opened on Oct. 18 to investigate the explosion that killed an unnamed man and wounded a woman in another car. While HUR called Pervukha &quot;a war criminal&quot; and said that every crime against Ukraine would be &quot;justly punished,&quot; it didn&apos;t claim responsibility for the attack. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, numerous assasinations of Russian military commanders, officials, and collaborators via car bombs were reported in the Russian-occupied Crimea, parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-major-killed-by-car-bomb-in-occupied-luhansk-ukraines-intelligence-claims/	2024-10-19T06:06:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gur-pervukh-2.jpg
Russian attacks kill 4 people over the past day, cause power outages in 3 Ukrainian regions	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 20 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 19. Ukrainian air defenses downed 4 out of 6 guided air missiles Kh-59/69 and 42 attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-six drones were countered by electronic warfare means. In total, over 100 air targets were detected by Ukrainian forces during the Russian attack. Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry reported on the morning of Oct. 19 that over 73,000 consumers in three oblasts were left without electricity due to Russia&apos;s recent attacks. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. On Oct. 19, Russia launched a missile and drone attack against Cherkasy Oblast in the center of Ukraine, killing an elderly woman in Uman district and hitting a critical infrastructure facility, said Governor Ihor Taburets. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and two more wounded in Russian strikes in Kurakhovo and Hirnyk, said Governor Vadym Filashkin. Russian attacks also wounded nine people in Kherson Oblast, hitting residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Sumy Oblast, a man&apos;s body was found under the rubble of a building in Shostka following three aviation bomb strikes overnight, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported. Eight other people were wounded, including five rescuers from the local emergency service department that was hit by Russia. At the time of the attack, emergency workers were at the shelter, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said. In Kyiv, one woman was wounded by a piece of shrapnel from the drone attack overnight, said Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. In Odesa, a missile strike caused a fire in a residential area of the city, damaging a three-story residential building and 10 houses, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said. No casualties were reported. In Chernihiv Oblast, the Russian strike hit an infrastructure facility, causing fire, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-people-over-the-past-day/	2024-10-19T04:45:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/odesa-kiper.jpg
Puzzle company Frisson helps Ukrainians escape wartime reality	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. As a child, Kseniya Morozenko would piece together cut-up postcards at her grandmother&#x2019;s home in Donetsk Oblast. Years later, Morozenko was stuck at her apartment in Kyiv during the Covid-19 pandemic and remembered the homemade jigsaw puzzles from her childhood. She searched in shops in Ukraine, but could only find jigsaws for children, which gave her the idea to set up Frisson, a puzzle company featuring Ukrainian artwork geared towards adults. &#x201C;I want to support Ukrainian modern art and contemporary artists and show their work through puzzles,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent at a trendy bookshop in Kyiv that sells Frisson&#x2019;s products. The puzzles are elegantly packaged with the pieces wrapped inside an environmentally-friendly mesh bag and bundled with two coasters, a postcard, a note, and a poster of the design. Morozenko says she was inspired by Apple&#x2019;s boxing and spent a long time crafting the packaging, including hand-stitching the first 200 mesh bags herself. In 2020, the market was wide open for Frisson as no one else was doing anything like it in Ukraine. Morozenko, who had spent nine years working as a client manager with Ukrainian brands, invested $5,000 of her own money into the project and is a one-man team, although she recently hired a social media manager. By the summer of 2021, nine months after Morozenko conceived the idea, Frisson began producing its first jigsaws in Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s printing mecca. The first puzzle retailed for Hr 500 ($12) and featured one of Morozenko&#x2019;s favorite murals in Kyiv painted by artists Viktoriya Lime and Andrii Kovtun. (L-R) Ksenia Morozenko, a founder of Frisson holds Frisson products. (Maryna Khmarka / Frisson)Supporting artistsMorozenko now has a queue of artists wanting to work with Frisson but she only selects those who are involved with charity projects. So far, the company has worked with 15 artists on 22 designs, including large 500-piece puzzles and smaller 100-piece postcard jigsaws, which are all made with recycled materials. Many of the artists have a notable following in Ukraine, including the globally-known artist and muralist Waone, and the designs often sell out quickly as they are limited to a run of 200. The artists set the price themselves, starting at $100, and Morozenko pays them upfront, particularly now with the uncertainty of war. &#x201C;You never know what will happen tomorrow,&#x201D; she said. Frisson has sold over 3,000 puzzles via its online store and 20 shops across Ukraine, including Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and smaller cities like Uzhhorod and Ivano-Frankivsk. Morozenko also hauls jigsaws to artisan markets and makes specially commissioned pieces for companies. With the larger puzzles retailing for Hr 700 ($17) and the smaller ones for Hr 300 ($7), Morozenko wants to spread the work of established artists to a bigger audience. &#x201C;The puzzles make art accessible to everyone,&#x201D; she said. Foreign artists have also contacted Morozenko, eager to work with Frisson. She is contemplating the idea, but says she will only work with artists from countries that are supportive of Ukraine like Lithuania, Canada, and the U.K. While Frisson is becoming more popular abroad, with orders from the U.S. and Australia, most customers are in Ukraine where Morozenko has spent the last few years building up a &#x201C;puzzle culture&#x201D; for grown-ups.

(Olha Rudnieva / Frisson)Like the puzzle boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, many Ukrainians are seeking comfort and escape from the brutal reality through jigsaws. At the start of the full-scale invasion, one of Frisson&#x2019;s most popular designs featured a group of friends enjoying a picnic. &#x201C;People ordered it as a gift and sent it to their friends with a postcard saying, &#x201C;Imagine it&apos;s us after our victory.&#x201D; I would sign and personalize the postcard,&#x201D; Morozenko said. The puzzles have also helped veterans. The company partnered with the Superhumans Center in Lviv for wounded soldiers and Morozenko says the jigsaws help with both physical and mental rehabilitation. One soldier even completed the puzzle with his prosthetic arm, surprising the doctors who didn&#x2019;t believe it was possible to clasp the small pieces. &#x201C;I just cried after seeing that,&#x201D; Morozenko said. At the outbreak of the war, Morozenko had to shut down printing operations in Kharkiv as Russian troops attempted to besiege the city. For two months she searched for a new printing facility, eventually finding one in Lviv after a tip from another company making puzzles. Frisson still had stockpiles of puzzles from the Kharkiv printing factory and began sending 50% of the money from sales to the Armed Forces. Morozenko strongly believes that every Ukrainian company should help the war effort and Frisson has a collection of charity puzzles with half of the proceeds going to NGOs or the army. The company also ships free jigsaws to organizations that help orphaned children and displaced people. Morozenko wants to bring people together through her puzzles and her slogan &#x201C;Better Together&#x201D; is proudly printed on the front of every box. With success at home, Morozenko is preparing to expand into the foreign market too. So far, the Ukrainian diaspora in countries like the U.K. and Canada has brought Frisson&#x2019;s puzzles but Morozenko wants to expand further. L: A hnd holding one of the Frisson products.

The program, launched by the Ukrainian government and USAID, will train and mentor companies on how to set up online Etsy stores and open doors to foreign markets. In addition to jigsaws, Morozenko also knits and sells anti-stress balls and coasters, while also signing postcards, personalized notes, and running between different artisan markets. Despite managing the company entirely by herself, with the occasional helping hand from friends who model for photoshoots, Morozenko finds the inspiration to keep going from the artists and organizations she works with. &#x201C;If they don&#x2019;t stop, how could I?&#x201D; she said. Frisson turns peaceful moments into artful experiences through its unique jigsaw puzzles, created in partnership with well-known Ukrainian artists. During these tough times, Frisson provides a sense of solace to Ukrainians, including veterans in rehabilitation.

MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 77	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 77 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 7- Oct. 13, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The parliament adopted in the final reading the draft law on tax increase. On Oct. 10, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the final reading draft law #11416-d to increase taxes. However, one key amendment which included all major suggestions from the Tax Committee was rejected during the voting. Particularly the norm which enables the draft law to come into force retrospectively from October 1. For example, it seems that the increase of military levy will be applied only after the draft law is signed and published that will decrease expected revenues from its adoption. The draft law also provides in 2024 50% of income tax for banks as a windfall tax, although the NBU, the IMF, and the Finance Ministry were against this. During the revision, lawmakers slightly relaxed the burden of the law by saving the military levy at 1.5% for military service people. Overall, the draft law is expected to bring around Hr 25-30 billion ($600&#x2013;700 million) of additional budget revenues this year and Hr 150-160 billion ($3.6&#x2013;$3.9 billion) in 2025. After the adoption, some of the lawmakers submitted 13 resolutions to cancel the decision of the parliament. However, on Oct. 14, the Rada rejected all resolutions and unblocked the opportunity for the speaker to sign the draft law. It has been already sent to the Office of the President for signing. The Parliament adopted a draft law needed to fulfill the obligation to increase the number of the HACC&#x2019;s members. The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11426 to prolong the mandate of the Public Council of International Experts (PCIE) which will vet candidates to the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) till the end of selection process but no later than Nov. 1, 2025. This step is needed given the PCIE&#x2019;s expiry in October 2024, as more time is needed to finish the ongoing selection process of new HACC judges. The adoption of the draft law implements the EU recommendations, soft commitments to the IMF and will make a necessary step for Ukraine to be able to fulfill the obligations of the Ukraine Facility to increase the number of HACC&#x2019;s members (with the deadline set for the first quarter 2025). The Parliament considered two draft laws required by the Ukraine Plan. Last week the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy which is one of the obligations under the Ukraine Facility financial mechanism. Moreover, the Parliament adopted in the first reading the resubmitted revised draft law on plea agreements #12039. The new draft was supported by SAPO and NABU. The new provisions of the draft law allow for a shorter prison term than currently required in case of cooperation with the investigation through exposure of accomplices and compensation for damage. For example, five years of imprisonment instead of eight years. At the same time, the court will be able to determine a large fine up to Hr 102 million ($2.4 million) as an additional punishment and confiscate the property. What is important, that this mechanism can&#x2019;t be applied as a general rule to organizers of corruption schemes, with the exception of cases in which such an organizer exposes another organizer. Ukrainska Pravda reports systematic pressure from the Presidential Office. Last week, one of the key independent Ukrainian media outlets Ukrainska Pravda released an official statement to report the ongoing and systematic pressure of the Presidential Office on the editorial team and certain journalists of Ukrainska Pravda. In particular, the media accused the office of blocking officials from communicating with Ukrainska Pravda journalists and participating in events; pressure on businesses to stop advertising cooperation with Ukrainska Pravda; openly emotionally-charged communication between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Kravets during the public press conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-77/	2024-10-19T03:26:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 151	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 151 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 6-12, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s CEO Yevhen Liashchenko filed a resignation letter, the company&#x2019;s supervisory board said on Oct. 7. The board added that it planned to consider the resignation according to the applicable procedures in the coming days. There was no news on the results of that consideration at the time of writing. Formally, for Ukrzaliznytsia, it was the Cabinet of Ministers that decided on CEO appointments and dismissals on proposal of the supervisory board, meaning that Cabinet could not appoint or dismiss the CEO without such a proposal. The SOE law changed significantly in February 2024 (see our Issue 120), and it is the supervisory board&#x2019;s exclusive power now. As we wrote in Issue 80, on March 21, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Yevhen Liashchenko as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years to replace Oleksandr Kamyshin, who had become the new strategic industries minister. In September 2024, Kamyshin stepped down from his ministerial post and is now a presidential advisor and member of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board (see our Issue 146). Previously, Liashchenko served as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board member, responsible for finance. There were no public comments from Liashchenko on his resignation; however, several reputable media &#x2014; including Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and Forbes Ukraine &#x2014; suggested several possible reasons. According to EP, the resignation coincided with the appointment of Oleksiy Kuleba as the new deputy prime minister for restoration &#x2014; minister for communities and territories development, who is now responsible infrastructure sector, and Kamyshin&#x2019;s return to Ukrzaliznytsia as a supervisory board member. After his resignation, Liashchenko would return to the position of an executive board member until the end of his contract, i.e., for another six months, the media outlet added. According to EP&#x2019;s sources, the reason for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is also connected with Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new priorities, primarily to raise funds for capital investments, including the modernization of the company&#x2019;s infrastructure and rolling stock. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources also confirmed this. &#x201C;Liashchenko was supposed to stabilize the company, and he did that. Now the company faces new challenges and needs a different person. Ukrzaliznytsia needs a completely different pace of change. It needs to accelerate,&#x201D; the media&#x2019;s source at the Cabinet of Ministers said. One of the possible reasons for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is that he failed to adequately communicate the need for raising freight tariffs to businesses. Without this, Ukrzaliznytsia would not be able to achieve financial stability, the source added. As we reported in Issue 72, Ukrzaliznytsia incurred losses of Hr 10.8 billion in 2022 (318 million euros at that time). The loss from passenger transportation was Hr 13.3 billion (391 million euros at the time), suggesting that the company&#x2019;s other segments, such as cargo transportation, made a profit of Hr 2.5 billion (73 million euros). As we wrote in Issue 80, in March 2023, after his appointment as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years, Liashchenko got several key tasks, one of which was for the company to break even. In September 2023, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia was reaching break-even and would finish the first nine months of 2023 with a profit (see Issue 103). Ultimately, the company finished 2023 with a net profit of Hr 5 billion ($121 million). See Issue 127 for more detail. On Nov. 20 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s financial plan for 2024, with forecast losses of Hr 12.6 billion (&#x20AC;323 million). See Issue 112 for more detail. As we wrote in September, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia made a profit of up to Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in the first half of 2024, but lost Hr 600-700 million ($14-16 million) in July-August and expected a minor loss by the end of 2024 due to a decline in profitable types of cargo. See Issue 146 for more detail. According to EP, liga.net, and Forbes Ukraine, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, head of the company&#x2019;s passenger business (and executive board member), is likely to become the new CEO. Pertsovskyi could be appointed as soon as this week, liga.net added. According to EP, in addition to Liashchenko, other changes are expected on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board: Two seats would be cut, with these officers moving to other positions within the company. The number of executive board members would be reduced from eight to seven, with the above two positions replaced by a member in charge of HR, the media outlet wrote. Since an independent supervisory board was established at Ukrzaliznytsia in 2018, the company has seen six CEO changes. Much of this six-year period, the company was managed by acting CEOs. Since its establishment in late 2020, the SOE Weekly has covered the four most recent CEO changes at Ukrzaliznytsia. See our Issues 19, 39, and 80 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia requires substantial long-term transformation and faces several challenges. These include unbundling its different businesses, such as cargo and passenger services. It must also address its implicit public service obligation, as passenger transportation is currently loss-making and is cross-subsidised by cargo revenues. Additionally, the company needs to renew its worn-out fixed assets and prepare for competition once private companies are allowed to provide locomotive services. In addition, Ukrzaliznytsia faces wartime challenges, including the assignment to evacuate people from areas near the frontline. To handle these issues, the company needs a permanent CEO with a long-term planning horizon. The selection of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new supervisory board has not started, despite legal requirements. As we wrote almost three years ago, the Cabinet approved members of the railway operator&#x2019;s supervisory board on Dec. 29 2021 (see our Issue 60). Anatoliy Amelin, Alexander Doll, Jakub Karnowski, and Gebhard Hafer became independent members, while Serhiy Leshchenko, Serhiy Moskalenko and David Lomjaria were appointed as state representatives on the board. According to the law effective at the time of appointment, as well the company&#x2019;s charter, the maximum term of office of supervisory board members is three years. Thus, the tenure of the above supervisory board should expire on Dec. 28, 2024. Since 2021, only the recent appointment of Oleksandr Kamyshin as a supervisory board member of Ukrzaliznytsia (state representative) has been known publicly. According to media reports, Kamyshin replaced Serhiy Moskalenko in this position. At the same time, the mandatory disclosures that joint-stock companies must make according to the capital markets law and disclosure regulations of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), are not available on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website. In particular, the information on company officers, such as the management and supervisory board, is missing. Also, according to the new requirements of the SOE law (which were introduced by Law No. 3587, effective March 8 &#x2014; see our Issue 122), the selection of supervisory board candidates for an SOE must begin no later than three months before the respective supervisory board member&#x2019;s term of office ends (unless a decision has been made to extend his/her term of office), or no later than 10 days from the day of his/her early termination of powers. The SOE law now also requires that such selections must follow the principles of collective suitability, board diversity, equality of requirements, professionalism, openness, and transparency. This means that the Cabinet, as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s ownership entity, should have made a decision &#x2014; by Sept. 29 &#x2014; to either extend the powers of the current supervisory board members or announce a selection of board members. PrivatBank appoints a new CEO. On Oct. 7, PrivatBank announced that its supervisory board had elected Mikael Bjorknert (Sweden) as the bank&#x2019;s new CEO, following a competitive selection that included high-calibre candidates from both Ukraine and abroad. Bj&#xF6;rknert&#x2019;s candidacy is pending approval by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The bank said that Bj&#xF6;rknert has over 25 years of experience in the financial sector. Most recently, he served as head of Swedish Banking at Swedbank. Before joining Swedbank, Bj&#xF6;rknert held the position of Chairman of the Board at Swedish Bankgirot, Head of Global Transaction Services at SEB Bank, and Member of the Board at Nasdaq (Sweden). At PrivatBank, Bjorknert will focus on advancing the bank&#x2019;s customer-centric model, accelerating digital initiatives, and ensuring future-proofing, the bank added. Preparing the bank for privatization is not listed among Bjorknert&#x2019;s tasks, as it was for PrivatBank&#x2019;s current CEO, Gerhard Bosch. As we reported in late June 2024, Bosch filed his resignation notice. According to EP, the unofficial reason was the discrepancy between the tasks assigned to Bosch and the reality: When Bosch was elected as PrivatBank&#x2019;s CEO in May 2021, his tasks included preparing the bank for privatization. However, during the full-scale war, this process was put on hold, EP wrote. See Issue 138 for more detail. As we wrote in September 2024, Bosch&#x2019;s contract would be terminated on Nov. 1. Forbes Ukraine then wrote that unless the winner of the competitive selection for the new CEO is determined by that time, one of the executive board members would start managing the bank as an acting CEO. (See Issue 147 for more detail.) However, if Bjorknert is cleared by the NBU, PrivatBank will not require an interim CEO, with its competitive selection appropriately completed on time. Competitive selection for three independent members for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board announced. On Oct. 10, the Economy Ministry announced that the SOE Nomination Committee approved the candidate requirements. The deadline to apply is Oct. 31. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. &#x201C;We strongly believe that the decision on the early dismissal of the CEO of Ukrenergo is politically motivated and, based on the results of the presented report, there are no valid grounds for it,&#x201D; they said in a statement. Currently, Roman Pionkowski is the only remaining independent member of the supervisory board of Ukrenergo. He was appointed together with other independent members in December 2021, meaning that his term of office should expire in December 2024. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine will have access to about $1.1 billion. According to the IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry [in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the ministry added back then. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. As we reported in June 2023, the Cabinet still had to select and approve one independent member for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. Hence, independent members did not constitute a majority of the board, which did not meet the requirements of the law or Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter. See our Issue 95 for more detail. As we reported in April 2024 (Issue 129), the Economy Ministry announced a competitive selection to find the lacking independent board member. See Issue 129 for more detail. The Economy Ministry expects that by Nov. 7, the executive search consultant will have conducted a preliminary assessment of the documents, interviewed the applicants, and submitted a list of potential candidates. The selection of all board members &#x2013; four independent and three state representatives &#x2013; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. UMCC finally sold. On Oct. 9, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC) for Hr 3.94 billion ($95 million), just Hr 39 million ($948,000) more than the starting price of Hr 3.9 billion ($94.8 million). On Oct. 11, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the results of the auction. The sale of UMCC was the country&#x2019;s second online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, the SPFU said. The first one was Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel, which was sold for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million). See Issue 148 for more detail. According to the SPFU and Prozorro.Sale, the only bidder, and, accordingly, the winner, is Cemin Ukraine LLC, owned by Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Hasanov. Hasanov is the owner of the Azerbaijani NEQSOL Holding, which is known in Ukraine for being the owner of the telecom company Vodafone Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, NEQSOL also owns the telecom operator Bakcell. Besides, NEQSOL has extensive experience in the mining business. Its subsidiary, Nobel Oil E&amp;P, is engaged in exploration and production, while Nobel Energy provides services to oil and gas operators. NEQSOL&#x2019;s oil and gas production business is concentrated in Azerbaijan, the U.S., and the U.K. According to the privatization terms, the winner must maintain UMCC&#x2019;s core business and invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.7 million) in technical re-equipment and modernization. In addition, it must pay off overdue accounts payable (Hr 609 million or $14.8 million) and wage and budget arrears, if any, at the time of transfer of ownership, the SPFU explained. Also, 20% VAT is added to the purchase price, bringing the total value of the lot to nearly Hr 5 billion ($121 million), Oleksiy Movchan, deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Economic Development, noted. &#x201C;NEQSOL aims to implement its plans to modernize, develop new products through deep processing of raw materials and expand into global markets alongside fulfilling all privatization obligations,&#x201D; NEQSOL Holding&#x2019;s Country Director Volodymyr Lavrenchuk said. UMCC is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest titanium ore concentrate mining and processing company. It comprises Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Irshansk Plant in Zhytomyr Oblast. In October 2023, UMCC resumed shipments of ilmenite concentrate to the European market (see Issue 106 for more detail). The company&#x2019;s net profit for the first half of 2024 was over Hr 61.6 million (1.4 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). This was not the first attempt to sell UMCC. As we wrote in Issue 33 three years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that auction because it only had one qualified bidder. The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatization, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was inadequate. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company&#x2019;s mineral deposits. The SPFU&#x2019;s auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for more). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for more detail). See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57. In Issue 105, we reported that the SPFU changed UMCC&#x2019;s executive board, dismissing first deputy CEO Yaroslava Maksymenko and replacing her with Yegor Perelygin in September 2023. As we wrote in Issue 135, the Cabinet appointed Perelygin as UMCC&#x2019;s acting CEO on June 4. As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. The starting price would be determined with BDO Corporate Finance, the SPFU&#x2019;s advisor on the privatisation of UMCC. However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October 2023 that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant. Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot. The SPFU auction commission determined the terms of UMCC&#x2019;s privatisation on May 23, setting the starting price at Hr 3.9 billion (90 million euros at that time). See Issue 133 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 150, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) completed the pre-trial investigation into the Dmytro Sennychenko case, alleging the SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices of embezzling millions from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and UMCC in 2019-2021. See our Issues 80, 83, 114, 131, and 150 for detail. Cabinet puts seized VSMPO Titan Ukraine on privatization list. On Oct. 8, the Cabinet of Ministers added one more seized Russian company to the large-scale privatization list &#x2014; the Nikopol plant of seamless titanium alloy pipes, or VSMPO Titan Ukraine. The SPFU said that value of the company&#x2019;s assets as of Dec. 31, 2023 was Hr 271.7 million ($6.6 million). The auction commission will set the starting price and terms of sale and submit them to the Cabinet for approval. After that, the date of the privatization auction will be announced, the SPFU added. As we wrote almost two years ago (Issue 72), the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) seized a part of Russian oligarch Mikhail Shelkov&#x2019;s Ukrainian assets, including VSMPO Titan Ukraine, in January 2023. On Feb. 3, 2023, the HACC seized Shelkov&#x2019;s another key asset, the Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant (see Issue 74). Shortly after that, the Cabinet transferred Shelkov&#x2019;s assets to the SPFU, including Demurinsky (see Issue 77). In October 2023, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said that the SPFU intended to offer investors to buy Demurinsky as a single package with UMCC (see Issue 109). Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot (see Issue 133). As we wrote in Issue 140, on July 9, the Cabinet added Demurinsky to the large privatization list.
