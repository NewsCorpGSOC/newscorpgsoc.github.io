Pro-war blogger arrested in Russia after criticizing Kremlin	A Russian court said on Oct. 7 it had placed Yegor Guzenko, a pro-war blogger who has criticized the Kremlin, in custody on charges of &quot;using violence&quot; against a police officer. Guzenko is the author of the popular Telegram channel Trinadtsaty (Thirteenth), which has over 300,000 subscribers. He covers Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, writing posts in support of Moscow&apos;s invasion. Guzenko had previously participated in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast since 2015 and in the Syrian civil war in 2019. In September, Guzenko spoke out against Russian authorities, criticizing the arrest of ex-warlord Igor Girkin and saying that &quot;traitors have taken over the country.&quot; The videos were soon deleted from his Telegram channel, according to Meduza. Girkin, also known by his alias &quot;Strelkov,&quot; is an ex-intelligence officer who played a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine in 2014. Girkin was arrested in July 2023 over his Telegram posts on extremism charges. His comments were often critical of the Kremlin&apos;s conduct in the war. Guzenko was detained in the town of Novopavlovsk in Stavropol Krai on Oct. 5. The Baza Telegram channel claimed that initially he was detained on suspicion of using drugs but the blogger &quot;resisted&quot; the police. According to the Mash Telegram channel, Guzenko was at a concert wearing a mask and, when the police asked him to take it off, he allegedly attacked them with his fists. In 2022, Guzenko was prosecuted on hooliganism charges after allegedly shooting a person in the face with pepper spray.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-kremlin-blogger-arrested-in-russia-nearly-month-after-criticizing-authorities/	2024-10-07T10:47:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-05_15-23-31.jpg
Ukraine, Slovakia to create joint energy hub, Shmyhal says	Kyiv and Bratislava have begun work on creating an energy hub to strengthen the energy security of Eastern Europe, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a press conference with his Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico on Oct. 7. Amid rolling blackouts caused by Russian attacks, Slovakia has become the second-largest country in terms of both emergency and commercial electricity exports to Ukraine, according to Shmyhal. &quot;We want Ukraine to go through winter properly. In the case of a blackout, we will provide emergency energy supplies,&quot; Fico reaffirmed. The new energy hub envisages the use of existing gas storage facilities and cooperation in the field of nuclear energy. Ukraine and Slovakia are also planning to carry out a joint project to modernize the Mukachevo &#x2014; Velke Kapusany electrical interconnector. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2028. &quot;As a result, we will expand our export and import capabilities and strengthen the energy security of both countries,&quot; the Ukrainian prime minister said. According to the Foreign Ministry, Slovakia is also expected to allocate 500,000 euros ($548,000) for Ukraine&apos;s energy needs and restoration of the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Shmyhal confirmed that Kyiv will not prolong the transit deal for Russian gas, signed in 2019 and currently set to expire in December 2024. Russia cut much of its pipeline gas transit to Europe in 2022, but countries like Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia remain heavily reliant on Russian imports. &quot;We understand the acute dependence of some countries, in particular Slovakia, on this resource. But we are counting on a gradual diversification of supplies,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-slovakia-to-create-joint-eastern-european-energy-hub-shmyhal-says/	2024-10-07T09:21:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-07_16-06-45.jpg
Will the Middle East crisis affect Iran's supply of ballistic missiles to Russia? It's complicated	Russia&apos;s supply of ballistic missiles from Iran, confirmed last month by the U.S., is not expected to be immediately affected by escalating tensions in the Middle East, but two complicating factors could cause longer term issues. Iran launched its largest-ever aerial attack against Israel on Oct. 1, with nearly 200 missiles fired that day, sparking fears of a broader war in the region. According to the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), 180 of them were ballistic missiles. Which begs the question &#x2014; will Iran&apos;s recently increased need for ballistic missiles affect the still relatively fledgling supply of them to Russia? According to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the answer is &quot;a little bit complicated.&quot; Though reports over a period of months mentioned several different candidates for the type of missiles Iran was sending Russia, U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month confirmed it was the Fath-360 that had been delivered. Fath-360 launcher at Iranian army parade in an Unknown location in 2022. (Wikimedia)The Fath-360 is a close-range ballistic missile with a 150-kilogram warhead, and a range of 120 kilometers. Given the shortest distance between Israel and Iran is around 1,000 kilometers, Fath-360s would have little value in an all-out war between the armed forces of the two countries. If the U.S. became involved and Iran wanted to target U.S. military targets in the region, they would also be of little use. &quot;The Iranians themselves don&apos;t really need them in a confrontation with Israel and the U.S.,&quot; Hinz told the Kyiv Independent, pointing out Iran has several other models specifically for such purposes. After the Oct. 1 attack, Tehran claimed it had used four different types of ballistic missile in the strike, the Emad, Ghadr, Kheibar Shekan, and Fattah-1, all with a range capable of striking Israel. &quot;The kind of missiles that Iran uses to attack Israel were never really on the table for use in Ukraine because the range is not what the Russians need,&quot; Hinz said. Since it&#x2019;s a tactical system, Moscow will likely use Iran&apos;s Fath-360 to strike critical assets in the Ukrainian rear areas, for example, logistics bases, weapons depots, and air defense systems. Obtaining Fath-360 means Russia is now free to save its own more expensive and further reaching missiles, such as the Iskander, for longer-range strikes into Ukraine. From the perspective of what the armed forces of Russia and Iran both currently need from a ballistic missile system, the war in Ukraine, and a broader war in the Middle East are unlikely to affect supplies of Fath-360s to Moscow. &quot;That being said, these missiles could be supplied to proxies,&quot; Hinz adds. According to the Wilson Center, Iran funds, arms, and trains proxy militia groups in at least six countries &#x2014; Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Syria and Yemen. In the event of a broader war in the Middle East, it&apos;s highly likely Iran would bring them into play, and given many of these groups are far closer to Israel and U.S. bases, the ability to hit them with short-range ballistic missiles would be useful for Tehran. &quot;When it comes to really short-range stuff, the real competition would be between supplying them to Russia or supplying them to Iranian proxies,&quot; Hinz said. &quot;You&apos;d maybe supply them to Iraqi militias so you could fire them at US bases, for example.&quot; There&apos;s one more factor that could affect Russia&apos;s supplies. While Iran may not have a strong need itself for Fath-360s, there are several overlaps in the production process for different models of ballistic missile.

(Zain Jaafar/AFP via Getty Images)Hinz describes what we know for certain about Iran&apos;s ballistic missile production process as &quot;murky,&quot; but says an increased need for long-range weapons could create bottlenecks for the production of short-range models. &quot;We don&apos;t know exactly where (Fath-360s) are being produced but it could be possible that the facilities they&apos;re being produced at also produce the longer range stuff, especially when it comes to solid-propellant motors,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes you have facilities that produce both large and small solid propellant motors, so then you would have a bit of a conflict of interest. &quot;Another issue is the motors use the same propellant that the longer range missiles use, so that&apos;s also an area where you could run into competing interests.&quot; With no Fath-360s so far reported as being used in Ukraine and the world awaiting Israel&apos;s response to Iran&apos;s Oct. 1 attack, medium and long-term events in both wars are difficult to predict. &quot;The situation in the Middle East will probably not yet affect Iranian supplies of ballistic missiles to Russia, especially if you already have a deal done,&quot; Hinz concludes.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-the-middle-east-crisis-affect-irans-supply-of-ballistic-missiles-to-russia-its-complicated/	2024-10-07T09:17:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/upd_GettyImages-2175288947.jpg
Ukrainian intelligence evacuates naval officer's family from Crimea, Navy says	The Angels special intelligence unit has evacuated from occupied Crimea the family of a Ukrainian naval officer persecuted by Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB), the Navy reported on Oct. 7. The operation was ordered by Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa. It was secretly planned in a short time frame and &quot;successfully implemented,&quot; according to the statement. The family of four &#x2014; the officer&apos;s parents, sister and niece &#x2014; were detained in Russian-occupied Crimea on Sept. 18. &quot;They were illegally held for three days, psychologically pressured and threatened with torture,&quot; the Navy said. &quot;In this way, the occupiers planned to persuade the Ukrainian officer to cooperate.&quot; The family was released on Sept. 20 on the condition that the officer would contact the FSB within five days. Otherwise, the family could face &quot;years of imprisonment.&quot; &quot;The family was evacuated right from under the noses of the occupiers,&quot; the Navy added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/pursued-by-the-russian-fsb/	2024-10-07T08:16:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/ka4ymo---c16x9x50px50p--7fa6115eff1953781019dae79856b73d.webp
Russian attack on Odesa Oblast damages civilian vessel	Russian forces attacked the Paresa, a civilian cargo ship flying the flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis, in Odesa Oblast overnight on Oct. 6, according to Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. The vessel, loaded with about 6,000 tons of Ukrainian corn intended for export, was damaged at the Pivdennyi Port, according to Kuleba. Kyiv was forced to set up a new export route in the Black Sea last year after Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route. Russia launched a missile and drone attack on Odesa Oblast overnight, damaging a cargo ship in the region overnight on Oct. 6, 2024. (Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority)There were 15 people on board, including Egyptian and Syrian citizens. No casualties were reported. Traveling along the route, Ukrainian ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. A Russian missile struck a cargo ship carrying Ukrainian wheat to Egypt through the Black Sea on Sept. 12. The vessel was sailing through Romania&apos;s exclusive economic zone at the time. Despite Russian attacks, Ukraine has exported over 73 million metric tons of goods to multiple African, Asian and European countries for more than a year of operation, Kuleba said. &quot;Ukraine remains a guarantor of food and, consequently, social security for many countries around the world. Thanks to the humanitarian initiatives of our country, millions of people receive the necessary food,&quot; the minister added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-odesa-oblast-damages-saint-kitts-and-nevis-flagged-vessel/	2024-10-07T07:16:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/462195988_834319535541859_4905573654116758528_n.jpg
Pope appoints Ukrainian bishop to College of Cardinals	Pope Francis announced the appointment of the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Australia, Bishop Mykola Bychok, to the College of Cardinals on Oct. 6. This increased the number of College members to 142 from the usual cap of 120. The main responsibility of the College of Cardinals is to elect the new pope during a process called the conclave. When inaugurated, Ukraine-born Bishop Mykola Bychok will be one of the youngest members of the College and the only cardinal from the country. Aged 44, he will have the opportunity to sway influence in the College for decades to come. Alongside Bychok, the pope also nominated 20 other new members to the College, whose inauguration will be on Dec. 8. Most new members are from Pope Francis&#x2019; home continent of South America, with one from North America. New members also span Asia and Africa to represent the Church&#x2019;s periphery, a recurring motif in Pope Francis&#x2019; pontificate. Although he did not nominate the Kyiv-based head of Ukraine&#x2019;s Greek Catholic Church, analysts say his decision reflects a subtle political message as Ukraine prepares for its hardest winter since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Greek Catholicism is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest Christian denomination. Prevalent mainly in the western part of the country, less than one-tenth of the population are adherents of the Greek Catholic Church. While under the pope&apos;s jurisdiction, it has retained many rituals and practices shared with Orthodox Christians.	https://kyivindependent.com/pope-appoints-greek-catholic-bishop-as-only-cardinal-from-ukraine/	2024-10-07T06:16:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1580497031.jpeg
Russian Baltic Sea Fleet vessel out of action after Ukraine's sabotage, intelligence says	The Russian Baltic Fleet minesweeper Alexander Obukhov was put out of action thanks to a sabotage operation by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the agency said on Oct. 7. The ship, based in the Russian coastal town of Baltiysk in the Kaliningrad exclave, reportedly &quot;suffered severe damage&quot; after water leaked into the engine due to &quot;the mysterious appearance of a hole in a gas duct.&quot; This is the second case of Ukraine sabotaging a Russian warship in the exclave, which lies between Poland and Lithuania some 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s northwestern border. The vessel that was supposed to be sent on duty is now undergoing major repairs, as the damaged M-503 engine is a rare piece of equipment, the agency noted. Efforts to fix the vessel are likely to be &quot;technically difficult and expensive,&quot; according to HUR. The agency published a video supposedly from inside the Russian vessel, where an unidentified person shows and describes the aftermath of the sabotage, putting the date as Sept. 30. HUR did not specify how it gained access to the vessel to carry out the sabotage. 0:00/1&#xD7;In another incident on April 8, the Russian missile ship Serpukhov was set on fire while docked off the Kaliningrad exclave. Ukraine later revealed that a then-active member of the Russian Armed Forces assisted with the sabotage operation. Kyiv&apos;s forces also managed to disable roughly one-third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet with drone and missile attacks, undermining Russia&apos;s naval dominance in the sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-says-it-sabotaged-russian-baltic-sea-fleet-vessel/	2024-10-07T05:55:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Alexander-Obukhov.jpg
Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada restricts use of Telegram for parliament officials	Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada banned the use of the communication app Telegram for its officials on their work devices, MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn said on Oct. 7 in a Facebook post. Lawmakers and parliament officials will be barred from installing Telegram on work devices and will have to use two-factor authentication and other security measures when using the app for other purposes. The measure was recommended by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council amid worries that the messaging app, founded by Russian businessman Pavel Durov, represents a danger to national security. &quot;I think that such security measures are quite logical. Unfortunately, there have already been examples of third parties obtaining data on state employees through Telegram,&quot; Yurchyshyn said. The decision comes after Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk warned of fake messages sent from his Telegram account that he had not used for more than three years. Lawmakers will be allowed to keep using Telegram for personal communication on their personal devices. The popularity of Telegram in Ukraine skyrocketed after the start of the invasion in 2022, particularly due to its anonymous channels that mass-spread content to subscribers while preserving the full anonymity of the publisher.Telegram CEO and co-founder Durov was briefly detained in France and later charged with &quot;complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group&quot; and other crimes. Russian-born Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but on Aug. 27, it was reported he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-verkhovna-rada-restricts-use-of-telegram-for-parliament-officials/	2024-10-07T05:28:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1316489069.jpg
Ukraine's 3rd Brigade frees captured soldiers in Kharkiv Oblast skirmish	Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Assault Brigade managed to regain positions and free a group of captive Ukrainian soldiers during an engagement with a Russian sabotage group in Kharkiv Oblast, the unit said on Oct. 7. This comes as a confirmation of an Oct. 5 report about a skirmish in the Lyman direction in the northeast, close to the administrative border between Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv oblasts. The elite 3rd Brigade has been holding the line near the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast, repelling repeated Russian assaults. According to the Tactical Group Kreminna&apos;s statement, four soldiers from units assigned under the 3rd Brigade&apos;s command were captured by a Russian sabotage group numbering up to 10 fighters. After noticing their absence and spotting the Russian unit&apos;s movement with a drone, one of the 3rd Brigade&apos;s battalions dispatched a force in an M113 armored car to intercept them. The soldiers of the 3rd Brigade engaged the Russian sabotage group, allowing the captives to escape and return to Ukrainian positions. With Moscow&apos;s troops pushed back, the 3rd Brigade even regained lost territory. In August, the brigade launched a successful counterattack in Kharkiv Oblast, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-3rd-brigade-frees-captured-soldiers/	2024-10-07T04:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/3rd-Brigade.jpg
Ukraine's 72nd Brigade that defended Vuhledar has new commander	Colonel Oleksandr Okhrimenko was appointed the new commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, replacing his predecessor Ivan Vinnik, the unit said on Oct. 7. Okhrimenko, who previously headed the 14th Mechanized Brigade and the Odesa Oblast enlistment office, took over shortly after the 72nd Brigade was forced to withdraw from the key front-line town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;We have been hardened by Donbas. Battles for Bakhmut, Pavlivka, Vuhledar, Mykilske, Novomykhailivka, Vodiane. Vuhledar again... The enemy did not break us during this period,&quot; the unit said on Facebook. After withdrawing from the town, the 72nd Brigade&apos;s troops moved to a new defense line to continue holding back Russian forces, Arsenii Prylepko, a spokesperson for the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Hromadske. &quot;The &apos;Black Zaporizhzhians&apos; will be led to battle by Colonel Oleksandr Okhrimenko. New goals, tasks, purpose, and acquisition of new capabilities.&quot; Okhrimenko has been taking part in the war with Russia since the outbreak of hostilities in Donbas in 2014, receiving numerous awards for his service. While in command of the 14th Mechanized Brigade at the start of the full-scale invasion, Okhrimenko led his unit in battles in Kyiv, Mykolaiv, and Kharkiv oblasts, as well as Donbas. Okhrimenko was appointed to lead the regional enlistment office in Odesa in July 2023 after its chief, Yevhen Borisov, was dismissed and detained over a scandal related to the acquisition of a vast property in Spain. Vinnik&apos;s dismissal from command was announced in late September while the battle for Vuhledar was still ongoing. The decision was officially presented as a promotion to a higher post that would allow him to &quot;transfer combat experience.&quot; Vinnik was appointed commander of the 72nd Brigade in August 2022. Under his command, the brigade has defended Vuhledar for more than two years. Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;Thank you for the stability, strength, will, wisdom, and love for the staff! Good luck and victories on your new path, Colonel!&quot; the unit told Vinnik in a message on Facebook. Lawmaker and former member of the parliamentary defense committee Mariana Bezuhla criticized Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi over the change, saying Vinnik&apos;s dismissal threatened the brigade&apos;s combat effectiveness. The central figure of many controversies, Bezuhla is known for inflammatory comments toward the Armed Forces that put her at odds with her fellow lawmakers and members of the military.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-72nd-brigade-new-commander/	2024-10-07T04:02:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/72-commander.jpg
Russian airstrike against Kherson injures at least 11, including children	At least 11 people were injured during a Russian airstrike against the southern city of Kherson on Oct. 7, local authorities reported. Russia attacked the city around 10:40 a.m., with two KAB bombs dropped in the coastal area of the central district and two more in the northern part of Kherson. Initially, eight people were reported as injured, including two children aged three and five. Three more injuries were confirmed later during the same day. Two women went to the hospital themselves, while the third person was transported by ambulance, said Roman Mrochko, the head of the city&apos;s military administration. At least six multi-story buildings were damaged by blast waves, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. The same morning, Russia launched two Kinzhal missiles against Kyiv Oblast, both of which were shot down. The fallen debris damaged several buildings and cars in the city, but no casualties were reported. Ukraine liberated the southern city of Kherson from Russian occupation in November 2022. Since then, Russian troops have regularly attacked the city and nearby areas along the western bank of the Dnipro River.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-airstrike-against-kherson/	2024-10-07T03:18:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson.jpeg
North Korea warns NATO of 'tragic consequences' after Russia ties criticism	North Korea rejected NATO&apos;s criticism of its cooperation with Russia and threatened the alliance with &quot;tragic consequences,&quot; the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 6. NATO accused North Korea and Iran of &quot;fueling&quot; the war against Ukraine by giving missiles, shells, and drones to Russia in a statement issued last week. &quot;NATO in its recent statement let loose a string of extremely unreasonable remarks that it condemns&#x2026; the independent cooperative relations between sovereign states including the DPRK,&quot; the statement read. DPRK is North Korea&apos;s official name, the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea. &quot;If NATO continues to try hard to infringe upon the dignity, sovereignty, security, and interests of the DPRK&#x2026; NATO blindly following the U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the tragic consequences to be entailed by it,&quot; it added. North Korea began supplying Russia with artillery shells, possibly as early as mid-2022, to help it sustain its offensive in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s military strategy requires large quantities of artillery shells fired to destroy the opponent&apos;s positions or prepare ground assaults. More extensive ammunition supplies were confirmed by U.S. and South Korean intelligence in October 2023 following a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The shipments of artillery shells were followed by ballistic missiles, both of which have been deployed against Ukraine. Despite ramping up its domestic production, Russia still lacks the capacity to sustain these barrages alone. North Korean deliveries are helping to bridge the period until their factories gear up. Half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea, The Times reported on Oct. 4, citing Western intelligence sources. The two countries also signed a mutual defense pact during Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-warns-nato-of-tragic-consequences/	2024-10-07T03:05:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg
Russian strike on infrastructure facilities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast injures 3	Russian attack against the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and the region injured three employees of targeted infrastructure facilities, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on Oct. 7. The announcement comes after multiple warnings in the morning about a threat of Russian guided aerial bombs and ballistic and cruise missiles. No further details on the targeted facilities or the extent of damage have been provided. The same morning, Russia launched two Kinzhal missiles against Kyiv Oblast, both of which were shot down. The fallen debris damaged several buildings and cars in the city, but no casualties were reported. A third Kinzhal missile hit the area of the Starokostiantyniv airbase in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, the Air Force said. No casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure were reported. Ukraine does not usually comment on possible damage to military facilities. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-zaporizhzhia/	2024-10-07T02:44:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1768061719.jpeg
Putin greeted as 'Tsar' on his birthday by influential far-right ideologue	Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted by the hail &quot;God save the Tsar&quot; on the occasion of his 72nd birthday by ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin on his Telegram channel just minutes after midnight on Oct. 7. Dugin, a fervent supporter of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has long been an advocate of Russian imperialism and a leading figure of Russia&apos;s turn toward hardline nationalism and authoritarian rule. The ideologue also wished for &quot;angels&quot; to &quot;crown&quot; Putin with a golden wreath in his message on Telegram &#x2013; followed by more than 71,000 &#x2013; and called Putin&apos;s age of 72 the beginning of a &quot;second youth.&quot; Dugin became widely known after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was justified partly by some of his earlier works on Russia&#x2019;s superiority and its mission to create a &quot;Eurasian Union,&quot; a plan for the integration of Russia with the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. In August 2022, he lost his daughter in a car explosion that was most likely intended to target him. Dugin is also a suspect and wanted in Ukraine under the articles of genocide and encroachment on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. If he completes his term, Putin will become the longest-serving ruler of his country in more than 200 years after winning elections earlier this year with more than 85% of the votes in a vote largely seen as rigged. His election came without serious competition as his main political opponent, Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running in the race, died in a prison colony due to possible poisoning weeks before election day.	https://kyivindependent.com/dugin-putin-birthday/	2024-10-07T02:10:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169947960-1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 33 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 33 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 7. Ukrainian air defenses shot down two Kinhzhal missiles launched against Kyiv Oblast and 32 attack drones across various regions, the Air Force said. Russia reportedly attacked Ukraine with 80 projectiles, including an Iskander-M ballistic missile, a guided Kh-59 missile, and one more missile of an unknown type. Russia launched the Kinzhal missile strike against Kyiv on the morning of Oct. 7, the city&apos;s authorities reported. All the missiles were intercepted, with debris falling in three districts, starting a fire, and damaging the roof of a multi-story building and of a supermarket. No casualties were reported. A third Kinzhal missile hit the area of the Starokostiantyniv airbase in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, the Air Force said. No casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure were reported. Ukraine does not usually comment on possible damage to military facilities. Four people were injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Three residents were wounded during a Russian rocket strike against the Synelnykove district, which also damaged houses, a car, a garage of an agricultural company, and other property. A 45-year-old man was hospitalized with blast injuries as a result of a drone impact in the field during harvest. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed three people and injured 12 over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. One civilian was killed and two injured during an airstrike against the town of Kostiantynivka that damaged two high-rise buildings, a shop, a coffee shop, a bank, a post office, and an administrative building. One person was killed and one injured in the town of Chasiv Yar, and the same casualty figures were reported in the village of Illinka. Three injuries were reported in Bilenke, and one each in Toretsk, Serebrianka, Shevchenko, Izmailivka, and Shakhtarske. In Kharkiv Oblast, one person was killed and seven injured over the past day, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. The fatality &#x2013; a 57-year-old man &#x2013; was reported following a drone attack against the village of Pershotravneve.

Opinion: With elections ahead, Georgia stands between Russia and the West	Two years ago, a Georgian pro-Kremlin fringe channel aired a fabricated story featuring photoshopped images of several NGO representatives, including myself, in handcuffs at a fictional trial. This scenario, supposedly the result of a meeting between then-Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and Russian President Vladimir Putin, was laughable at the time &#x2013; a case of wishful thinking by pro-Kremlin actors. The current situation in Georgia is no longer a joke. The West&#x2019;s first wake-up call came when the Georgian government decided to reintroduce the so-called &#x201C;foreign agents&#x201D; law, inspired by the Kremlin and copied from Moscow, just ahead of the upcoming October parliamentary elections. Some foreign diplomats were genuinely surprised by this sudden shift, which deepened societal divisions and began to lead Georgia toward isolation from the West. The ruling Georgian Dream party&#x2019;s actions were increasingly perceived as a direct threat to the country&#x2019;s Euro-Atlantic integration. Like a Potemkin village, the Georgian government, de-facto led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has long played a double game &#x2013; presenting itself as committed to the Euro-Atlantic path to the outside world, while crafting a different narrative at home, avoiding any mention of Kremlin-related threats to consolidate public opinion. However, after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Georgian Dream party became more openly anti-Western, aligning its rhetoric with pro-Kremlin parties like the Conservative Movement/Alt-Info and Alliance of Patriots Georgia. The reasons behind this transformation aren&#x2019;t surprising to local watchdog organizations, who have long tracked the party&#x2019;s duplicitous behavior. Ivanishvili, like other autocrats, sees democracy as a threat. His government has focused its resources on dismantling key democratic institutions &#x2013; media, NGOs, and the political opposition &#x2013; by branding them as national traitors and enemies, a tactic reminiscent of Stalinist repression. A year ago, the Media Development Foundation (MDF) screened &#x201C;Putin&#x2019;s Kiss,&#x201D; a documentary about Russian youth activist Masha Drokova, who once collaborated with the radical youth movement Nashi, founded in Russia in 2005. The film caused a stir within Georgia&#x2019;s liberal circles. Some optimists questioned whether Georgia would ever experience such government-supported oppression.

(Thierry Tronnel/Corbis via Getty Images)Soon after, we witnessed alarming changes: Georgia, once an EU candidate country, began to resemble Putin&#x2019;s Russia. Russian-style vandalism occurred near our offices, though the Georgian perpetrators hid behind masks, unlike their Russian counterparts. Like in Russia, the Georgian government uses the notion of &#x201C;sovereign democracy,&#x201D; a concept invented by Putin&#x2019;s advisor, Vladislav Surkov, to undermine the liberal world order. This ideology holds that anyone questioning Russia&#x2019;s democracy is meddling in its internal affairs. In Georgia, the ruling party and pro-Kremlin actors have repurposed this idea, arguing that Western criticism of Georgia&#x2019;s democratic backsliding amounts to interference in the country&#x2019;s sovereignty &#x2013; suggesting Tbilisi doesn&#x2019;t need another Moscow dictating its actions. Georgian Dream even exploited the suffering of the Ukrainian people amid Russia&#x2019;s war for political gain. An outdoor campaign juxtaposing Ukraine&#x2019;s war-torn destruction with the &#x201C;peace&#x201D; offered by Georgian Dream sparked outrage, being denounced by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and criticized by Georgian President Salome Zourabishvili. In 2012, the Georgian Dream&#x2019;s manifesto explicitly stated that Georgia would no longer be a point of contention between the West and Russia. To avoid provoking Russia, Georgian officials avoided mentioning the Kremlin as a security threat. But by 2022, the ruling party and its allies were openly accusing Georgia&#x2019;s Western partners of trying to drag the country into war and open a second front. This shift in rhetoric leaves Georgians unsure who poses the greater threat &#x2013; Russia, which occupies 20% of their country, or the West. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently offered to help Georgia &#x201C;normalize relations&#x201D; with its neighboring &#x201C;states&#x201D; (meaning Georgia&#x2019;s Russian-occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia). This controversial offer, welcomed by the ruling party, could serve as a lifeline for Georgian Dream ahead of the elections. While Russia has no intention of restoring Georgia&#x2019;s territorial integrity, it does want to keep the current government in power. That&#x2019;s why the upcoming elections are so crucial &#x2013; will Georgia continue moving toward the West, or will Ivanishvili lead the country deeper into the &#x201C;Russian World&#x201D; and further isolate the West?

PM Shmyhal meets Slovak counterpart Fico near Ukraine's Uzhhorod	Ukrainian and Slovak prime ministers Denys Shmyhal and Robert Fico began their meeting near the western Ukrainian border city of Uzhhorod on Oct. 7, Ukrinform reported. The two heads of government will discuss cooperation in energy security and infrastructure projects. The meeting comes shortly after Fico&apos;s comments that as long as he is the prime minister, he will block Kyiv&apos;s entry into NATO. &quot;This is something that I have openly told Prime Minister Shmyhal, the Americans, and everyone else. As long as I am head of the Slovak government, I will direct the lawmakers under my control as chairman of the (ruling Smer) party never to agree to Ukraine joining NATO,&quot; Fico told Slovak media. Ukraine applied for membership in September 2022 in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion but has yet to receive an invitation. The step would require a unanimous agreement of all the 32 members. &quot;It would only create a basis for World War III. Because ... once Ukraine is a NATO member and a conflict similar to the current one breaks out, it will count as an attack on a NATO member, and some extremely dangerous mechanisms can be triggered,&quot; Fico said, reiterating his previously voiced positions. Since returning to office in October 2023 after winning the Slovak parliamentary elections on a populist platform, Fico has sharply criticized military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. This represented a sharp shift away from the previous government&apos;s policy, which supplied Kyiv with extensive arms supplies, including Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets. In turn, the Slovak prime minister spoke in support of Ukraine&apos;s EU membership and largely avoided breaking Western consensus in major decisions on support for Ukraine. Last week, Fico also said he would visit Moscow next year for the 80th anniversary celebrations of the end of World War II. While the Slovak prime minister claimed the visit would not be connected to Russia&apos;s war, the Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might. &quot;Next year will be the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Who will stop me from going to a peace rally in Moscow?&#x201D; he asked. &quot;Why shouldn&apos;t I go? What does it have to do with the present?&quot; Fico previously met Shmyhal in Uzhhorod in January, during which both leaders signed a joint statement on bilateral relations.	https://kyivindependent.com/shmyhal-fico-meeting/	2024-10-07T00:50:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2147048596.jpg
Infamous Russian arms dealer preparing deal with Yemen's Houthis, WSJ reports	Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout is suspected to be preparing a small arms deal with Yemen&apos;s Iran-backed Houthi militants, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 6. Viktor Bout gained fame in 2005 after a movie titled &quot;Lord of War,&quot; allegedly portraying his life of selling weapons for decades to Middle Eastern, South American, and African clients before he was arrested in 2008 and imprisoned in the U.S. The arms dealer was released almost two years ago in a prisoner exchange with Russia for U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner. He is suspected of being in talks with the Houthi militia after they went to Moscow in August to negotiate the purchase of $10 million worth of automatic weapons. If finalized, this deal would be his first arms shipment after imprisonment but would not include anti-ship or anti-air missiles that could pose a threat to the U.S. military&apos;s efforts to protect international shipping from the Houthis&apos; attacks, the WSJ wrote. Tehran, which has deepened ties with Moscow and provided Russia with drones and ballistic missiles for use against Ukraine, has been mediating a deal for the supply of Russian supersonic &#xA0;Yakhont (Onyx) missiles to Houthis, Reuters previously reported. Yemen&apos;s Houthis are an Iran-backed, Muslim political and religious group designated as terrorists by the U.S. The group fought in Yemen&apos;s decade-long civil war and began attacking cargo ships a year ago in the Red Sea as a response to Israel&#x2019;s military operation in the Gaza Strip.	https://kyivindependent.com/infamous-russian-arms-dealer-back-in-business-wsj-reports/	2024-10-06T23:25:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-82083347.jpg
Missile debris falls in Kyiv following Kinzhal strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Missile debris fell in Ukraine&apos;s capital following explosions and a nationwide air raid alert on the morning of Oct. 7, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Explosions were heard in Kyiv at around 8:30 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent reporters. Municipal authorities reported active air defenses in the city around the same time. The debris was found in the Solomianskyi and Holosiivskyi districts of the city. No casualties or damage were reported at the time of the publication. The explosions sounded shortly after Russian forces lifted MiG-31 attack jets, launching Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The Air Force detected the missiles flying toward Kyiv and Starokostiantyniv in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, where a major airbase is located. All missiles targeting Kyiv have been intercepted, the Kyiv city military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/missile-debris-falls-in-kyiv/	2024-10-06T23:06:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1393468211.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 661,630 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 661,630 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 7. This number includes 1,160 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,933 tanks, 17,710 armored fighting vehicles, 26,102 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,156 artillery systems, 1,223 multiple launch rocket systems, 972 air defense systems, 368 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,643 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-661-630-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-06T22:23:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1785368869.jpg
Oil depot on fire in Crimea's Feodosia following drone attack	A fire erupted at an oil depot in Russia-occupied Feodosia in the early hours of Oct. 7, reportedly following a drone attack, according to Russian media. Residents reported hearing several powerful explosions around 4:30 a.m. local time, shortly before the fire started. The Crimean Wind Telegram channel also reported that airfields in Belbek and Saky were attacked overnight. Local authorities confirmed the incident but described it as a fire. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Russia&apos;s claims. &quot;There&#x2019;s a fire at the Feodosia oil depot. Emergency services are on the scene. No casualties or injuries have been reported,&quot; Oleg Kryuchkov, advisor to the Russia-installed proxy head of Crimea, said on Telegram. The Telegram channel ASTRA later clarified that the facility on fire was the Marine Oil Terminal, previously targeted by drones in March 2024. At that time, four drones struck the depot, damaging the main fuel pipeline and causing a fire, which took over an hour to extinguish. The Feodosia terminal is the largest in Crimea for handling oil products, with only one other terminal of its kind located in Sevastopol. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-on-fire-in-crimeas-feodosia-following-drone-attack/	2024-10-06T20:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-04-083245.jpg
Netherlands pledges 400 million for Ukraine drone initiative	During an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Oct. 6, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced that the Netherlands will invest 400 million euros ($440 million) in a joint advanced drone development initiative with Ukraine. He also confirmed that additional F-16 fighter jets will be delivered to Ukraine in the coming months. As Ukraine faces continued pressure from Russian forces in the east and increased attacks on critical infrastructure ahead of winter, this support comes at a crucial time, more than two and a half years into the war. The initiative will focus on a range of drones, including surveillance, defensive, and offensive types. &quot;We will focus on different types of drones, so both surveillance drones, more defensive drones, but also the attack drones, because we see that Ukraine needs those more offensive drones also to target military facilities,&quot; Brekelmans explained, according to Reuters. About half of the investment will remain in the Netherlands, with the remainder distributed between Ukraine and other countries. If the project proves successful, additional funds could be allocated to scale up production. Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, the Netherlands has committed 10 billion euros ($11.1 billion) in military aid to Ukraine, with four billion already spent.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-pledges-400-million-for-ukraine-drone-initiative/	2024-10-06T19:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2059253115.jpg
Zelensky: Kursk operation has made one of the biggest contributions to Ukraine's exchange fund	President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Kursk operation has made one of the most significant contributions to Ukraine&apos;s exchange fund, aiding the release of Ukrainians from captivity. &quot;Today marks two months of our military operations in the Kursk region. And this is a very important phase of the war. Something that has greatly helped and continues to help our country,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address published on Oct. 6. Ukraine started its offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements since then. &quot;Ukrainians have proven that they can push the war into Russia. And with sufficient support from our partners, we will be able to put pressure on Russia in the way that&#x2019;s necessary for Russia to realize that the war will gain them nothing,&quot; he added. The offensive involved approximately 15,000 Ukrainian troops who occupied about 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in the Kursk region. Ukrainian forces also captured hundreds of Russian soldiers. This incursion represents the largest offensive into Russian soil since World War II. &quot;We will continue to apply even greater pressure on Russia &#x2013; because only through strength can we bring peace closer,&quot; Zelensky concluded. The Kursk region lies on the border with Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast, which has been experiencing daily attacks since Russian troops were pushed out of the oblast and back across the border in April 2022. Sumy Oblast and the Kursk region share a 245-kilometer (152-mile) border.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-kursk-operation-has-made-one-of-the-biggest-contributions-to-ukraines-exchange-fund/	2024-10-06T17:26:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2156549690.jpg
Russian opposition activist killed in Kharkiv Oblast, while fighting for Ukraine	Russian opposition activist Ildar Dadin, who had joined Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces, was reportedly killed in battle in the Kharkiv region, according to former Echo of Moscow journalist Ksenia Larina. Larina shared the news on social media, citing information from a fellow soldier, Igor Volobuyev, who heard it from Dadin&apos;s brothers. Dadin was the first person convicted under Article 212.1 of the Russian Criminal Code for &quot;repeatedly violating the rules for organizing or holding protests, rallies, demonstrations, marches, or pickets.&quot; This law later became informally known as the &quot;Dadin Article.&quot; After serving more than two years in prison and undergoing torture throughout his time there, Dadin joined Ukraine&apos;s forces against Russia in 2023, serving first in the Siberian Battalion and later in the Freedom of Russia legion. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence spokesman Andrii Yusov previously said that these militias, (also including the Russian Volunteer Corps), are comprised of Russian citizens who are part of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;defense and security forces&#x201D; but stressed that their incursions into Russia are not taking place under Kyiv&apos;s orders. &quot;On the territory of the Russian Federation, they act absolutely autonomously, on their own, and pursue their social and political program tasks,&quot; Yusov told the media. Kyrylo Budanov, the military intelligence chief, said that anti-Kremlin militias had been helping Ukraine from the very beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, and Ukrainian forces would try to support them as well &quot;to the extent possible.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-opposition-activist-killed-in-kharkiv-oblast-while-fighting-for-ukraine/	2024-10-06T14:41:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/dadin.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv braces for Russian push near Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast	Key developments on Oct. 6: Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the coming days, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 5. This comes as another warning of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;If they achieve a breakthrough, Russia will be able to fire at logistical routes connecting Zaporizhzhia to the east of Ukraine,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Russia will try to succeed at any cost to cut off our logistics.&quot; Ukrainian intelligence shows that Russian forces are amassing personnel and logistical support in the area, and &quot;in a few days, they will likely start new offensive operations,&quot; the spokesperson noted. Voloshyn expects Russia to deploy small assault groups backed by armored vehicles. Orikhiv is a Ukrainian-held town roughly 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhziha, and roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the front line. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Russia intensified its attacks in the south earlier this year, claiming to recapture Robotyne. Ukraine has repeatedly denied this claim. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) unit Kryla (&quot;Wings&quot;) destroyed a Russian air defense system Osa with a first-person view (FPV) drone, the agency said on Oct. 6. A drone worth &quot;several hundred dollars&quot; was used to destroy an automated air defense system worth $10 million, the intelligence agency noted. Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. HUR released a video showing footage of the FPV drone ramming into the Russian weapon system and then separate drone footage of the burning equipment. HUR released a video showing footage of the FPV drone ramming into the Russian weapon system and then separate drone footage of the burning equipment. The agency did not provide any further details, including when or where did the strike take place. Russia has lost 970 air defense systems since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said earlier on Oct. 6 before the military intelligence agency&apos;s announcement. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently.

Ukraine may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the upcoming Ramstein summit, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 6, citing an undisclosed diplomat. Kyiv hopes to secure additional pledges of assistance during the conference on Oct. 12, which will be the last gathering in this format before the U.S. presidential election in early November. There are concerns that a return of Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House could spell a reduction of military aid to Ukraine and an obstacle to the country&apos;s NATO aspirations. According to the diplomat quoted by the WP, NATO members are considering a more definitive proposal regarding the accession, but it will likely fall short of what Kyiv has asked for. Despite a pledge at the NATO summit in Washington that its membership path is &quot;irreversible,&quot; Ukraine is yet to receive a definitive invitation. Kyiv revealed that an alliance membership is a key part of a victory plan President Volodymyr Zelensky pitched to the U.S. leadership in September. Zelensky will again present the plan, in which Washington identified &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; to the other allies at the Ramstein summit. During his U.S. trip, the Ukrainian president also lobbied for lifting restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia with Western arms, but no such decision has been made so far. In spite of this, the diplomat told the WP that Kyiv may receive some sort of support during the Ramstein meeting later this month. Lithuanian customs officers discovered military uniforms and camouflage nets on passenger trains traveling from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to Moscow, the Delfi outlet reported on Oct. 5. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small but heavily armed territory lodged between the Baltic Sea and NATO members Poland and Lithuania. Lithuanian authorities are regulating the railway connection segment that runs through their territory and connects the exclave to Belarus and Russia. During inspections, Lithuanian authorities intercepted four shipments of various military items loaded onto passenger trains between Sept. 27 and Oct. 2, Delfi wrote. The shipments included five pairs of military camouflage trousers and several camouflage nets for masking weapons, which were found at the Kybartai train station near the exclave&apos;s border. Vilnius believes that the shipments were intended for use by the Russian Armed Forces deployed in Ukraine. The items will be sent to Ukraine as military aid. Vilnius has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war, leading to the sharp deterioration of relations with Moscow. Another incident on the Kaliningrad-Moscow railway occurred last week. One carriage of a train that arrived at the Kena checkpoint at the Lithuanian-Belarusian borders displayed the letter Z, a symbol commonly used by Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Another carriage displayed an inscription calling Vilnius, Lithuania&apos;s capital, a &quot;Russian city.&quot; The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania along with other Baltic countries in World War II, with the nation declaring independence only in 1990.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-braces-for-russian-push-near-orikhiv-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2024-10-06T12:15:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1733436357.jpg
Dutch Defense Minister visits Kharkiv, reiterates support for Ukraine	Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Breckelmans made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Oct. 6, and visited Kharkiv. On his social media, Breckelmans highlighted the city&apos;s proximity to the Russian border and posted photos to show the devastation caused by Russia&#x2019;s attacks. &#x201C;I have seen the consequences of devastating Russian shelling. Destroyed apartments. Power outages. How children study in bunkers,&#x201D; he wrote on X. Breckelmans stressed that Ukraine can only protect itself by keeping Russia at a greater distance. His visit to Kharkiv follows an earlier trip to Odesa after his appointment as defense minister. The Netherlands has already supplied Ukraine with a radar system for the Patriot air defense system, and plans to send three launchers soon. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-defense-minister-visits-kharkiv-reiterates-support-for-ukraine/	2024-10-06T12:05:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/dutch.jpg
NATO to expand military forces and air defense due to increased threats, Die Welt reports	NATO has been advised to significantly bolster its defense capabilities, as outlined in a report by German newspaper Die Welt. This includes increasing the number of combat brigades from 82 to 131 and creating new corps and divisions, raising their number from 24 to 38, to meet the minimum defense requirements. Additionally, NATO must rebuild its ground-based air defense and expand its air and transport capabilities. These recommendations were approved and signed by the Supreme Commander of NATO in Europe, Christopher J. Cavoli, and the head of the command for transformation, Pierre Vandieu, reflecting the urgent need for stronger collective security in light of growing global threats. On July 18, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that NATO allies must prepare for the worst-case scenario of a decade-long war in Ukraine. &quot;The main message is that the stronger the support for Ukraine and the longer we are willing to commit, the sooner this war can end,&quot; Stoltenberg told the BBC. &quot;The paradox is that now (Russian) President Putin believes that he can wait us out. So therefore, the war continues.&quot; Stoltenberg, whose term as secretary general ends in October, has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance.	https://kyivindependent.com/die-welt-nato-to-expand-military-forces-and-air-defense-due-to-increased-threats/	2024-10-06T10:41:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg

Ukraine shows destruction of Russian Osa anti-aircraft system with FPV drone	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) unit Kryla (&quot;Wings&quot;) destroyed a Russian air defense system Osa with a first-person view (FPV) drone, the agency said on Oct. 6. A drone worth &quot;several hundred dollars&quot; was used to destroy an automated air defense system worth $10 million, the intelligence agency noted. Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. 0:00/1&#xD7;A Russian Osa anti-aircraft system was destroyed by Ukrainian FPV drones in an unknown location during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. A video published on Oct. 6, 2024. (HUR/Telegram)HUR released a video showing footage of the FPV drone ramming into the Russian weapon system and then separate drone footage of the burning equipment. The agency did not provide any further details, including when or where did the strike take place. Russia has lost 970 air defense systems since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said earlier on Oct. 6 before the military intelligence agency&apos;s announcement. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-shows-destruction-of-russian-osa-anti-aircraft-system/	2024-10-06T07:08:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Osa.jpg
Hungarians protest 'ruling party propaganda,' demand more media freedom	Thousands of Hungarians gathered in Budapest on Oct. 5 to demand greater press freedom and a halt to what they called a &quot;propaganda factory&quot; run by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s government. The protests, launched outside of the building of the state-owned MTVA media company, were organized by Hungary&apos;s leading opposition figure and head of the Tisza party, Peter Magyar. A former member of Orban&apos;s Fidesz party, Magyar has risen up as the prime minister&apos;s chief political rival, lambasting the incumbent government for corruption and cronyism. &quot;Repeat a lie enough times and people will believe it to be the truth. This is Adolf Hitler&apos;s advice to Fidesz, to the propaganda of the ruling party,&quot; the opposition leader told the crowd, according to Euronews. &quot;What is going on today in Hungary in 2024 under the name of public service is a global scandal.&quot; Press freedom organizations have lambasted Orban&apos;s government for building up a media empire within Hungary and exerting pressure on independent outlets. Reporters Without Borders said that public broadcasting &quot;was turned into a propaganda machine&quot; while &quot;several private media outlets were taken over or silenced.&quot; In its 2019 report, the European Federation of Journalists said that MTVA, the media company running several radio and TV channels, a news agency, and online news portals, has been &quot;deformed (from a public broadcaster) into a state broadcaster.&quot; The 16-point list of demands published by the Tisza party on Oct. 4 includes the resignation of MTVA&apos;s CEO, restoring political supervision over public media, and other steps supposedly aimed at transforming the broadcaster back into public service media. Budapest clashed with the EU over media freedom after European governments and the European Parliament agreed on a Media Freedom Act, which seeks to combat creeping government influence over the press. Brussels, which has frozen billions of euros of Hungary-bound funds over the rule of law issues, has also grown frustrated with Orban&apos;s consistent obstructions of sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine. Magyar visited Kyiv in July in the wake of a deadly Russian attack against the Okhmatdyt hospital, bringing humanitarian aid. In early June, Magyar said his party shares the position of the Hungarian government not to send the country&apos;s troops or weapons to Ukraine, but he affirmed Kyiv&apos;s right to self-defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarians-call-for-media-freedom/	2024-10-06T06:17:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Magyar-Peter.jpg
Vuhledar, Russia losses and Israel-Lebanon conflict | Ukraine This Week	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur explains the top stories of the week, from the fall of Vuhledar to the rising Russian casualties.

Lithuania confiscates military goods from Kaliningrad-Moscow trains, gives them to Ukraine	Lithuanian customs officers discovered military uniforms and camouflage nets on passenger trains traveling from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to Moscow, the Delfi outlet reported on Oct. 5. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small but heavily armed territory lodged between the Baltic Sea and NATO members Poland and Lithuania. Lithuanian authorities are regulating the railway connection segment that runs through their territory and connects the exclave to Belarus and Russia. During inspections, Lithuanian authorities intercepted four shipments of various military items loaded onto passenger trains between Sept. 27 and Oct. 2, Delfi wrote. The shipments included five pairs of military camouflage trousers and several camouflage nets for masking weapons, which were found at the Kybartai train station near the exclave&apos;s border. Vilnius believes that the shipments were intended for use by the Russian Armed Forces deployed in Ukraine. The items will be sent to Ukraine as military aid. Vilnius has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war, leading to the sharp deterioration of relations with Moscow. Another incident on the Kaliningrad-Moscow railway occurred last week. One carriage of a train that arrived at the Kena checkpoint at the Lithuanian-Belarusian borders displayed the letter Z, a symbol commonly used by Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Another carriage displayed an inscription calling Vilnius, Lithuania&apos;s capital, a &quot;Russian city.&quot; The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania along with other Baltic countries in World War II, with the nation declaring independence only in 1990.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-finds-military-supplies-on-kaliningrad-train/	2024-10-06T04:58:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/trousers.jpg
Ukrainian artifacts stolen by Russia appearing on black markets, Kyiv says	Some historical artifacts stolen by Russia in Ukraine have emerged on global black markets, Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin said in an interview with the Voice of America on Oct. 4. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by large-scale looting of cultural heritage in the occupied territories, with hundreds of artifacts recorded to be stolen. &quot;In addition to the systematic destruction of our cultural heritage, Russia resorts to another crime: stealing valuable cultural objects,&quot; Kostin said. &quot;These artifacts, stolen from our museums and archeological sites, are now appearing on black markets. We already have enough evidence to launch new criminal proceedings.&quot; Kostin said that Ukraine cooperated with the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI to collect the evidence. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has launched a new unit focused on investigating both the destruction of cultural heritage in war and any attempts at illegally selling the artifacts abroad. Ukraine&apos;s Culture Ministry said that almost 2,100 cultural establishments have been damaged or destroyed since the outbreak of the full-scale war as of Oct. 4, including 120 museums and galleries. Earlier this year, Kyiv managed to retrieve a set of Crimean artifacts known as the &quot;Scythian gold&quot; after a decade of legal struggle with Russian occupation authorities in the peninsula.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-artifacts-stolen-by-russia-appear-on-black-markets-kyiv-says/	2024-10-06T04:02:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
NATO considering 'concrete steps' on Ukraine's accession at Ramstein summit, WP reports	Ukraine may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the upcoming Ramstein summit, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 6, citing an undisclosed diplomat. Kyiv hopes to secure additional pledges of assistance during the conference on Oct. 12, which will be the last gathering in this format before the U.S. presidential election in early November. There are concerns that a return of Republican candidate Donald Trump to the White House could spell a reduction of military aid to Ukraine and an obstacle to the country&apos;s NATO aspirations. According to the diplomat quoted by the WP, NATO members are considering a more definitive proposal regarding the accession, but it will likely fall short of what Kyiv has asked for. Despite a pledge at the NATO summit in Washington that its membership path is &quot;irreversible,&quot; Ukraine is yet to receive a definitive invitation. Kyiv revealed that an alliance membership is a key part of a victory plan President Volodymyr Zelensky pitched to the U.S. leadership in September. Zelensky will again present the plan, in which Washington identified &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; to the other allies at the Ramstein summit. During his U.S. trip, the Ukrainian president also lobbied for lifting restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia with Western arms, but no such decision has been made so far. In spite of this, the diplomat told the WP that Kyiv may receive some sort of support during the Ramstein meeting later this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-nato-membership-ramstein-wp/	2024-10-06T03:12:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Ukraine braces for Russian push near Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in coming days	Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the coming days, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 5. This comes as another warning of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;If they achieve a breakthrough, Russia will be able to fire at logistical routes connecting Zaporizhzhia to the east of Ukraine,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Russia will try to succeed at any cost to cut off our logistics.&quot; Ukrainian intelligence shows that Russian forces are amassing personnel and logistical support in the area, and &quot;in a few days, they will likely start new offensive operations,&quot; the spokesperson noted. The estimated Russian advance near Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine, as of Oct. 5, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Voloshyn expects Russia to deploy small assault groups backed by armored vehicles. Orikhiv is a Ukrainian-held town roughly 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhziha, and roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the front line. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Russia intensified its attacks in the south earlier this year, claiming to recapture Robotyne. Ukraine has repeatedly denied this claim. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-braces-for-russian-push-near-orikhiv/	2024-10-06T02:16:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1706048431.jpg
Putin used then-President Trump's animus toward Ukraine to undermine US support, NYT reports	Donald Trump asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for advice when deciding on whether to send arms to Ukraine early during his presidency in 2017, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Oct. 5, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. Trump&apos;s views on Ukraine are causing concern among Kyiv&apos;s supporters as the ex-president seeks re-election this November, sparking fears of reduced military support amid the full-scale Russian invasion. At the start of Trump&apos;s term in office, the Kremlin&apos;s chief was aptly using Trump&apos;s prejudices against Ukraine to undermine Washington&apos;s support for Kyiv, the NYT wrote, citing memoir accounts, U.S. and European officials, and Trump&apos;s allies. Defeating his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in 2016, the Republican candidate reportedly entered office with a &quot;dim view&quot; of Ukraine, suspecting the country&apos;s leadership of favoring the Democrats. Putin used these views to try to shape Trump&apos;s overall stance on aiding Ukraine during their first face-to-face meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017, the NYT reported. Trump allegedly asked Putin what he thought about the possibility of sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine, which was at the time fighting Russian and Russian proxy forces in the eastern region of Donbas. The Russian president responded it would be a &quot;mistake,&quot; forcing Trump&apos;s team to come up with ways to &quot;change the president&apos;s mind on Ukraine&quot; after the meeting, according to the outlet. Nevertheless, during his presidential term of 2017-2021, Trump approved the first sale of Javelin anti-tank launchers to Ukraine. Trump&apos;s suspected animosity toward Ukraine was later linked to Kyiv&apos;s role in the first &#x2013; and unsuccessful &#x2013; impeachment against the U.S. president in 2019. The impeachment trial was centered around a phone call between Trump and Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the U.S. president was accused of withholding military aid to pressure Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden&apos;s son Hunter Biden. Trump&apos;s history with Ukraine can play a major role in his foreign policy should he return to the White House. The ex-president has promised to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine within a day if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. One plan reportedly involves ceding territory to Russia. Trump met Zelensky during the latter&apos;s visit to the U.S. at the end of September, during which he touted his supposed &quot;good relationship&quot; with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Repeating similar comments made at a joint press conference in advance of their meeting, Trump told the Washington Post that he liked Zelensky &quot;because during the impeachment hoax&#x2026;he could have said he didn&apos;t know the (conversation) was taped&#x2026;But instead of grandstanding and saying, &apos;Yes, I felt threatened,&apos; he said, &apos;He did absolutely nothing wrong.&apos;&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-zelensky-nyt/	2024-10-06T01:34:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810240458.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 30 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 30 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 6. Russia launched 87 Shahed-type drones, two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, one Iskander-K cruise missile, and one Kh-59/69 cruise missile against Ukraine overnight, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 56 drones, while 25 were lost on Ukrainian territory thanks to electronic warfare means. Two of the missiles were also intercepted. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv Oblast overnight, with an air raid alert being sounded three times and lasting five hours in total. All the drones detected over Kyiv and on approach to the capital were intercepted and destroyed, the city&apos;s military administration said. No damage or casualties were reported. Two people were injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. A 50-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man were injured on the evening of Oct. 5 in rocket attacks against the Synelnykove district. Several houses, cars, and a tractor were damaged. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and eight injured over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. An attack against Velyka Novosilka killed one person and injured another. The second fatality was reported in the town of Toretsk, and two people were wounded in Selydove and five in Kostiantynivka. A crash of a Russian aircraft in the town of Kostiantynivka damaged houses but resulted in no casualties. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 49-year-old man was killed when a Russian Lancet drone hit a car near the village of Nyzhche Solone at midday on Oct. 5, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. An 87-year-old man was reportedly injured during an airstrike against the same village later the same day. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast killed a 55-year-old man in the village of Velentenske and injured 15 other civilians across the region, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A gas pipeline, a bus, houses, a multi-story building, and other buildings and civilian property were damaged. Russia attacked the southern city of Odesa with drones overnight, injuring a man and damaging warehouses and trucks, the Interior Ministry said. In Sumy Oblast, three civilians were injured during a drone attack against a bus in the Richky community on Oct. 5, the regional military administration reported. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-94/	2024-10-06T00:15:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Odesa.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 660,470 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 660,470 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 6. This number includes over 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,919 tanks, 17,679 armored fighting vehicles, 26,006 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,092 artillery systems, 1,216 multiple launch rocket systems, 970 air defense systems, 368 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,578 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-660-470-troops-in-ukraine/	2024-10-05T23:14:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg
Russia's envoy to US concludes his term amid heightened bilateral tensions	Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, returned to Moscow on Oct. 5 as his term in Washington concluded, according to state media reports. Antonov&apos;s departure marks the end of his assignment during a period of increasingly hostile relations between the two nations, the worst in decades. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed the move, with state news agency TASS citing Antonov&apos;s return. The 69-year-old diplomat, known for his hardline stance, has been Russia&#x2019;s envoy to Washington since 2017. Throughout his tenure, Antonov was seen as a tough negotiator, particularly on military and strategic issues. There has been no announcement regarding his successor, Reuters reports. Antonov&#x2019;s support for President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s policies has been steadfast, aligning with Russia&#x2019;s framing of the full-scale invasion as a &quot;special military operation&quot; rather than a war, as described by Kyiv and its Western allies. During his career, Antonov served as deputy defense minister during Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and was subject to European sanctions after being appointed to Washington. Known for his skill as an arms control negotiator, he previously led Russian delegations to key international talks. Despite the current tensions, Antonov expressed openness to working with Washington on arms control in an August interview with TASS. &quot;My tactics for conducting negotiations are very simple: you and I need to take a piece of paper and write down what you want and what I want,&quot; he said, advocating for finding common ground, even on minimal terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-envoy-to-us-concludes-his-term-amid-heightened-bilateral-tensions/	2024-10-05T19:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1188494465.jpg
Russia struck passenger bus in Sumy Oblast, injuring 3	In the Richky community of Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy district, Russian forces used a drone to drop an explosive device on a passenger bus. The explosion injured three civilians and damaged the bus, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported on Oct. 5. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Over the past 24 hours, Russia struck 12 communities in Sumy Oblast in 61 separate attacks. The communities of Mykolaiv, Khotin, Myropillia, Bilopillia, Richkivka, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Nova Sloboda, Shalyhyne, Esman, Svesy, and Seredyna-Buda were targeted. At least 108 explosions were reported in the region. Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, artillery, guided bombs, and drones. Russia has intensified strikes against the region since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in early August. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s Kursk Oblast incursion has helped prevent the occupation of Sumy Oblast and its regional center, the city of Sumy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-struck-passenger-bus-in-sumy-oblast-injuring-3/	2024-10-05T16:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-05-18_45_14.jpeg
US Republican delegation visits Hungary, questions Orban's relations with Russia and China	After visiting Hungary from Oct. 3-5, five U.S. Republican senators voiced concerns about Hungary&apos;s growing ties with Russia and increasing cooperation with China. The delegation consisted of Republican senators Jerry Moren, John Boozman, Susan Collins, John Cornyn, and John Goven. U.S. Ambassador to Hungary David Pressman issued a statement quoting Senator Jerry Moren, who emphasized the delegation&apos;s worries about Hungary&apos;s expanding relations with Russia and the erosion of its democratic institutions. The statement also urged closer alignment between Hungary and its allies. &quot;It is in our common interests that our countries cooperate closely. We call on Hungary to listen to the allies&apos; warnings and respond to them,&quot; Hungary is widely regarded as a key ally of Russia in the EU. Orban has repeatedly blocked aid to Ukraine, pushed for negotiations, and frequently spouted Kremlin talking points. Hungary has also condemned the war but has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons. In July, he embarked on a &#x201C;peace tour&#x201D; and met with Russian President Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Orban&apos;s visits sparked criticism from the EU and President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-republican-delegation-visits-hungary-questions-orbans-relations-with-russia-and-china/	2024-10-05T11:40:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1611984653.jpg
Russian attack on Kherson injures 4	Russian forces carried out a drone attack in the Dripro district of Kherson on October 5, leaving four civilians injured, local authorities reported. A 55-year-old man and two women, aged 65 and 70, sustained blast and shrapnel injuries while they were outside during the attack. All were hospitalized for treatment, with further details currently unavailable. Later, it was reported that a 60-year-old man also suffered a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and is now under medical supervision. Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces liberated Kherson and other settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian troops were pushed to the river&apos;s east bank, from where they have since been firing at the liberated territories, regularly resulting in civilian deaths, as well as large-scale destruction of homes and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kherson-injures-4/	2024-10-05T09:50:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson-1.jpeg
Ukraine scrambles for resources before uncertain US elections	Kyiv&#x2019;s efforts to secure as many resources as possible from Western allies to tip the scale of Russia&apos;s war in its favor will face a critical moment next weekend as leaders of more than 50 countries meet for the final talks on arming Ukraine before the upcoming U.S. elections. &#x201C;This will be a special Ramstein,&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message this past week after returning from his U.S. trip, where he presented Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; to end the war. Zelensky said Kyiv expects &#x201C;concrete actions&#x201D; from its allies at the gathering, which brings together countries almost monthly to discuss and agree upon support for Ukraine. Among those actions is the lifting of restrictions on using Western-provided missiles and other weapons to strike targets deep in Russia &#x2014; so far, a red line the U.S. and other allies have been unwilling to cross, fearing escalation. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine hopes lifting the ban would be a wild card that could help it strike Russian military targets in the rear and, ultimately, grind down its combat capabilities from afar.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)As Kyiv pushes for further support, signs are emerging that Russia &#x2014; two and a half years into its full-scale invasion &#x2014; may be gradually exhausting its enormous Soviet-era arsenal. Western and Ukrainian analysts expect Moscow to struggle to conduct further high-loss offensive operations in the second half of 2025. Experts say Moscow has increasingly begun pulling out older and less favorable models &#x2013; a sign that it could be reaching closer to the bottom of the stockpile. But for now, time is still on Russia&#x2019;s side. &#x201C;Ukraine needs to strengthen its positions on the front line so that we can increase pressure on Russia for the sake of fair, real diplomacy,&#x201D; Zelensky said at an Oct. 3 press conference during the visit of newly-appointed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to Kyiv. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;This is why we need a sufficient quantity and quality of long-range weapons, the provision of which, in my opinion, is being delayed by our partners,&#x201D; Zelensky added. It is unrealistic for Ukraine to come close to Russia in terms of quantity of manpower, so the prevailing strategy is disrupting enemy logistics and striking the &#x201C;heart of the military-industrial complex&#x201D; in the rears, according to Dmytro Zhmaylo, co-founder and executive director of the Kyiv-based think tank Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center. While Ukraine continues to hold a patch of Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast captured during a surprise incursion two months ago, Russian troops continue their grinding advance in the eastern Donetsk Oblast, capturing the mining town of Vuhledar this past week. Ukraine needs to rely on &quot;non-standard&quot; tactics, including long-range strikes, to gain the upper hand against Russia on the battlefield, Zhmaylo said. Ukraine used such tactics using Western weaponry for long-range artillery and rocket strikes to push out Russian troops from parts of Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts by destroying warehouses and logistic routes for months during the autumn 2022 counteroffensive. Now, Ukraine is deploying its homemade long-range, domestically-developed drones to strike targets as far as over 1,000 kilometers deep inside Russia. The effects have already been felt in Russia. A Ukrainian air intelligence soldier carries a drone near the embattled town of Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Oblast, on May 10, 2024. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)In September, Ukraine&#x2019;s military said it had struck the Tikhoretsk arms depot in Russia&#x2019;s southwestern Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of the three largest Russian ammunition storage sites key to the Russian military&apos;s logistics. The U.K. Defense Ministry confirmed the Ukrainian Sept. 20-21 overnight drone strike on the Tikhoretsk ammunition depot and another site in Tver Oblast deeper into Russia, as well as another Sept. 18 attack in Tver Oblast that &quot;almost certainly destroyed at least 30,000 tons of ammunition in open and bunker storage.&quot; &#x201C;The strikes will almost certainly cause, at a minimum, short-term disruption to Russian artillery and small arms munitions supplies, critical resources in a war of attrition dominated by mass fires,&#x201D; the U.K. Defense Ministry said. In an attempt to showcase Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to strike Russian territory, Zelensky has stressed that precise long-range Western weapons could inflict much more damage &#x2014; and that drones &#x201C;still do not have enough range.&#x201D; Zhmaylo said that if there is enough Western support and long-range strikes are permitted, &#x201C;only a few months&#x201D; is needed for the damage to be felt on the battlefield. &#x201C;If it&#x2019;s only drones, then we may not feel it on the battlefield because, during this time, Russia will simply sign more contracts, more echelons (carrying resources) will arrive, and the damage may not be so noticeable,&#x201D; Zhmaylo said. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent say that Russia&#x2019;s current pace of losses &#x2014; often disproportionate to the limited gains attained &#x2014; doesn&#x2019;t appear sustainable, even if Moscow continues to hold the initiative across most of the front line in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region. &#x201C;I expect Russia will experience serious shortages toward the end of 2025 and especially in 2026, assuming the war continues that long,&#x201D; said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). But Hardie expects Russia to maintain the current offensive pace &#x201C;at least through this autumn.&#x201D; According to a February report by the London-based defense think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Russia had about 4,780 barrel artillery pieces, 1,130 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, 2,060 tanks, 7,080 other armored fighting vehicles, 290 helicopters, and 310 fighter jets.

(Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Having lost thousands of tanks and armored vehicles, the analysts are skeptical about whether the Russian arms manufacturing machine can keep up with the pace as the Soviet stocks slowly drain out. Highlighting Russia&apos;s domestic weaponry limitations, the country has stepped up supplies of ballistic missiles from North Korea and Iran. Russia has been heavily dependent on Iranian kamikaze drones of the Shahid type for air strikes during its invasion and, more recently, on North Korean artillery ammunition. Moscow has switched to small assault groups rather than battalions that rely more on human resources rather than equipment, according to military experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. This appears to be a sign of gradual resource depletion. Hardie said coordinating attacks above the company level, which typically consists of roughly 100 men in Ukraine, remains a challenge for both sides. &#x201C;If this war were to continue for several years, we will eventually come to a point where Russia won&apos;t be just able to keep taking stuff from the storages,&#x201D; said Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based organization that monitors the war in Ukraine with satellite imagery and social media. The Russian arsenal is generally divided into two categories: equipment &quot;resurrected from the long-term storage,&quot; such as &quot;very old tanks and artillery pieces&#x201D; from World War II, and brand new or recently upgraded equipment that is more modern, according to Paroinen. Russia is losing three times more equipment than Ukraine on average, &#x201C;steadily draining its stockpiles of inherited Soviet equipment with its production, just like in the case of Ukraine, covering only a small fraction of what they are losing,&#x201D; said Prague-based analyst Jakub Janovsky, who works at the Dutch open-source intelligence monitoring site Oryx. Over two and a half years of full-scale war, Russia has lost at least 3,432 tanks, 1,624 other armored fighting vehicles, and 4,679 infantry fighting vehicles as of early October, Oryx reported, citing what it visually confirmed independently. Infographics showing the number of howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems allocated to Ukraine as of June 2024. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Janovsky said Ukraine has been claiming a much higher destruction rate of Russian artillery since last year, and &#x201C;if a substantial percentage of those claims is true, Ukraine is likely to overtake or significantly reduce the Russian advance in this regard.&#x201D; But he stressed that the artillery loss is difficult to visually confirm independently, and it is unclear whether Ukraine is counting light mortars as part of its triumph. &#x201C;If the war continues at approximately current intensity and rate of losses, it&apos;s entirely possible that at some point next year, Russia might either lose or have significantly degraded ability to conduct mechanized offensives because so many tanks, infantry fighting vehicle, etc. will be lost,&#x201D; Janovsky said. According to Janovsky, as the quality of Russia&#x2019;s Soviet-era stocks decreases, the closer they reach the bottom of its arsenal, they become easier targets for Ukrainian artillery or drone fire. The outdated equipment lacks features such as thermal sight and is more vulnerable to mechanical failures. As Russia slowly drains its massive Soviet-era stocks, Ukraine has been receiving from Western allies more advanced weapons and equipment &#x2014; though limited in numbers and often with long delivery times. Just before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Western allies flooded Ukraine&#x2019;s army with hand-held anti-tank busters, including the U.S. Javelins and Stinger air defense systems, to target Russian helicopters and low-flying jets. Infographics showing the number of infantry fighting vehicles and tanks allocated to Ukraine as of June 2024. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)After Ukraine&#x2019;s forces successfully used the kit to repel Russia&#x2019;s attempt to seize Kyiv, allies gradually stepped up the firepower provided to Ukraine: first with NATO-grade artillery, later with multiple launch rocket systems such as the U.S.-made HIMARS. Later, from 2023 into 2024, they supplied tanks, long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles, ATACMS missiles, and, most recently, batches of F-16 fighter jets that started arriving this summer. Janovsky stressed that &#x201C;the current level of support is for Ukraine to defend territory, but not much more.&#x201D; As Ukrainian troops struggle to hold the frontlines in the far eastern Donbas region, &#x201C;the biggest unknown&#x201D; affecting the war&apos;s outcome is the future depth of Western military aid, Janovsky said. Questions loom about whether Kyiv&#x2019;s backers will give Ukraine enough to win the war, possibly by forcing Russia into fair peace talks that Zelensky says his &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; aims to achieve or continue a drip-feed approach that keeps its forces in the fight but unable to liberate some 20% of territory still occupied by Russia. Much depends on the results of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, experts added. Both presidential candidates remain vague on their Ukraine policy, with Republican candidate Donald Trump skeptical about further U.S. support for Kyiv and Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket not addressing it in detail. Some analysts &#x2014; and Ukrainian soldiers alike &#x2014; are more worried about Ukraine running out of resources faster than Russia, which had years to prepare a powerful war machine. Western nations have provided Ukraine with over 820 tanks, over 1,180 infantry fighting vehicles, over 630 howitzers, and over 80 multiple-launch rocket systems as of June 2024, according to the think tank IfW Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks Ukraine aid. The Ukrainian military needs much more weapons, as they are quickly depleted by Russian fire.

(Photo by Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)In a rare example of publicly admitting shortcomings in September, Zelensky said Ukraine didn&apos;t receive enough Western military aid to equip &quot;even four out of 14&quot; new Ukrainian brigades needed.&#x200C; Speaking to the Financial Times after his exit, former NATO military alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged that he and all allies need to take responsibility for not giving enough weapons to Ukraine when it needed them the most. &#x201C;If there&#x2019;s anything I in a way regret and see much more clearly now is that we should have provided Ukraine with much more military support much earlier,&#x201D; he told the Financial Times. &#x201C;I think we all have to admit, we should have given them more weapons pre-invasion. And we should have given them more advanced weapons, faster, after the invasion. I take my part of the responsibility.&#x201D; During Zelensky&apos;s September trip to the U.S., Biden announced a new $8 billion worth of military aid package for Ukraine, including a Patriot air defense battery, unmanned aerial systems, and long-range Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) munition. However, experts say that the decisions are made too slowly, and so are the deliveries, with Washington&#x2019;s nearly six-month delay in the $61 billion worth of military aid finally approved in April still taking a toll on the Donbas front line.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)For now, time is on the Russian side when comparing mobilization potential, manpower, and production capacity, warned Konrad Muzyka, Poland-based analyst and director of Rochan Consulting. &#x201C;It&apos;s just impossible to predict how the war will develop because just too many factors influence the battlefield of the current stage,&#x201D; Muzyka said, elaborating that the situation is similar for both sides. &#x201C;Not only the ones that are quantifiable, but those are unfortunately the ones that are not quantifiable, for instance, the quality of command and control.&#x201D; Experts said that as important as the slingshots in the rears may be, the basic resources &#x2013; from ammunition to armored vehicles and artillery &#x2013; are crucial to holding the front line. They stressed that long-range strikes alone would not be a game changer if the Ukrainian military lacked the essentials on the battlefield. &#x201C;You need the basic stuff to actually move the frontline,&#x201D; Muzyka said. &#x201C;Right now ... the largest amount of problems come from the lack of men, lack of basic materials, vehicles, ammunition, even a lack of medical equipment and so on.&#x201D; &#x201C;All of this sort of basic stuff, which, when we are fighting attritional warfare, this is the stuff that gets depleted,&#x201D; he summed up. &#x201C;This is the resource we are fighting the war of attrition in.&#x201D; However, analyst Janovsky, speaking ahead of the Ramstein meeting, said that no matter how much more manpower and firepower Moscow may have on the battlefield, &#x201C;Russian advantages are not decisive.&#x201D; &#x201C;If the West tomorrow decides to increase the current level of help, let&#x2019;s say doubling it, it would be a huge problem for Russia.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-scrambles-for-resources-before-uncertain-us-elections/	2024-10-05T08:47:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2149869538.jpg
Defense in Zakarpattia teenage sexual assault case seeks dismissal	Editor&apos;s Note: The names of the teenagers in the case are not mentioned, as Ukrainian law does not allow them to be made public.After over a year of court hearings, attorneys defending three Ukrainian teenagers convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Zakarpattia Oblast have asked the court to close the case against them. The three teenage boys committed the crime back in 2021, filmed it on camera, and posted the video online, for which the court in western Ukraine gave them only two years of probation and a fine last March. The court&apos;s decision caused a nationwide scandal, prompting several lawyers to take the girl&apos;s case pro bono and fight for a stricter verdict. As the trial neared its final stage, the defense filed a motion to close the criminal proceedings on Oct. 4, the same day the court debates were scheduled &quot;essentially disrupting the conclusion of the process,&quot; said Illia Vorobyov, an attorney from Miller legal company and one of those representing the victim. According to Vorobiov, the defense is &quot;trying to take advantage&quot; of the fact the girl did not attend all court sessions, claiming it is trying to present this as her &quot;refusal to support the prosecution.&quot; &quot;I am confident that this is a deliberate attempt by the defense to delay the proceedings. But it will not help the accused avoid punishment,&quot; Vorobiov told the Kyiv Independent. Vorobiov says the issue of the girl not being present at every court session was addressed at the beginning of the new trial in 2023, when both her representatives and the prosecutors asked the court to allow her not to attend all the court hearings, limiting her participation to just her testimony. &quot;This is necessary to prevent the re-traumatization of the child, as during the trial, we question witnesses, those accused, and examine all evidence in great detail,&quot; Vorobiov says. &quot;These processes are emotionally challenging even for me, despite my extensive experience in criminal justice,&quot; he adds. &#xA0; &quot;It seems that everyone understands this except the defense. They believe this girl should relive all these events in detail again. This is why we consider today&apos;s motion by the defense to be an outright act of cynicism.&quot; According to the court&apos;s statement, the girl was hit in the stomach and bent over with her head squeezed between one of the boys&apos; legs. Then they took off her clothes and underwear and &quot;committed acts of a sexual nature, not related to penetrating the body,&quot; causing her physical pain, the document reads. The official reason for the soft sentence back in 2023 was that the crime was rendered as sexual violence, not rape. According to the Ukrainian Criminal Code, rape committed by a group of people or rape of a minor is punishable by 7-12 years of imprisonment, while sexual violence against a minor or committed by a group is 5-7 years behind bars. The only difference between them is that rape implies the act of penetration into the victim&apos;s body, which the court claimed did not take place. &quot;The idea that rape is horrendous and sexual violence is not is wrong,&quot; attorney Anna Kalynchuk told the Kyiv Independent in April 2023. &quot;Pain, humiliation, and severe stress are the same for rape and sexual violence,&quot; she said. Vorobiov says they hope the court debates will occur by the end of October, &quot;after which it will be up to the judge to make a decision.&quot; &quot;We are against a suspended sentence for the accused. Throughout the trial, I have not sensed any genuine remorse or admission of guilt for what they did. Therefore, we will be requesting imprisonment for the accused,&quot; he added. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-in-zakarpattia-teenage-sexual-assault-case-seeks-dismissal/	2024-10-05T08:09:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-19-22.17.26-1.jpeg
Ukraine hit 3 Russian command posts with Storm Shadows and GMLRS, military claims	Ukrainian forces have hit three Russian command posts using Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and GMLRS rockets, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 5. The attacks struck the command posts of the 35th and 27th separate motor rifle brigades, as well as that of the 2nd Combined Arms Army of the Russian Armed Forces, the General Staff said in a post on Telegram. It did not specify the locations of the strikes or the dates on which they were carried out, only saying they happened &quot;the other day.&quot; &quot;The results of the strikes are being clarified,&quot; the report said, adding: &quot;The attack was carried out by Storm Shadow missiles and GMLRS rockets. &quot;The destruction of the occupiers continues. Next will be...&quot; U.S.-supplied GMLRS rockets have a range of around 70 kilometers and are fired from HIMARS launchers. They were a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022, allowing Ukraine to target Russian forces in occupied territories far more accurately than they had previously. Ukraine has previously used the British&#x2013;supplied Storm Shadow missiles, with a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The Telegraph reported in August, citing unnamed sources, that the U.K. was privately in favor of allowing Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles in strikes on Russia itself, but was unwilling to publicly press for such a change in policy due to fears of backlash from the U.S. Kyiv has long argued that restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range weapons are stifling its war effort, while Washington has claimed that allowing Ukraine to hit deep into Russian territory with its weapons could escalate the situation. Hopes had been high last month that Ukraine would finally be granted permission to strike deep inside Russian territory with the weapons, but the issue was once again put on hold. In the meantime, Ukraine has been striking targets deep inside Russia with its own domestically-produced weapons, most recently taking out several Russian ammunition storage sites. In September, Ukraine targeted depots in the Russian towns of Tikhoretsk and Toropets with drones, setting ablaze over 30,000 tons of ammunition, which allegedly included ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-ukraine-hits-3-russian-command-points-with-western-weapons/	2024-10-05T07:44:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/scalp-10.004.jpg
That's not what Georgian people want' – President Zourabichvili blasts ruling party's pro-Russia stance	Georgia and Ukraine have long been close. Witnessing revolutions that brought democratic pro-Western governments, both countries later witnessed a Russian military attack, in the Kremlin&apos;s attempt to pull both states back into Moscow&apos;s orbit. It now looks like in Georgia, 16 years after a brief war that left 20% of the country occupied, Moscow had succeeded. The ruling Georgian Dream party has been methodically imposing oppressive laws, mimicking those that were previously adopted by Moscow. The adoption of controversial laws targeting civil society, independent media, and the LGBTQ+ community akin to Russian legislation rolled back years of westward progress and effectively halted EU accession for Tbilisi, once a poster child of liberal and democratic reforms in the region. The pivot from the West toward Russia has sparked mass protests across this largely pro-Western and pro-Ukrainian country and caused a pushback from some key figures in the country&apos;s public and political life. With the Georgian Dream party in power, relations between Kyiv and Tbilisi took a similar dive. The Georgian government remained on the sidelines of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the ruling party using images of war as a scare tactic ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections, scheduled for late October. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent figure, is a staunch advocate for Georgia&apos;s European and Euro-Atlantic strive and has sought to veto the controversial legislation without success. Though initially endorsed by Georgian Dream during her victorious 2018 presidential run, Zourabichvili and the ruling party later found themselves in opposing political camps. Now, according to her, the upcoming parliament election is a referendum on the country&apos;s future. The Kyiv Independent met with President Zourabichvili at the Warsaw Security Forum on Oct. 1 to discuss Georgian-Ukrainian relations, Russian growing influence in Georgia, and the country&apos;s future now on the ballot. The Kyiv Independent: Georgia&apos;s ruling party has recently passed foreign agents law and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that resembles similar legislation in Russia. Why did the Georgian Dream party push this legislation forward despite protests at home and opposition from Western partners? President Salome Zourabichvili: &#xA0;That&apos;s something you have to ask them, not me. I&apos;ve been opposing this law, as was the vast majority of the Georgian population: once last year on the streets and another time this year on the streets. I put my veto on this law. It has now gone also to the Constitutional Court, (but) to no effect because the Constitutional Court is delaying its assessment of the constitutionality of this law. But &quot;why&quot; is a question that has to be answered by those who made this decision. What we can say from the outside is that this looks very much like the modus operandi of the Russians when they were trying to coerce and restrain their civil society. That&apos;s how they first started to try to take control of non-governmental organizations, to put pressure on them. And that&apos;s what&apos;s happening today. It is even more of a concern in Georgia because it is happening on the eve of elections when these organizations have an important role to play in terms of monitoring the elections and being very much involved in this pre-electoral campaign. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;A decade ago, Georgia was seen as the country most prepared for EU accession, both in terms of rule of law and legislation, from the Eastern trio (Georgia, Armenia, and Ukraine). Now, it is lagging behind, and the process is effectively frozen. How was this development possible? President Salome Zourabichvili: This has come as a result of the positions taken by the authorities, which have really lagged behind in implementing the first 12 recommendations given by the European Union and then the nine recommendations. Despite that, the candidate status granted to Georgia was received &#x2013; and that&apos;s a very important sign &#x2013; with enthusiasm from the whole population without any distinction between who the people were supporting or not supporting. So, it really reflects the sense of the population as a whole. And after that started an intensification of anti-European rhetoric and anti-American rhetoric, and very aggressive accusations of our partners, Europeans, and Americans, of wanting to open a second front in Georgia. &quot;When one knows what the European Union is about, why it was created, and how difficult it is for European countries to think about war, even about supporting Ukraine, it&apos;s something you could laugh about if it was not so very concerning when you see that type of propaganda at work in a country like Georgia, propaganda that is completely in line with what the Russians are portraying on their side.&quot; Salome Zourabichvili, President of Georgia during Warsaw Security Forum 2024, in Warsaw, Poland on Oct. 1, 2024. (Foto Olimpik/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;Would you say that Moscow is now calling the shots in Tbilisi? President Salome Zourabichvili: It&apos;s very difficult to say whether they&apos;re (Russia) calling the shots or whether the ruling party is trying to please the Russians out of its own initiative, but it doesn&apos;t really matter. That&apos;s something that you cannot know from the outside. What is important is this parallelism, this similarity that says a lot about the direction in which the ruling party is going, and which I&apos;m convinced will be overrun in the coming elections because that&apos;s not what the Georgian people, having two territories occupied, can want for its own future. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;Do you think the upcoming parliamentary elections will decide Georgia&apos;s future? President Salome Zourabichvili: Of course. First of all, it&apos;s going to be a quasi-referendum, because that&apos;s the way it&apos;s seen by the population, that we are choosing now whether we go back to our European past, or whether we accept and defer to the Russian indirect pressure. And that&apos;s the way the Georgian population is preparing for these elections. That&apos;s the way in which the political forces are preparing themselves, and there is by now common ground and platform for the four pro-European opposition parties. And I think that we are going in good condition towards these elections. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;What do you think about a statement by Mr. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of Georgian Dream, that Georgia carries the blame for the war of 2008 and that it should apologize? President Salome Zourabichvili: It&apos;s not one declaration, it&apos;s a set of all the recent declarations and rhetoric that goes in one direction. It is (designed) to please Russia and to attack our friends and partners. So that is the image in general that is very preoccupying in Georgia. And that is what the Georgian population sees, and doesn&apos;t understand, and I&apos;m sure doesn&apos;t share. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;There have been signs of deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Georgia, Georgian Dream has even used footage of war in its campaign ads. How would you describe the current state of relations between Ukraine and Georgia? President Salome Zourabichvili: I would not describe that as relations between Ukraine and Georgia. I would describe that as relations between Ukraine and the ruling party of Georgia. That does not describe the state of mind of the Georgian population, which was upset in a very brutal way by this campaign launched by the ruling party, which put in contrast the war in Ukraine and the supposed peace in Georgia. Nobody liked it, and they had to withdraw some of these videos. And I think that the state of relations between Georgia and Ukraine is better described and seen on the streets of Tbilisi, where you see Ukrainian flags almost everywhere, and the way in which Ukrainians are received by the Georgian population. So I&apos;m quite optimistic about the future of our relations after.	https://kyivindependent.com/thats-not-what-georgian-people-want-president-zourabichvili-blasts-ruling-partys-pro-russia-stance/	2024-10-05T05:47:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175488096-1.jpg
Zelensky to present 'victory plan' at upcoming Ramstein meeting	President Volodymyr Zelensky will present his victory plan during the upcoming leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12. &quot;We will present the victory plan &#x2014; clear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming Ramstein meeting will be the first one held on a leader-level. During the last 24th meeting Zeensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. Zelensky already presented his five-point plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House during his trip to U.S. in late September. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. On Oct. 2, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. had reviewed Ukraine&apos;s victory plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps&quot; there. &quot;The victory plan that Ukraine presented is not just a question of actions that Ukraine would take. It&#x2019;s a question of actions that other countries around the world would take as well,&quot; Miller said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-present-victory-plan-at-upcoming-ramstein-meeting/	2024-10-05T04:12:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2156549690.jpg
Russia increasingly launching 'unspecified' types of drones against Ukraine, Air Force says	Russian forces are increasingly launching &quot;unspecified&quot; models of drones against Ukraine alongside those of the Shahed type, former Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in a comment to Ukrainska Pravda on Oct. 5. Russia has stepped up drone attacks in recent weeks &#x2014; for the first time since the full-scale invasion, they targeted cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis for an entire month in September. This daily trend has continued for the first days of October and commenting on the latest overnight attack, Ihnat said that 10 drones were likely of different, unspecified types and could only be properly identified after being examined on the ground. Ihnat did not elaborate on what type of drones they could be. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. While initially sourcing them from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production. In July, Russia began using a new type of cheaply-made drone to identify air defense systems and act as decoys, Andrii Cherniak, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. Made of plywood and plastic foam, he said this type of drone was used to reveal the location of air defense systems and film damage, with one type able to carry a camera and Ukrainian sim card to send footage back to Russia. &quot;They identify where our mobile groups are positioned, where the machine guns are that can destroy them,&quot; Cherniak told Reuters. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser to the presidential office&apos;s head, also said that Russian troops used a new type of drone &#x2014; Gerbera &#x2014; in limited numbers in an attack in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-began-increasingly-launching-unspecified-types-of-drones-against-ukraine-air-force-says/	2024-10-05T03:14:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1489472156.jpg
Ukraine's 'dragon drones' are now reportedly destroying Russian tanks	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry on Oct. 4 released a video of what it said was a &quot;dragon drone&quot; destroying a Russian tank. Described as &quot;truly unique combat footage,&quot; the video shows a Russian vehicle first being stopped in its tracks by what appears to be artillery fire. The clip then shows a drone flying above the tank &quot;spewing molten thermite,&quot; before it cuts to a scene showing the vehicle engulfed in flames. Truly unique combat footage: a &quot;dragon&quot; drone spews molten thermite on russian tank and destroys it.&#x1F4F9;: 30th Mechanized Brigade pic.twitter.com/gPPQ8mMmXz The Kyiv Independent could not verify the video. Thermite weapons disperse thousands of tiny pieces of molten metal burning at temperatures that exceed 2,000 degrees Celsius, which means that it can melt through some armored vehicles. The first videos of the new type of drone emerged on Sept. 2, when videos began circulating on social media of one spraying what appeared to be fiery, white-hot metal on a treeline in an undisclosed part of the battlefield. No troops are visible in the video. On Sept. 4, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed its forces were behind what were dubbed &quot;dragon drones,&quot; and since then, more videos have surfaced. Thermite and other incendiary weapons can cause devastating injuries. Human Rights Watch writes that being exposed to such munitions can lead to &quot;extensive and excruciating burns that require painful treatment&quot; that include &quot;respiratory damage from inflamed airways and toxic fumes, infection, extreme dehydration, and organ failure.&quot; Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dragon-drones-are-now-reportedly-destroying-russian-tanks/	2024-10-05T01:55:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-05-at-11_47_09.png
Stoltenberg suggests Ukraine could be granted NATO membership even with territories occupied by Russia	Ukraine could potentially join NATO even if parts of its territory remained occupied by Russia, the alliance&apos;s former Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview on Oct. 4. One of the main arguments against granting Ukraine membership at the current time is that NATO&apos;s Article 5 mutual defense clause would immediately draw the alliance into a direct war with Russia. But speaking to the Financial Times, Stoltenberg suggested there could be ways to get around this if the Ukrainian territory considered part of NATO was &quot;not necessarily the internationally recognized border.&quot; &quot;When there is a will, there are ways to find the solution. But you need a line which defines where Article 5 is invoked, and Ukraine has to control all the territory until that border,&quot; he said. As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially occupied by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Stoltenberg drew on historical and current examples to illustrate that certain compromises or security guarantees could be made to ensure Ukraine&apos;s protection. &quot;West Germany regarded East Germany as part of the bigger Germany. They didn&#x2019;t have an embassy in East Berlin. But NATO was, of course, only protecting West Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;Again, it is always very dangerous to compare because no parallels are 100 percent correct, but the U.S. has security guarantees to Japan. But they don&#x2019;t cover the Kuril (Islands), which Japan regards as Japanese territory, controlled by Russia.&quot; Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 but has yet to receive a formal invitation. Despite high expectations in Kyiv, the last two allied summits brought only new steps toward deepening Ukraine-NATO cooperation and a declaration that the country&apos;s membership path is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Earlier on Oct. 1, however, FT reported, citing an unnamed Western official, that U.S. President Joe Biden may agree to advance the status of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership bid before leaving office in January. Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. In his recent interview with FT, Stoltenberg also said that Ukraine&#x2019;s allies should have supplied the country with more arms before the full-scale invasion started to prevent it. &quot;If there&#x2019;s anything I, in a way, regret and see much more clearly now is that we should have provided Ukraine with much more military support much earlier,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we all have to admit, we should have given them more weapons pre-invasion. And we should have given them more advanced weapons, faster, after the invasion. &quot;I take my part of the responsibility.&quot; Stoltenberg stepped down as NATO general secretary earlier this week with Mark Rutte now taking up the role.	https://kyivindependent.com/stoltenberg-says-ukraine-can-be-granted-nato-membership-even-with-occupied-territories/	2024-10-05T01:13:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763173.jpg
Half of Russia's shells used in Ukraine supplied by North Korea, The Times reports	Half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea, The Times reported on Oct. 4, citing Western intelligence sources. According to the newspaper, around 3 million a year are being shipped from Pyongyang to Moscow, though a large number are believed to be faulty. Despite this, The Times reports the sheer number of shells supplied have played a crucial role in Russia&apos;s grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, most recently the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast earlier this week. With Russian ammunition stocks running low due to extensive use in Ukraine, North Korea has been shaping up as Russia&apos;s leading outside weapons supplier. In August, Yonhap reported that North Korea sent containers presumably to Russia that could contain as many as more than 6 million artillery shells. In exchange for the ammunition, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. In late June, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang, where he signed a partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which pledged to provide aid to one another if either will be attacked. Shin Won-sik, South Korean defense minister, said in June that Pyongyang also sent dozens of ballistic missiles that Moscow&apos;s troops launch against Ukraine. But their reliability has also been questioned &#xA0;&#x2014; around half of the North Korean missiles fired at Ukraine by Russia have malfunctioned and exploded in mid-air, Reuters reported on May 7, citing Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/half-of-russias-shells-used-in-ukraine-supplied-by-north-korea-the-times-reports/	2024-10-04T23:59:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2157690883.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 659,220 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 659,220 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 5. This number includes 1,280 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,916 tanks, 17,658 armored fighting vehicles, 25,905 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,037 artillery systems, 1,216 multiple launch rocket systems, 970 air defense systems, 368 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,529 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-659-220-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-04T23:07:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2156168509-1.jpg
Ukraine has neutralized over 533,000 explosive devices since February, 2022	Pyrotechnic teams from Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service have detected and disposed of over 533,200 pieces of explosive ordnance since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022. The teams have cleared around 148,858 hectares of territory, including 4,018 aerial bombs, according to a report published on Oct. 4. Over the past 24 hours alone, the units of the State Emergency Service responded to 173 calls, removing and disposing of 293 explosives, including two air bombs, while surveying an additional 127,630 hectares. The regions most frequently requiring pyrotechnic deployment include Kharkiv (35,815 times), Kherson (16,560 times), Donetsk (14,826 times), Kyiv (11,393 times), Mykolaiv (9,360 times), Chernihiv (6,948 times), and Sumy (4,425 times). Authorities urge the public to report any suspicious objects by calling 101. Ukraine also remains the world&#x2019;s most mined country. The country&apos;s Defense Ministry specialists have cleared 30,000 square kilometers of mines over the past two years - an area comparable to the size of Belgium or Moldova. Since 2022, approximately 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian land have been contaminated with explosives, making 144,000 square kilometers still potentially dangerous.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-neutralized-over-533-000-explosive-devices-since-february-2022/	2024-10-04T20:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1745435165.jpg
Poland ready to start training volunteers for Ukrainian Legion	Deputy Defense Minister Pawel Zalewski announced on Oct. 4 that the Ukrainian consulate in Lublin has begun the recruitment of Ukrainian volunteers residing in Poland, who will receive training from Polish forces. Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz noted that Poland was prepared to begin the training in September, but a shortage of volunteers delayed the start. &quot;At that time, not enough volunteers came forward. I understand that now Ukraine has taken action related to information, recruitment and promotion of this process, so we are counting on the results,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz told the local news outlet Wnp.pl. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The legion was announced as part of the security agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on July 8. Zalewski also said that Poland, through the EU training program, has already trained over 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and overall resilience are vital for Poland&apos;s security and the country continues to explore options for supplying Ukraine with resources. &quot;We continue to work on what is possible to transfer to Ukraine, but also to participate in international projects, for example related to the purchase of ammunition for Ukraine,&quot; Zalewski added.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ready-to-start-training-volunteers-for-ukrainian-legion/	2024-10-04T18:28:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2079424446.jpg
Thousands of Jewish pilgrims travel to Ukraine for Rosh Hashana, despite official warnings	Despite warnings from Ukrainian and Israeli officials about security risks, around 35,000 Jewish pilgrims traveled to Uman in Cherkasy Oblast to celebrate Rosh Hashana this year, according to local authorities. The pilgrims gathered to pray at the tomb of Rabbi Nachman, a significant figure in the Hasidic movement, even as the country remains embroiled in war with Russia. Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman, a prominent leader in Ukraine&#x2019;s Jewish community, had previously advised pilgrims to avoid visiting due to safety concerns, though many proceeded with their annual pilgrimage. &quot;Every year (since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion), I speak on Israeli television and radio, and I call on the (Jewish) pilgrims not to come to Ukraine. My primary concern is for the lives of people,&quot; he said, according to Associated Press. More than 14,000 Jewish pilgrims were unable to travel to Uman, Ukraine, for the annual Rosh Hashana pilgrimage this year due to complications arising from Iran&#x2019;s missile attack on Israel earlier in the week. The attack, which saw nearly 180 missiles fired, led to the cancellation of several flights from Israel. This year&#x2019;s pilgrimage also coincided with heightened tensions in the Middle East, including Israel&#x2019;s conflicts with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various Iran-backed militant groups. With Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace closed since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, pilgrims had to travel overland through other European countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-of-jewish-pilgrims-travel-to-ukraine-for-rosh-hashana-despite-official-warnings/	2024-10-04T15:59:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1672473081.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lithuania urges ICC to investigate Lukashenko for crimes against humanity	Lithuania urges the International Criminal Court to investigate dictator Alexander Lukashenko and his regime for crimes against humanity, citing mass repression, deportations, and persecution of Belarusians. Vladimir Putin of Russia announces amendments to nuclear doctrine, threatening nuclear response for aggression against Belarus. IAEA director general confirms safety of controversial Belarusian Astraviets Nuclear Power Plant. Baltic states and Poland seek EU funding for a joint defense line along borders with Belarus, Russia. Belarus designates the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment as a terrorist organization. Lithuania has formally requested that the International Criminal Court or ICC investigate alleged crimes against humanity by the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, including deportations and persecution of Belarusian citizens. The Lithuanian Ministry of Justice announced on Sept. 30 that it had referred to offenses against the civilian population in Belarus primarily carried out since May 2020, when the Lukashenko regime started to increasingly target civilians through deportation and to persecute its political opponents. Lithuanian government accuses top Belarusian military officers, law enforcers, judiciary officials, and Lukashenko personally of waging a &#x201C;widespread and systematic attack&#x201D; on Belarusians, which includes &#x201C;serious deprivation of fundamental rights; arbitrary detention, prosecution, and conviction; serious unlawful violence; unlawful killings; and sexual violence.&#x201D; By carrying out mass repression, Lithuania said, the Lukashenko regime has forced hundreds of thousands of Belarusians to flee the country and settle in neighboring states, including Lithuania, which may constitute the crime of mass deportation. The leader of Belarusian exiled opposition, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, hailed the move. &#x201C;It brings hope to hundreds of thousands of victims of the regime,&#x201D; she wrote on X. The ICC prosecutor general confirmed the receipt of the referral in a statement, claiming that a preliminary examination of the request is due, and the results will determine whether the investigation will be opened. If commenced, the investigation could become grounds for the ICC to issue an arrest warrant for the Belarusian dictator. Despite Belarus not being a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction due to the crimes being committed on the territories of participating nations. The case relies on the Myanmar/Bangladesh precedent, in which a state party to the Rome Statute of the ICC (Bangladesh) filed a case on crimes allegedly committed by Myanmar, which is not a Rome Statute signatory, maintaining that the crimes affected the said state party. Lithuania, which previously succeeded in bringing charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin, said it is now seeking an arrest warrant for Lukashenko. &#x201C;Lithuania has taken the first step on behalf of (the regime&#x2019;s) victims, but we urge and ask others to join us in doing what is essential and necessary for justice to prevail,&#x201D; Lithuanian Justice Minister Ewelina Dobrowolska said. According to a UN special rapporteur&#x2019;s report, around 300,000 Belarusian citizens have fled the country in fear of persecution. Lithuania currently hosts around 60,000 Belarusians on its territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced amendments to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear doctrine on Sept. 25, claiming that Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if its closest ally, Belarus, is attacked. During a meeting of the Russian Security Council on nuclear deterrence, Putin announced an array of modifications to Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine that further blurred the terms for using Russia&#x2019;s nuclear arsenal. One proposal, clearly aimed at the United States&#x2019; support for Ukraine, includes considering an act of aggression against Russia by a non-nuclear state, if it is backed by a nuclear state, as a &#x201C;joint attack&#x201D; on Russia. Putin also stated that Russia might use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack with conventional weapons that posed a critical threat to Russia and Belarus. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko thanked Putin for the amendments and claimed that an &#x201C;attack on Belarus (would mean) World War III.&#x201D; Lukashenko also claimed that NATO countries had deployed troops on the border with Belarus, specifically in Poland. He gave no evidence to back his claim. Putin&#x2019;s announcement comes as the United States mulls permitting Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. Experts believe Putin&#x2019;s move is a clear warning to Western states in Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;high-stake PR game.&#x201D; &#x201C;If you help Ukraine militarily, we may also target you.&#x201D; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Sept. 26 that updates had been made to a document titled &#x201C;The Foundations of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence.&#x201D; Minsk, which has no nuclear weapons of its own, has also taken part in the Kremlin&#x2019;s nuclear blackmail by signing on May 25, 2023 an agreement on the deployment of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus. The weapons were reportedly delivered shortly after, and Belarus took part in Russian nuclear drills in 2024. However, no evidence of the actual transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus has ever been provided. Lukashenko has been Putin&#x2019;s steadfast ally, allowing Russian troops into Belarus to launch an attack on Kyiv from the north, and providing the Russian army with infrastructure and equipment. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi arrived in Belarus on Oct. 1 for high-level meetings and a visit to the country&#x2019;s controversial Astraviets nuclear power plant. Grossi and the team of experts were to assess the situation at the nuclear plant, which has been in operation for the past four years, and examine Belarus&#x2019; progress in &#x201C;addressing the findings of an IAEA operational safety review in 2021,&#x201D; according to an IAEA press release. Following his visit to the nuclear power plant, Grossi stated that the operations at the Astraviets power plant were in line with international nuclear safety standards. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s confidence in this country,&#x201D; Grossi said in an excerpt from an interview published by the Belarusian Energy Ministry. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s confidence in neighboring countries, which is also important, that this unit does not bring any problems; on the contrary, it&#x2019;s providing clean energy for this country.&#x201D; The Belarusian nuclear power plant in Astraviets is an ambitious project funded by a Russian credit line to Belarus and carried out by a Russian contractor. Built in the western Belarusian city of Astraviets, around 56 kilometers away from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, the power plant has long been a problem for the Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian intelligence has claimed that Belarus concealed defects in the nuclear plant&#x2019;s reactors, and said that cracks in the nuclear plant&#x2019;s first reactor were spotted but not repaired. Lithuania&#x2019;s State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate (VATESI) called on Belarus in May 2023 to halt the operation of its nuclear power plant until all nuclear safety issues had been resolved. During a meeting with Grossi, Lukashenko assured his guest that the nuclear power plant was safe. He labeled the concerns of neighboring Lithuania as &#x201C;speculation.&#x201D; Critics claim the Astraviets plant was built with a host of flaws. The independent Belarusian investigative journalist team BIC said they had received internal documents specifying 18,000 flaws that needed correction. While none of them could generate a nuclear disaster, they rendered the plant idle for repair for 40% of its first year of operations. Lithuania, formerly a major importer of Belarusian electricity, refused to continue purchasing energy due to concerns over the safety of the nuclear plant. In July, the Baltic states notified Belarus and Russia that they were disconnecting their electricity supply systems from the old Soviet energy grid and switching to the European power grid. Ukraine, the second largest importer of Belarusian-generated electricity, made sporadic imports and then completely stopped buying Belarusian electricity in 2022. NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland will seek European funding for a joint project to build defenses along their border with Russia and Belarus, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of announced on Sept. 28. The Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Estonian defense ministers met in Daugavpils, Latvia, to discuss funding and examine Ukraine&#x2019;s experience in building its defensive structures. The ministers have also visited Latvia&#x2019;s border in the Silene region. &#x201C;The need for a defense line stems from the security situation and supports NATO&#x2019;s new forward defense concept,&#x201D; Estonia&#x2019;s public broadcaster ERR recorded Pevkur as saying. The easternmost NATO members agreed to build a Baltic defense line on Jan. 19 this year, prompted by Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression against Ukraine and Putin&#x2019;s repeated threats against NATO states. In May, Poland announced the construction of a similar project, Eastern Shield, to reinforce its borders with the Russian exclave Kaliningrad and with Belarus. The defense line, consisting of obstacles and field fortification measures, is designed to deter or slow down an attack at the countries&#x2019; borders. No minefields or barbed wire is planned for the line in peacetime. The exact amount of requested aid remains unspecified. Earlier, some EU officials estimated the cost of building this defense line along the EU&#x2019;s 700-kilometer border with Russia and Belarus would be around $2.67 billion.

(Oleksii Samsonov /Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Belarus&#x2019; Supreme Court ruled on Sept. 25 that the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, a Belarusian formation within the Ukrainian army, be declared a terrorist organization, according to the press office of the Belarusian Prosecutor General. According to the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s statement, the Kastus Kalinouski regiment and its members engaged in &#x201C;recruiting, arming, training and employing terrorists&#x201D; as well as &#x201C;financing terrorist activities,&#x201D; which ultimately resulted in alleged terrorist acts in Belarus. The regiment, in an official statement, said it considers the designation &#x201C;another step by the dictator toward the possible expansion of the war, and an additional declaration of loyalty to Moscow.&#x201D; The formation, consisting of Belarusian nationals, was incorporated in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in March 2022, in the early days of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As of January 2024, around 350 Belarusians were serving in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment and other units of Belarusian volunteers defending Ukraine from Russian aggression, according to Andrei Kushnerau, the founder of the Association of Belarusian Volunteers. In Belarus, the volunteers face prison terms on charges of creating an extremist formation, and their relatives are harassed by the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s law enforcement. At least 13 Belarusians have been jailed for intending to join the regiment and defend Ukraine, and ten have received prison terms for donating funds to Belarusian fighters, which is considered to be &#x201C;war financing&#x201D; by Belarusian prosecutors. Of the approximately 1,300 Belarusians who have fought for Ukraine since 2014, sixty have been killed in action, and two taken prisoner by the Russian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lithuania-urges-icc-to-investigate-lukashenko-for-crimes-against-humanity/	2024-10-04T14:05:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242954831.jpg
Russian drone debris found in Danube Delta, Romanian Defense Ministry confirms	Romanian border police on Oct. 4 discovered debris from a Russian drone in the Litcov canal area, located in Romania&apos;s Danube Delta region. Authorities alerted the Ministry of National Defense, which, along with the Romanian Intelligence Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, conducted a search of the site. Fragments of the drone were collected for analysis, following legal procedures. The investigated area is located in a rural zone, and no infrastructure was damaged, according to police. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones have been found on Romanian territory, which is a NATO country. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. On Sept. 9, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said that it had found Russian drone fragments near the village of Periprava, situated directly across the Danube River from the Ukrainian border. In September, Russia launched drone attacks on cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. The trend has continued throughout the first days of October &#x2014; 32 drones targeted Ukraine on Oct. 1, 105 on Oct. 2, 19 on Oct. 3, and air raid sirens and reports of drones across Ukraine have already been registered on Oct. 4. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-debris-found-in-danube-delta-romanian-defense-minisry-confirms/	2024-10-04T13:41:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/photo_2024-03-04-22_31_00.jpeg
Burning horizon: As Russia makes gains near Pokrovsk, civilians remain frozen in inaction	SELYDOVE, Donetsk Oblast &#x2013; &#x201C;Kostia! Kostia?&#x201D; Despite their volume, the volunteer&#x2019;s calls dissipate in the strong winds coursing through the central streets of Selydove. This is the most dangerous part of any evacuation operation in a front-line city: making visual contact with civilians who have agreed to leave. Russian soldiers are only about one and a half kilometers away from these streets, putting anything that moves around here, people or vehicles, military or civilian, a potential target for a Russian shell or drone. The skies on this warm autumn morning are clear, putting everything in view of Russian eyes in the sky; the only consolation is the strong breeze, which might cause problems for the drone pilots. With no telephone or mobile connection, these rendezvous are organized by word of mouth or the occasional phone call that gets through, and it is rare that everything goes to plan. Volunteer Serhii driving a car in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)This time, Kostiantyn, who evacuation volunteer Serhii had agreed to pick up at this time and location, is nowhere to be found. A key urban milestone in Moscow&#x2019;s offensive towards the key strategic city of Pokrovsk, Selydove saw Russian forces close the distance to its outskirts in a matter of a couple of weeks over August. As of early October, this mining city with a population of about 21,000 before the full-scale invasion looks now to become the latest in a series of &#x201C;fortress&#x201D; cities in Donetsk Oblast, urban and industrial areas where Ukrainian forces have made a frantic defensive stand. Throughout this summer and continuing into autumn, Russia has consistently focused offensive efforts on the southern half of the remainder of Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk Oblast. After first making a beeline for the city of Pokrovsk itself, the offensive slowed in early September, instead turning south in an attempt to cut off a large group of Ukrainian forces. A school destroyed by a Russian glide bomb in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)In contrast to most other front-line cities, many buildings, even windows, were still more or less intact in Selydove, a testament to the speed and recency with which the fighting arrived here. This speed, this rapid transformation of a city from sleepy mining town to active battle zone, inevitably caught many of the civilians in Selydove unprepared. As Russian forces begin their time-honored tradition of raising a city to the ground before assaulting the ruins, local police no longer enters the city, while fewer and fewer volunteers are willing to help evacuate the locals in fear of drone attacks. Those civilians who have remained now find themselves in a world where all life in Selydove is being snuffed out bit by bit, and questions of life and death can be decided in an instant. Parking his car under a tree, Serhii ponders his next move, periodically calling out for Kostiantyn. This isn&#x2019;t unusual: anything could have changed for local civilians since last making contact with volunteers: spontaneous decisions or split-second tragedies can change things in an instant, and if the volunteer can&#x2019;t find the person quickly, it&#x2019;s best to move on before they themselves become a target. Serhii, 36, who himself hails from Donetsk Oblast and declined to give his last name because of concerns for his contacts in the occupied territories, has evacuated dozens of people from some of the hottest parts of the front line since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)A cat rests in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Suddenly, an old Lada crawls past along the street: in it, two large shirtless men and a younger woman in the back. Serhii flags the locals down, asking if they know Kostiantyn and where he might be. After a short conversation, he jumps into the back without a second thought, promising to be back within about fifteen minutes. Selydove seems quiet as that time passes, but not for long: one after the other, two Russian glide bombs fall within a few hundred meters. Carried by the breeze between the high-rise apartments, the dust that soon flows around the city carries the unmistakable smell of gunpowder. Tension builds as time passes, before it is broken by the return of the same Lada down the central street, only this time, something is clearly wrong. There is no sign of Serhii, and instead of him, the locals have tied a cow to the back of the car, ambling down the road at an absurdly slow pace. &#x201C;He got out back there, two blocks down,&#x201D; one of them says, pointing down the central street, right in the direction of Russian forces. &#x201C;But careful, where he got out was right where the bombs landed later.&#x201D; Local residents in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Walking in that direction and expecting the worst, Serhii emerges onto the road with a stubborn frown on his face, covered in dust and with a heavy cardboard box in each hand. To call it a close call is putting it lightly; according to Serhii, one of the glide bombs had landed just two houses away from him, causing plaster and glass to come down on top of him. With him is Kostiantyn Krutskykh 39, and his father, 72-year-old Oleksandr. The father-and-son pair had already fled once, from the town of Kurakhivka further south, which has seen even heavier fighting than Selydove, though is still held by Ukrainian forces. As the group gathers all its things and makes its way back to the van, a drone passes low over the heads of Kostiantyn and his father. With a high-pitched whir sounding neither like a typical FPV (first-person view) drone nor like a DJI reconnaissance version, the quadcopter takes a quick look at the party before flying off in the direction of Russian forces. &#x201C;Kamikaze drones are flying every day here,&#x201D; said Oleksandr. Kostiantyn and Oleksandr Krutskykh in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Over several hours spent in Selydove, dozens of civilians could be seen wandering the city streets, usually alone or in pairs. Often looking to gather water, food, or firewood, the residents stroll with a calm gait, seemingly oblivious to the constant danger of death from above. With the arrival of strangers, some approach Serhii to ask about evacuation, or in one case, just for a cigarette. Residents often hope the volunteers will help evacuate pets, livestock and heavy personal belongings &#x2013; requests that often don&#x2019;t match what people like Serhii are willing to risk their lives for. &#x201C;People are holding on to their property, but even when they lose most of it, they cling to whatever is left,&#x201D; said Serhii. &#x201C;By the time they change their minds, there is often nobody left to bring them out.&#x201D; Dragon&apos;s teeth fortifications in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Asked how he understood the war that had come to his doorstep, he paused before answering. &#x201C;If there was peace here and people could live&#x2026;&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I lived my whole life here, what kind of position can I have towards the bombing, towards the burning houses of my neighbors?&#x201D; Serhii&#x2019;s second-to-last stop is at a nearby Orthodox church, a little further from the front line, where one more person had left a request to evacuate. Once again, nobody is waiting at the rendezvous point, so Oleksandr looks inside the church, where his family used to go before he moved to Kurakhivka. At a cramped table in the entrance room, three middle-aged women sit with a pen and paper in hand, scrawling away at long passages of texts. Local resident Valentyna at a church building in Selydove, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 6, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We are copying out prayers,&#x201D; said one of the women, surprised that it might be seen as a strange activity.&#x201D; &#x201C;When there is shooting and it is scary,&#x201D; continued another of the women, 64-year-old Valentyna, &#x201C;we think that reading a prayer like this, God and the Virgin are protecting us.&#x201D; The person Serhii and Oleksandr were looking to find had gone days ago, the women said. Saying farewell to Oleksandr with a tearful embrace, Valentyna rejoins the other women in writing her prayers. Compared to Selydove, the city of Pokrovsk seems like a haven. Explosions can be heard regularly in the distance, but it is clear that they come from battles in the vast fields southeast of the city, where Russian forces continue to make incremental gains despite fierce Ukrainian resistance. Largely empty as they are, the streets and public spaces are still mostly intact; flower beds full of roses, the symbol of Donetsk Oblast, are in full bloom, taken care of by local municipal workers until the very end.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Once the pride of modern Pokrovsk, the Bulvar shopping complex, where Ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike would sip flat whites and eat avocado toast in a comfortable trendy interior just a month earlier, has been closed and boarded up. This is what 10 kilometers from Russian positions looks like: just far enough for most of the urban area to be outside the range of tubed artillery fire and suicide drones, and in turn, just far enough for some semblance of normal life to continue. But for the foreseeable future, life in Pokrovsk will be anything but normal, and local authorities here are doing their best to make it clear. As of late August, the official curfew was extended to 20 hours, from 3 p.m. to 11 a.m. in the morning. Meanwhile, complementing the large billboards emblazoned with the single word &#x201C;Evacuation&#x201D; all over the city, police cars conduct constant laps of the city streets with loudspeakers reminding the remaining residents of the need to pick up and leave. Likely in an effort to hamper Ukrainian military logistics in the area, all three main road bridges in the city were also destroyed by Russian forces in the first weeks of September. Several people who spoke to the Kyiv Independent in central Pokrovsk had already made the decision to leave, and were using this precious time in relative safety to gather their belongings and prepare. Residents gather drinking water from a humanitarian distribution point in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 9, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We didn&apos;t think that the war would come to Pokrovsk,&#x201D; said 50-year-old Liudmyla as she filled a dozen water bottles at a drinking water distribution point before leaving the next day. &#x201C;We can hear that artillery is beginning to reach the city. That&apos;s when things start getting really dangerous.&#x201D; Hailing from a village outside now-occupied Volnovakha further south in Donetsk Oblast, Liudmyla took her family first to occupied Donetsk, before making the difficult journey back to Ukrainian-held territory. Still, in a practice that is common with internally displaced people in Ukraine, her family chose not to move too far from home, despite the chance that the war would come knocking again. &#x201C;I want to go home, to my own bed,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;But the most important thing is that everyone is alive. There are good people everywhere... well, maybe more bad people now that there is war.&#x201D; As quiet as it is during the day in Pokrovsk however, the coming of night brings with it danger and destruction. Driving down a quiet row of residential houses, the color palette on the street makes a sharp jump from autumn greens and browns to dark gray and black. The smoldering ruins of three residential houses mark the spot where a Russian glide bomb struck late the previous evening. One resident, a middle-aged man who was at home during the strike, sits despondently in front of what is left of his house, having miraculously made it out with just a few light scratches and burns. Firmly declining to speak about the ordeal, the man remains waiting for friends to pick him up before they go to file for government compensation. In the house opposite, which burned down in the hours after the strike 72-year-old coal miner Anatolii Firsov, who has lived in Pokrovsk all his life, searches through the remains of the house, doing his best to salvage the belongings of his friends, who also survived the attack but were taken to hospital with more serious wounds. &#x201C;There is nowhere to live anywhere,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People are leaving Kharkiv, Sumy, from here, where are they all going to live? Donbas was always the most densely-populated part of Ukraine.&#x201D; As he loads what he can save into his old car, including his friend&#x2019;s playful young tabby cat, Firsov tries to maintain an upbeat attitude. &#x201C;Of course I hope I will be able to stay, I hope everything stabilizes, and everything returns to its place, and it will be alright.&#x201D; Local resident Anatolii in front of the burned remains of a house after a Russian glide bomb strike in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 9, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)But with no end to the Russian offensive in sight, and with countless examples of the fate of those cities caught in its path, the grim prospects for his future here are hard to deny. &#x201C;Even if I wanted to live under occupation, what would be the point if everything is going to look like this?&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Of course I am considering all options. Once I see the whole horizon burning, I will get in my car and leave, wherever my eyes take me.&#x201D; Watch the video version of this story on the Kyiv Independent&apos;s YouTube channel: Hi, this is Francis Farrell, cheers for reading this article.

Ukraine hits ammunition depots with domestic weapons in an attempt to disrupt Russia's logistics	Over the past several months, the war had gradually moved deep inside Russian territory. In September, Ukraine targeted depots in the Russian towns of Tikhoretsk and Toropets with drones, setting ablaze over 30,000 tons of ammunition, which allegedly included ballistic missiles. The warehouse in Toropets was supposed to withstand a nuclear strike, as promised by the Russian authorities, but it failed to cope with Ukraine-produced drones. Ukrainian strikes destroy weapons, and the Kremlin&apos;s logistics, which, when damaged in the rear, stall Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. Michael Bohnert, a licensed engineer at RAND research organization, told the Kyiv Independent that there are a variety of other targets that, as ammunition depots, are spread out across Russia. A screenshot from a video purportedly showing the moment an ammunition depot in Tver Oblast, Russia explodes on Sept. 18, 2024. (Olexander Scherba / Telegram)Bohnert lists rail yards and port infrastructure, and &quot;many other dual-use facilities that might also be considered long-term targets.&quot; &quot;So, instead of just hitting the depot, hitting the access points to the depot might be just as valuable in the longer term,&quot; Bohnert added. Over the past two years, drone production in Ukraine has scaled up a hundred times. When the Army of Drones project was launched by the state in July 2022, seven Ukrainian manufacturers were able to supply drones to the state. As of August 2024, there are now 87 of them, according to the Digital Transformation Ministry. In late September, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Ukraine plans to produce several million drones in 2025 to &quot;prevent Russia from gaining an advantage in this area.&quot; Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 1 that Ukraine can produce four million drones annually. Some of Ukraine&apos;s most successful attacks against Russia were carried out using the so-called &quot;drone swarm&quot; tactic when Ukrainian forces launched dozens of drones at once, which can now travel over 1,500 kilometers (933 miles), to overload the Russian air defense system. According to Bohnert, &quot;there&apos;s a significant bottleneck&quot; in Russia when it comes to producing additional air defense systems. &quot;Given how many air defenses have been at the front protecting front-line troops, Russia simply doesn&apos;t have enough air defense systems to cover all its (valuable) locations. So, if it&apos;s going to defend any depots better, it will have to take air defense systems either from the front or from protecting (Vladimir) Putin or other critical infrastructure,&quot; the expert added. According to Bohnert, Russia must start from scratch regarding its air defense. It was mainly designed to defend against high-altitude air targets, like fighter jets, but not against cruise missiles or drones that maneuver at low altitudes. Another problem that Russia hasn&apos;t yet solved is the vast territory that the air defense now must cover. &quot;Russia needs three times as many air defense systems as it has now. We&apos;re talking about thousands of systems,&quot; Bohnert said, adding that improving air defense could take a long time. Strikes on facilities in the Russian towns of Tikhoretsk and Toropets destroyed a tonnage that is considered &quot;the largest loss of ammunition&quot; in Russia during the all-out war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in its intelligence report. One of Ukraine&apos;s latest strikes on Sept. 29 targeted another arsenal in the Russian village of Kotluban, as confirmed by Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. However, according to the satellite imagery, the strike did not directly hit the depot. Despite the lack of visible damage on satellite imagery, the strike could still make the facility more vulnerable to further attacks and affect its logistics, which also influences the waging of war, Bohnert said. A Ukrainian &quot;Leleka&quot; reconnaissance drone unit from the 80th Air Assault Brigade operates at a position in Donbas. (A part of the image has been blurred to comply with Ukrainian military regulations.) Drones have been an essential part of warfare since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb, 24, 2022. (Laurel Chor/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;If you launch 10 strikes with drones, and then the facility can&apos;t unload or store new munitions for 5 hours, 6 hours, or 8 hours, by itself, it is a major effect because that facility isn&apos;t working for a day. It might not have damaged anything, but it&apos;s still going to have a battlefield impact because those munitions aren&apos;t going to reach the front line,&quot; he added. In early October, Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Havryliuk mentioned on national television that Russian forces still have an advantage in the amount of artillery shells used on the front line. However, according to him, the ratio has decreased nearly threefold since the start of the year, from 1:8 to 1:3. Russia already adjusted its logistics at the tactical and operational levels after Ukraine targeted Russian military sites with HIMARS strikes in late 2022, Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;However, large, strategically relevant depots were not moved because they were not considered under serious threat, especially given Ukraine&apos;s lack of high-end, long-range precision strike capabilities and the prohibition of using Western-donated weapons against targets deep into Russian territory,&quot; Borsari added. The expert noted that Ukrainian strikes on ammunition depots, which store significant amounts of equipment and require time and extensive resources to relocate, certainly impact Russian operations, especially if the equivalent of months of ammunition production, including &quot;consumable artillery shells, sophisticated and expensive missiles,&quot; is destroyed. &quot;This can create resupply issues for both Russian targeteers tasked with deep-strike missions and artillery units in areas of the front line that rely on that specific depot. As a result, the tempo of Russian offensive operations can slow down in the affected sectors while also decreasing the fire volume on Ukrainian troops,&quot; Borsari added. Yet, Russia is still continuing its offensive in Donetsk Oblast and is trying to conduct a counter-offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian troops control parts of the territory. On Oct. 1, Russia occupied Vuhledar, in Donetsk Oblast, a Ukrainian stronghold that the country successfully defended for over two years. If Russia tries to continue its operations, it may lack logistical capacity, given its dependence on railways, specific arms depots. This could lead to a protracted problem with rerouting, which would reduce the efficiency of Russian strikes, according to Bohnert. &quot;It&apos;s not declining fast enough to make a huge difference, but it might change over the next twelve months. Does this mean that Russia is going to stop? No, but it will reduce its effectiveness,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-ammunition-depots-with-domestic-weapons-to-disrupt-russias-plans-for-further-swift-assaults/	2024-10-04T12:50:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156412238.jpg
Russia lost more elite soldiers in 1 year near Vuhledar than in 10 years of Chechen War, BBC reports	Russia&apos;s elite Marines have suffered four times higher losses during a year of fighting near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast than during 10 years of the Second Chechen War, the BBC News Russia reported on Oct. 4. Kyiv&apos;s forces announced the withdrawal from the key Donetsk Oblast settlement on Oct. 2 after Russian forces swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and entered Vuhledar itself. Lying in the southern part of the region, roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vuhledar has faced a heavy Russian onslaught since 2022. The elite 155th and 40th marine brigades of the Russian Armed Forces, also known as the Black Berets, were involved in the storming of the city, supported by armored vehicles. The marines were also assisted by motorized rifle units manned by mobilized and volunteer personnel. According to the BBC, at least 211 marines from the 155th Brigade were killed during the battle for Vuhledar, with another 42 missing. This far exceeds the unit&apos;s losses during the decade-long Second Chechen War in 1999-2009, the media outlet&apos;s report showed. BBC journalists were also able to confirm the deaths of 72 Russian soldiers from the 40th Brigade. According to the BBC, the seriousness of the losses is confirmed by the fact that both brigades began using Storm-Z units made up of convicts. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade had defended Vuhledar, the key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years without rotations. After withdrawing from the town, the 72nd Brigade&apos;s troops moved to a new defense line to continue holding back Russian forces, Arsenii Prylepko, a spokesperson for the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Hromadske. Two undisclosed soldiers from the same brigade told Suspilne that their unit continues to hold the defenses in the same direction, near the occupied city. According to one of the service members, some battalions that suffered significant losses during the battles for Vuhledar will be based in Donetsk Oblast, 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) from the front line. &quot;During this time, they are going to be replenished. The rest of the units will hold the defense in this direction,&quot; the soldier said. Another soldier said the brigade remains in the same area because &quot;there is no one to replace it.&quot; During his address on Sept. 30, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine faces a &quot;very challenging&quot; situation on the front lines. Apart from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-marines-losses-vuhledar/	2024-10-04T12:24:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325594-2.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Oil depots on fire in 2 Russian regions	Key developments on Oct. 4: Fires broke out at two oil depots in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast and Perm Krai overnight on Oct. 4, local authorities reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, its air defense downed six Ukrainian drones over Voronezh Oblast, six over Belgorod Oblast, one over Rostov Oblast, and one over the Azov Sea. Ukrainian soldiers attacked the Annanefteprodukt fuel and lubricants storage base near the village of Anna in Voronezh Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. It was not specified what kind of weapon was used in the attack. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent later that the oil depot was struck by drones operated by the SBU. According to the source, the oil storage facility housed 20 tanks with fuel and lubricants. &quot;It was confirmed that at least one of the vertical tanks was hit,&quot; the General Staff said. Alexander Gusev, the Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed that an empty tank at an oil storage facility was hit during the drone attack. A large-scale fire also broke out at an oil depot in the village of Osentsy in Perm Krai. Russia&apos;s Perm Krai lies around 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) northeast of Ukraine. The fire engulfed fuel tanks and spread over 10,000 square meters, the Russian Emergency Ministry reported. No casualties were reported either region. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Russia&apos;s claims. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. Russian forces are less than 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the outskirts of the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 4, said Serhii Dobriak, the head of Pokrovsk&apos;s military administration. The eastern front near Pokrovsk has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The city is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. Speaking on national television, Dobriak said that Russia attacked civilian infrastructure in Pokrovsk with guided aerial bombs a day earlier, injuring people. &quot;(Critical infrastructure) is damaged or destroyed from almost 80%. The enemy leaves us without electricity, water, and gas,&quot; he added. Residents of the northern part of Donetsk Oblast will be left without water supply for an &quot;indefinite period&quot; due to Russian attacks, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 3. Around 13,000 people, including 94 children, remain in Pokrovsk as the evacuation is ongoing. The town had a population of around 60,000 in January 2022. As the security situation deteriorates, Pokrovsk&apos;s train station was closed for civilian evacuations earlier this month. Evacuations now depart from the train station in Pavlohrad in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a city 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Pokrovsk. At least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, said Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs). According to Tsymbaliuk, due to the lack of international oversight, the real number of deaths in Russian prisons could be much higher. Most Ukrainian soldiers who were released had never been visited by the Red Cross representatives while in Russian captivity, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in July. Russia refuses to confirm the captivity or whereabouts of thousands of Ukrainian POWs, the representative added. &quot;Of course, not all the bodies are returned, and many are not even confirmed by Russia as being in captivity,&quot; Tsymbaliuk said. There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Oct. 4 that at least 93 Ukrainian prisoners were summarily executed on the battlefield, a figure not including those killed in places of detention. Sixteen POWs appeared to have been shot by Russian forces after surrendering on the front line near Pokrovsk, the prosecutors said on Oct. 1. This is the largest recorded case of mass execution of surrendered soldiers on the battlefield. Ukraine and Russia have conducted 57 prisoner exchanges since the outbreak of the full-scale war. A total of 3,672 Ukrainians have been brought back from Russian captivity. Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was one of the subjects at Ukraine&apos;s peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June. The EU is moving toward a sanctions package against Iran over providing ballistic missiles to Russia amid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 4, citing undisclosed sources. The U.S. confirmed in September that Tehran had supplied Russia with short-range Fath-360 ballistic missiles as another step in its growing military cooperation with Moscow. Kyiv, Washington, and other Western countries subsequently imposed new economic restrictions against Iran, which already faces heavy sanctions over its nuclear program and backing of militant groups in the Middle East. According to Bloomberg, the EU sanctions would target roughly a dozen individuals and entities, which includes firms involved in the engineering, metals, and aviation sectors. The step should be reportedly approved by the upcoming EU summit in Brussels, scheduled for Oct. 16-18. This package would only be the first step and additional listings are under consideration, the sources told Bloomberg. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. Tehran has repeatedly denied backing Russia in the war. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian claimed during a U.N. meeting in September that his country has never supported Moscow&apos;s invasion and denied the supplies of ballistic missiles. Ukraine&apos;s military said on Sept. 29 that it had destroyed a Russian arsenal in Volgograd Oblast, which had allegedly received a shipment of Iranian missiles shortly before the strike. President Volodymyr Zelensky began a visit to Sumy Oblast on Oct. 4 with a meeting with soldiers of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Russia has intensified strikes against Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region lying at Ukraine&apos;s border with Russia, since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast. Ukraine started its offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements since then. Zelensky listened to reports from the commanders and awarded soldiers during the visit. &quot;Thank you for your service in defending our state. I thank all the commanders, sergeants, and soldiers for the Kursk operation, which greatly helped motivate those who give us weapons,&quot; the president said. During the visit, Zelensky also met with the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the top command and control body for all branches of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and security apparatus, to discuss protecting infrastructure, Ukraine&apos;s energy sector, and air defenses. The president listened to reports from Ukrainian military commanders, including the Air Force and the Operational Command East, as well as from Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;There are solutions to support the region, and there will be separate meetings on the energy sector in Sumy Oblast and our other border regions. Before winter, the most important thing is to have a safety margin,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-depot-in-russias-voronezh-oblast-oil-depot/	2024-10-04T11:42:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-04-083245.png
Russia has summarily executed at least 93 Ukrainian POWs on battlefield, top prosecutor says	Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4. Yurii Belousov, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, explained that 80% of these cases were recorded in 2024, but the trend appeared already late last year. &quot;Since November 2023, the approach of the Russian military toward our prisoners has significantly changed for the worse,&quot; Belousov said. The largest recorded case of mass execution of Ukrainian POWs was reported on Oct. 1. Sixteen prisoners were shot by Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast in a single instance, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. According to Belousov, these victims included soldiers from two different units. The prosecutors tentatively identified the executed POWs but continue verifying the information &quot;out of concern for their loved ones.&quot; The prosecutor said that other Ukrainian prisoners have been killed by Russia in places of detention. He reminded a case recently reported by the U.N. of 10 POWs dying of &quot;torture, lack of medical care, and dire health conditions.&quot; Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, said earlier on Oct. 4 that at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;The murders and torture of prisoners are not an accident, but a purposeful policy of the Russian military and political leadership,&quot; Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-summarily-executed-at-least-93-ukrainian-pows-on-battlefield/	2024-10-04T11:18:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg

Belarus sentences 12 to prison over sabotage of Russian A-50 military plane	The Minsk City Court sentenced 12 people to prison over sabotage of the Machulishchy military airfield in Belarus last year, the Viasna human rights group said on Oct. 4. Some of the sentences were handed down in absentia. The airfield near Minsk has been used by the Russian military during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. Belarusian partisans allegedly carried out the sabotage on Feb. 26, 2023, damaging a Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft. The suspects were charged with up to 11 criminal articles, including terrorism and treason, and sentenced to two to 25 years in prison. This included those who were not accused of direct involvement in the sabotage and may not have known about its preparation, RFE/RL&apos;s Belarusian service reported. The behind-the-closed-doors trial began on Aug. 19. As part of the case, the court sentenced Ukrainian citizen Mykola Shvets, named by the Belarusian authorities as the &quot;main perpetrator&quot; in the sabotage, to 25 years in prison in absentia. Viasna said six other sentences were also issued in absentia. Shvets was detained in March 2023 but was released in June of that year alongside four other Ukrainian citizens detained in Belarus, as well as others held by Russia. The A-50 aircraft provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets. The Russian Air Force lost two of these planes in early 2024, one in January and another on Feb. 23, to Ukrainian attacks. One such aircraft costs around $330 million. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Feb. 25 that Russia has only six planes of this model left in service. The aircraft damaged in Belarus is reportedly undergoing repairs at a facility in Taganrog, Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-sentences-12-over-sabotage/	2024-10-04T10:13:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/A50-rus-aircraft.png
Switzerland has not changed its position' on peace in Ukraine — ambassador clarifies stance on China-Brazil initiative	Switzerland did not sign any communique after the presentation of the China-Brazil peace plan at the U.N. General Assembly in September, participating merely as an observer, Swiss Ambassador to Ukraine Felix Baumann told Interfax Ukraine in an interview published on Oct. 4. Brazil&apos;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva touted his peace plan jointly developed with China in New York, despite the proposal already being dismissed as &quot;destructive&quot; by Ukraine. Swiss media outlet Blick reported on Sept. 28, citing a spokesperson for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, Nicolas Bideau, that Switzerland expressed support for China and Brazil&apos;s peace initiatives. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry responded by saying that President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula is &quot;the only path to a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace.&quot; Baumann said that Switzerland has not changed its position that &quot;any response to Russia&apos;s full-scale against Ukraine must fully respect international law, the U.N. Charter, and, particularly, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.&quot; The ambassador added that Switzerland believes that all peace plans that respect these fundamental principles should be considered. &quot;This is exactly what we saw in the final communique of the first Ukraine peace summit, which took place in Switzerland in June. This summit was built on previous discussions based on the Ukrainian peace formula and other peace proposals that are in line with international law and the U.N. Charter,&quot; Baumann said. &quot;It was in line with this position that the Swiss Foreign Ministry decided to participate as an observer in the meeting initiated by the Chinese and Brazilian sides,&quot; the ambassador added. In May, Brazil and China pitched a six-point peace plan that called on both Russia and Ukraine to avoid &quot;escalation of hostilities&quot; and &quot;provocations.&quot; It came as a parallel plan to Ukraine&apos;s peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which included a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite the invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. Moscow has previously said it would accept Brazil and China as intermediaries for possible peace talks. While the two countries refused to publicly take sides in the war, China served as Russia&apos;s key economic lifeline and a source of dual-use goods. There have been no direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since early 2022. Moscow named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks. In turn, Kyiv&apos;s 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-china-brazil/	2024-10-04T09:44:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-155097444.jpg
EU readies to sanction Iran over missile shipments to Russia, Bloomberg reports	The EU is moving toward a sanctions package against Iran over providing ballistic missiles to Russia amid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 4, citing undisclosed sources. The U.S. confirmed in September that Tehran had supplied Russia with short-range Fath-360 ballistic missiles as another step in its growing military cooperation with Moscow. Kyiv, Washington, and other Western countries subsequently imposed new economic restrictions against Iran, which already faces heavy sanctions over its nuclear program and backing of militant groups in the Middle East. According to Bloomberg, the EU sanctions would target roughly a dozen individuals and entities, which includes firms involved in the engineering, metals, and aviation sectors. The step should be reportedly approved by the upcoming EU summit in Brussels, scheduled for Oct. 16-18. This package would only be the first step and additional listings are under consideration, the sources told Bloomberg. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. Tehran has repeatedly denied backing Russia in the war. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian claimed during a U.N. meeting in September that his country has never supported Moscow&apos;s invasion and denied the supplies of ballistic missiles. Ukraine&apos;s military said on Sept. 29 that it had destroyed a Russian arsenal in Volgograd Oblast, which had allegedly received a shipment of Iranian missiles shortly before the strike.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-readies-to-sanction-iran/	2024-10-04T08:47:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1775102025.jpg
Russian drone attacks against Ukraine reach record levels but experts warn of worse to come	For the first time since the full-scale invasion, Russia launched drone attacks on cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis for an entire month. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. russia carried out a record number of Shahed drone attacks in September 2024. In total, russian terrorists launched 1,339 Shaheds over Ukraine, 1,107 of which were downed by &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; air defenders.In September, there was not a single day when the russians stopped their terror.&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/zUOGKYFPZu The trend has continued throughout the first days of October &#x2014; 32 drones targeted Ukraine on Oct. 1, 105 on Oct. 2, 19 on Oct. 3, and air raid sirens and reports of drones across Ukraine have already been registered on Oct. 4. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal warned on Sept. 6 that Moscow was planning new mass aerial strikes targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russia carried out a massive campaign of attacks over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23, causing a serious energy deficit and necessitating rolling blackouts across the country. So far, damage and casualties caused by the September attacks have been relatively limited. But experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent warned against assuming Russia&apos;s drone attacks were simply ineffective, saying instead that they&apos;re part of a campaign to weaken and locate Ukraine&apos;s air defenses ahead of much larger attacks in the near future. Russia&apos;s drone attacks were simply ineffective, saying instead that they&apos;re part of a campaign to weaken and locate Ukraine&apos;s air defenses ahead of much larger attacks in the near future Kyiv is one of the cities that has been a target for Russian drones, and on Oct. 3, the Kyiv City Military Administration summarized the tactics used in the September attacks in a post on Telegram. It highlighted that the attacks occur at night, employ drones of the Shahed type, and consist of groups of various sizes, flying at various heights and from various directions. In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, the Kyiv City Military Administration said the capital has been &quot;the number one target&quot; for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;Mass attacks using a large arsenal of air weapons, including daily attacks by attack drones of the Shahed type, are a&#x2026; criminal tactic of the enemy,&quot; it said. &quot;Contrary to all norms of international humanitarian law, the Russian army seeks to destroy the city, its infrastructure and residential buildings.&quot; The Shahed is an Iranian-designed, propeller-driven, one-way, kamikaze attack drone, measuring 3.5 meters in length, with a wingspan of 2.5 meters. Its range, claimed by various sources, varies from 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles) to 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles), and has a maximum flight speed of about 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour. It weighs a total of around 200 kilograms, and carries a high explosive fragmentation warhead estimated to weigh 30&#x2013;50 kilograms. They&apos;ve been deployed in Russian attacks against Ukraine since October 2022. In Ukraine, they are nicknamed &quot;mopeds&quot; due to the sound of their engines, often audible as they fly overhead during attacks. An Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Shahed-136, is being displayed at the Azadi (Freedom) Square during a rally in western Tehran, Iran, on Feb. 11, 2024. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Iran recently unveiled a new version, the Shahed-136B with a range of 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), according to Tehran. Crucially, they&apos;re also very cheap to produce &#x2014; Western media, such as the New York Times, has reported the cost of each Shahed-136 drone to be as low as $20,000, but Russia may be paying a bit more for them. A February leak by a group of hackers from Prana Network revealed Russia and Iran reached an agreement for each Shahed-136 drone to cost Russia $193,000 if ordered in a 6,000 batch or $290,000 in a 2,000 batch. But compared to the cost of cruise and ballistic missiles which can range from $3-15 million each, they&apos;re still cheap. Additionally, in an August 2023 report, U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production of its own Shahed-type drones. &quot;Drones are less expensive than sophisticated missiles, and they have a range that is useful from the Russian perspective, as they can launch them from relative safety, so they&apos;re fairly long-range,&quot; Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think another aspect is their availability &#x2014; they&apos;re easier to manufacture and produce than sophisticated weapons, so it&apos;s not just the cost, it&apos;s how quickly these things can be acquired,&quot; he added. Launching mass waves on a daily basis, even if they&apos;re all intercepted, can have two benefits for Russia, according to Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI). &quot;I suspect one of the reasons might be a desire to run down stockpiles of (Ukraine&#x2019;s) interceptors ahead of the use of more scarce cruise and ballistic missiles,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine has received numerous modern air defense systems from Western allies which have helped protect cities from missile and drone attacks. But the interceptor missiles these systems use are not cheap. One IRIS-T interceptor costs around $450,000, significantly more than the cost of a Shahed drone.

(Gregor Fischer/Getty Images)&quot;Ukraine has gotten progressively better at intercepting one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with capabilities other than air defense missiles,&quot; Kaushal said. &quot;That helps conserve interceptor missiles for when the challenge is not drones but cruise and ballistic missiles.&quot; In terms of the recent uptick in drone attacks, Ukraine will have had to expend correspondingly more air defense resources to deal with them, potentially forcing them to make what Boyd calls &quot;difficult decisions.&quot; &quot;Do we keep our precious interceptors for a larger-scale missile attack, or use them to shoot down drones?&quot; he said. The second benefit to Russian forces is that intercepting drones means exposing Ukraine&apos;s air defense network. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;UAVs can be used as pathfinders, a tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities,&quot; Kaushal said. According to Kaushal, all of this confirms Shmyhal&apos;s warning that Ukrainian cities including Kyiv should expect mass missile and drone attacks in the near future, possibly at a level previously not seen. &quot;I think they&apos;ll ramp it up to the extent they can,&quot; Kaushal said, though he noted there are limiting factors to the number of missiles Russia can launch in any one attack, such as the number of launch platforms available. &quot;Also things like target selection and development, and route planning for the preparation of missile strikes are all time-consuming and human capital-consuming,&quot; he said. &quot;But even so, I&apos;d expect a relative increase,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attacks-against-ukraine-reach-record-levels-but-experts-warn-of-worse-to-come/	2024-10-04T08:32:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173666877.jpg
Car with pro-Russian collaborator explodes in city near occupied Zaporizhzhia plant, intelligence says	A car carrying Andrii Korotkyi, the &quot;head of security&quot; working for Russian occupation authorities in the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, exploded in the nearby Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 4. Russia seized Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s largest nuclear power plant in March 2022. Kyiv has repeatedly accused Moscow of endangering the station&apos;s safety and using it as a tool for nuclear blackmail. The car detonation occurred on Oct. 4 around 7 a.m. local time, according to military intelligence. While the statement did not explicitly say whether Korotkyi was killed in the explosion, a video published by the agency shows a powerful blast inside the car. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video released by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence purpots to show a car with Andrii Korotkyi exploding in Russian-occupied Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 4, 2024. (HUR/Telegram)Korotkyi was a collaborator involved in the organization and execution of war crimes and repression of Ukrainians under Russian occupation, the agency said. Following the seizure of the plant, Korotkyi began cooperating with the Russian occupation authorities, giving them lists of plant employees with their personal data and pointing to citizens with a pro-Ukrainian position. Korotkyi organized events to support the Russian army. He was also a member of the ruling United Russia political party and headed the Russia-installed town &quot;council&quot; in Enerhodar. Throughout its occupation, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. The plant has already experienced eight complete blackouts, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for supposedly ignoring the fact.	https://kyivindependent.com/collaborator-car-bomb-enerhodar/	2024-10-04T08:15:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/20241004-02.jpeg
Ukraine may be forced to retreat from Pokrovsk by end of 2024, Estonian intelligence suggests	Ukrainian troops may be forced to withdraw from the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, said Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, in comments reported by ERR on Oct. 4. The eastern front near Pokrovsk has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The city is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. Russian forces were located less than 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the outskirts of the town as of Oct. 4, according to local authorities. Over the past week, the average number of Russian attacks on the frontline has been 167 per day, with 50% of them targeting the Donetsk direction of the front line, according to Estonian military intelligence. &quot;In the direction of the town of Pokrovsk, which is at the center of the attacks, Russia has advanced somewhere between 1 and 2 kilometers (nearly 1 mile) in the last week, and the distance to the outskirts of Pokrovsk, as far as we know, is about 5 to 7 kilometers (3-4 miles),&quot; Kesselmann said. If this intensity continues, it is likely that by the end of 2024, Ukrainian forces will be forced to withdraw from Pokrovsk and take up positions &quot;a little deeper,&quot; Kesselmann added. Estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Oct. 4, 2024. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kesselmann also singled out the capture of Vuhledar by Russian troops as &quot;an important event&quot; of the recent week. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade had defended Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years. Russian forces had been attempting to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Vuhledar withstood numerous attacks in recent weeks as Russian forces attempted to encircle the town. Local authorities confirmed that Russian troops entered Vuhledar on Oct. 1. On the following day, Ukrainian forces withdrew from Vuhledar. &quot;In our assessment, Ukrainian units have taken defensive positions approximately 7 to 8 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to the north. And as Ukraine has been forced to withdraw from the town, we will likely see the consolidation of enemy activities in that direction,&quot; Kesselmann said. Pokrovsk, like Vuhledar, was one of Russia&apos;s key targets in the Donetsk sector of the front line this summer and early fall. Residents of the northern part of Donetsk Oblast will be left without water supply for an &quot;indefinite period&quot; due to Russian attacks, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 3. Around 13,000 people, including 94 children, remain in Pokrovsk as the evacuation is ongoing. The town had a population of around 60,000 in January 2022. As the security situation deteriorates, Pokrovsk&apos;s train station was closed for civilian evacuations earlier this month.

Ukrainian officials exposed on alleged corruption, nearly $6 million found	According to the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) two Ukrainian officials from western Khmelnytskyi Oblast alleged of corruption were holding at home nearly $6 million in cash. The homes and workplaces of the head of the Khmelnytskyi Regional Center for Medical and Social Expertise and her son, a senior official in the main department of Ukraine&apos;s Pension Fund in the region, were searched in another case when the cash was exposed. The case concerned the forging of official documents to illegaly register a disability for men attempting to evade military service. At first, the law enforcement found $100,000 and forged medical documents with the names of men with non-existent diagnoses, according to the SBI. &quot;Law enforcement officers found money in the apartment in almost every corner &#x2014; in wardrobes, drawers, niches,&quot; the statement read.

Shooting down Russian targets over Ukraine by NATO countries will 'involve' US in war, Pentagon says	Shooting down Russian missiles and drones from NATO territory over Ukraine would involve the United States in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Oct. 3. When asked why the West could not help Ukraine shoot down Russian missiles as it did during Iran&apos;s recent attack on Israel, Singh said that these are &quot;two very different landscapes and battlefields.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s neighboring NATO countries could help shoot down Russian aerial targets over Ukraine too, but the partners &quot;are not yet ready&quot; for this. &quot;What works in the skies of the Middle East and helps Israel&apos;s defense can work just as well in the skies of our part of Europe &#x2013; in Ukraine &#x2013; helping to save lives,&quot; he said on Oct. 3. &quot;There are specific technical solutions and fully effective tactics for this.&quot; Iran reportedly launched more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Russia regularly attacks Ukraine with dozens of Iranian Shahed-type drones and missiles, targeting civilian infrastructure. According to Singh, Ukraine has successfully used air defense and other capabilities to continue to take back its territory, and Washington is aware of what other capabilities may be needed. &quot;The president has made a commitment that the United States is not putting boots on the ground into Ukraine, but we are supporting Ukraine in their efforts to take back their sovereign territory,&quot; she said. Asked if shooting down Russian air targets from Poland or Romania would be putting boots on the ground, Singh said, &quot;that would be involving us in a war in a different way.&quot; &quot;And right now, we feel that Ukraine has been able to successfully defend against Russian strikes to their cities, to their populations, to their infrastructure. And we&apos;re going to continue to make sure that they have the support that they need to do that,&quot; she added. On several occasions, Romanian authorities have uncovered drone wreckage near their border with Ukraine in the Danube River region. Airspace violations by Russian drones or missiles have been reported also by Moldova, Latvia, and Poland. According to available information, none of the said countries attempted to intercept Russian projectiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/shooting-down-russian-targets-over-ukraine-by-nato-countries-to-involve-us-in-war-pentagon-says/	2024-10-04T02:47:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1459767214.jpg
France to send another 12 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine, minister says	French-German defense company KNDS signed a deal on Oct. 3 for the supply of 12 Caesar howitzers financed by Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said. The news came days after KNDS announced it had opened an office in Kyiv to support Ukraine carry out the domestic maintenance and repair of land systems and produce artillery ammunition. &quot;Increasing the production capacity of our defense industry helps to support Ukraine,&quot; Lecornu said. France has supplied Ukraine with dozens of Caesar howitzers, a self-propelled artillery system capable of hitting targets up to 55 kilometers (34 miles) away. The company said it makes around 800 systems used by or contracted for the Ukrainian army, including the Caesar, the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun tank, and the PzH 2000 armored howitzer. KNDS is also planning to jointly manufacture NATO-standard 155 mm artillery ammunition and produce spare parts with the Ukrainian industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-send-another-12-caesar-howitzers-to-ukraine-minister-says/	2024-10-04T01:41:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1241324225-1.jpg
At least 177 Ukrainian POWs died in Russian captivity, Kyiv says	At least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, said Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs). According to Tsymbaliuk, due to the lack of international oversight, the real number of deaths in Russian prisons could be much higher. Most Ukrainian soldiers who were released had never been visited by the Red Cross representatives while in Russian captivity, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in July. Russia refuses to confirm the captivity or whereabouts of thousands of Ukrainian POWs, the representative added. &quot;Of course, not all the bodies are returned and many are not even confirmed by Russia as being in captivity,&quot; Tsymbaliuk said. There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. As of September, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 84 Ukrainian POWs. Sixteen more POWs appeared to have been shot by Russian forces after surrendering on the front line near Pokrovsk, the prosecutors said on Oct. 1. This is the largest recorded case of mass execution of surrendered soldiers on the battlefield. Ukraine and Russia conducted 57 prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war. A total of 3,672 Ukrainians have been brought back from Russian captivity. Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was one of the subjects at Ukraine&apos;s peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-177-ukrainian-pows-died-in-russian-captivity-kyiv-says/	2024-10-04T00:30:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169573745.jpg
Oil depots on fire in Russia's Voronezh Oblast, Perm Krai	Fires broke out at two oil depots in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast and Perm Krai overnight on Oct. 4, local authorities reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, its air defense downed six Ukrainian drones over Voronezh Oblast, six over Belgorod Oblast, one over Rostov Oblast and one over the Azov Sea. Aleksandr Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed that an empty tank at an oil storage facility was hit during the drone attack and put out later. A large-scale fire also broke out at an oil depot in the village of Osentsy in Perm Krai. Russia&apos;s Perm Krai lies around 1,800 kilometers northeast of Ukraine.

Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast injure 8	Russian forces attacked 14 communities in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast on Oct. 3, injuring eight people throughout the day, the regional administration reported. Russia has intensified strikes against Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region lying at Ukraine&apos;s border with Russia, since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast. Russia struck the region 82 times and targeted the Sumy community with drones wounding eight people, according to the administration. No information was provided on the extent of the victims&apos; injuries. The communities of Mykolaiv, Khotin, Yunakivka, Myropillia, Bilopillia, Richkivka, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Nova Sloboda, Hlukhiv, Shalyhyne, Esman, and Seredyna-Buda also came under attack. Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, artillery, rocket launchers, guided bombs, and drones. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s Kursk Oblast incursion has helped prevent the occupation of Sumy Oblast and its regional center, the city of Sumy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-sumy-oblast-injure-8/	2024-10-03T19:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168180900.jpg
Three Shahed drones cross into Belarus while Lukashenko midair in helicopter	Three Shahed drones flew into Belarusian airspace on Oct. 3 as Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko was traveling by helicopter over the country, according to the monitoring group Belaruski Hajun. The drones, which flew from Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, were spotted flying toward Belarus&apos; Gomel Oblast. Two drones passed over Novaya Guta, heading for Gomel, while another flew over Loyew, also in the Gomel region. Lukashenko&apos;s helicopter was reportedly flying south from his Ozerny residence at the same time. Earlier that day, Ukraine issued an air-raid warning for northern regions due to the threat of Russian Shahed drone attacks. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims made by the monitoring group. This incident comes about a month after the Belarusian Air Force shot down Shahed-type drones over its airspace for the first time, on Sept. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/three-shahed-drones-cross-into-belarus-while-lukashenko-midair-in-helicopter/	2024-10-03T17:00:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Moldova uncovers $15 million Russian-backed plot to influence upcoming elections with bribes and disinformation	Moldovan authorities have revealed a scheme led by a pro-Russian oligarch aimed at influencing upcoming elections by paying ordinary citizens to vote against closer ties with the West. Over $15 million in Russian funds have been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, is accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. The Kremlin&apos;s efforts are part of a broader attempt to undermine Moldova&#x2019;s pro-Western leadership ahead of the EU referendum and presidential elections on October 20. &#x201C;Moldova is facing a phenomenon of voter bribery, combined with hybrid warfare and disinformation, the likes of which our country has never seen before,&#x201D; Moldova&#x2019;s chief of police, Viorel Cern&#x103;u&#x21B;eanu, said to POLITICO. Chisinau has been supportive of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and cracked down on Russian subversive operations at home, expelling dozens of diplomats and embassy staff in July 2023 after revelations of espionage activities. Russia&apos;s invasion sparked fears in Moldova of a possible spillover of hostilities, namely via the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-uncovers-15-million-russian-backed-plot-to-influence-upcoming-elections-with-bribes-and-disinformation/	2024-10-03T15:53:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg
Ukrainian Reuters cameraman injured in Kramatorsk attack regains consciousness after coma, begins speaking	Reuters camera operator Ivan Lubysh-Kirdey, who was severely injured during a Russian strike on a hotel in Kramatorsk on Aug. 24, has regained consciousness and started speaking, according to his wife, Mariia Semenchenko. Lubysh-Kirdey now recognizes everyone, can answer simple questions, and remembers many things, Semenchenko wrote on Facebook. However, he still finds it difficult to speak due to a broken jaw and the medications he is taking. Last week, Semenchenko mentioned that Lubysh-Kirdey had come out of a coma and was taken off the ventilator, but at that time, he had not yet fully regained consciousness. Lubysh-Kirdey is an experienced camera operator who covered the EuroMaidan Revolution as well as the Battle of Ilovaisk in 2014, when Ukrainian soldiers who had been promised safe passage by Russian-backed proxies through a pre-agreed corridor came under attack. The strike on the Safir (Sapphire) Hotel in Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast killed British national Ryan Evans, a security adviser for Reuters, and injured six others, including two local female residents. As well as Lubysh-Kirdey, one other journalist for Reuters was among the injured. In a statement, Reuters said a six-person team had been staying at the hotel when it was hit. The city of Kramatorsk is currently located around 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-reuters-cameraman-injured-in-kramatorsk-attack-regains-consciousness-after-coma-begins-speaking/	2024-10-03T13:34:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/reuters.jpg
Ukrainian Legion launches first volunteer recruitment center in Poland	The Ukrainian Legion has started recruiting new volunteers in the Polish city of Lublin as it officially launched its first enlistment center abroad, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Oct. 3. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first recruitment center in Lublin was launched at the Ukrainian consulate. Over a dozen officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will provide consultations and assistance during the registration. The center is equipped to conduct medical examinations and issue certificates of service eligibility, Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Havryliuk said. The volunteers will be receive instruction at a training ground set up by the Polish side after signing a contract. The introductory training course lasts 35 days. &quot;Later, the soldiers can be sent to one of the European NATO bases for more months to improve their skills,&quot; Havryliuk said, adding that Ukraine has provided uniforms and logistical support, while Polish partners have donated weapons and equipment. Recruitment takes place through applications on the official website of the Ukrainian Legion or through consulates and embassies. During the first days of the recruitment center&apos;s opening in Lublin, 138 applications for interviews were received through the website and another 58 through consular offices, according to the Defense Ministry. Once the applications are processed, the recruitment center staff contacts the candidates for a preliminary interview, clarification of data, and position assignment. Candidates with Ukrainian passports are invited to the recruiting center for an interview with the commander. During this interview, the position is determined, documents are checked, and a referral for a medical examination is issued. If the medical examination is successful, the volunteer will receive a date to sign the contract, usually two weeks after all the checks are completed. The legion was announced as part of the security agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on July 8. &quot;Several thousand&quot; people showed interest in joining the legion as of July 11, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the time. Contrary to his words, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Oct. 2 that the number of Ukrainians willing to join the Ukrainian Legion in Poland has been &quot;too small.&quot; According to Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland has trained about 20,000 Ukrainian military personnel who are now fighting at the front line in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-legion-launches-recruitment-center/	2024-10-03T12:06:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/8f98b1a7b04779a144640363f279fdba2fe1e982.jpeg
Russia would benefit from destabilization' – experts on what the Middle East escalation could mean for Ukraine	Fears of a broader war in the Middle East have been mounting since Iran launched its largest-ever aerial attack against Israel on Oct. 1, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to retaliate while waging a ground incursion into Lebanon. Ukrainians are anxiously following the latest developments of the years-long conflict, which escalated following Hamas&apos; Oct. 7 attack last year, as they assess how the situation could impact the world&#x2019;s attention and support of Kyiv&apos;s defense against Russia. The U.S. is the largest provider of military aid to both Israel and Ukraine, while Iran remains one of Moscow&apos;s closest allies. In recent months, Ukrainian officials have intensified efforts to secure long-term U.S. defense assistance and gain Washington&apos;s approval for long-range strikes on Russian territory ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, which could influence future aid. Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow have strengthened their military and political ties, with Iran allegedly supplying hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia. On the evening of Oct. 1, Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched nearly 200 missiles, including hypersonic ones, at Israel, most of which were intercepted, according to the Israeli military. IRGC said the attack was in retaliation for the recent killings of one of its top commanders and leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas. IRGC claimed that 90% of its projectiles struck their intended targets. Iranian government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Oct. 2 that Tehran was acting in self-defense and had no interest in a wider war in the Middle East, as cited by CNN. However, Iran&apos;s military leadership warned of broader strikes if Israel chose to retaliate.

Director of the Mossad David Barnea (R) also attended the meeting. (Avi Ohayon (GPO) / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)Netanyahu said Iran had made a &quot;big mistake&quot; and &quot;will pay&quot; for it, while Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Haggari revealed that IDF already had plans for a response and would operate &quot;at the place and time we decide.&quot; The U.S., which assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles alongside the U.K. forces, reaffirmed its support for Israel. Several Western nations, including France, Germany, and Spain, condemned the Iranian attack, while the U.N. Secretary-General called for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Israel continues its attacks on Lebanon, Gaza, and Yemen. We asked Ukrainian and foreign experts what they thought a potential large-scale war in the Middle East could mean for Ukraine, whether it could divert Western resources and attention, as well as worsen Israel&#x2019;s relations with Russia. Editor&#x2019;s note: The experts&#x2019; responses were shortened and edited for clarity. a Ukrainian diplomat, former foreign minister of Ukraine (2007-2009) &quot;This escalation (in the Middle East), which we are currently observing, will divert the attention of political leaders and the media (from Ukraine). If Iran continues its aggression and Israel begins to respond, further escalation is inevitable, and we must be ready for it. However, I do not see a direct connection between what is happening with Israel and Iran and Western aid to Ukraine... What we should receive (from the U.S.) is financed from completely different sources than what the U.S. could allocate to Israel. &quot;Russia can hardly help Iran (in the conflict) because it has nothing to offer. It is dependent on the supply of weapons from North Korea and Iran itself... Russia has clearly chosen a side, and it is not the Israeli side. I hope that Israel will finally draw the right conclusions from this because Netanyahu has always wanted to be nice to Moscow and, at the same time, did not refuse to at least somehow help Kyiv. Now, I think he will have to choose a side and not pretend it is possible to &apos;sit on two chairs&apos; anymore. &quot;The main role the U.S. will play here will depend on whether they want to put an end to the Iranian issue forever. We constantly hear conversations about Iran being one step closer to a nuclear bomb... If the logic prevailed in the U.S. that the countries of the &#x2018;Axis of Evil&#x2019; should be dealt with seriously, and not just by expressing concern... I think the situation as a whole would be much more positive, including for Ukraine. If Iran were excluded from the chain of arms supplies to Russia, it would be much easier for us.&quot; an expert on international politics and the Middle East at the Ukrainian Institute for the Future &quot;Any destabilization in the Middle East will have a negative impact on the general security situation, including the security of the European Union. &quot;First, (a larger-scale) war, especially if it drags on, could lead to a temporary increase in oil prices, which would work in Russia&apos;s favor. Secondly, a major war will divert the resources, energy, and attention of the EU and NATO countries (from Ukraine) as they will be forced to use some of the resources to minimize risks that may arise, including those associated with a potential new wave of refugees from the Middle East. Thirdly, from the point of view of international security and international politics, I do not see critical risks for Russia because, despite the vulnerability of their positions in Syria, a (larger) war (in the Middle East) will be helpful for them. They would benefit from chaos and destabilization that would distract the EU and NATO countries from Ukraine. Then (Russia) will be able to re-up its efforts to push Western partners (to pressure) Ukraine (to negotiate). &quot;From the point of view of Ukraine&apos;s strategic interests, it would be better if there was no war in the Middle East and the Israeli-Iranian escalation ended with an exchange of aerial strikes, as was the case in April, and then with freezing of the conflict.&quot; Rockets fired from Iran to Israel are seen over Jerusalem, Israel, on Oct.1, 2024.

(AFP via Getty Images)Omar Oscar Ashourprofessor of military studies at the University of Exeter and the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies &quot;Israel and Russia have their own agreements and disagreements, mainly the agreements were vis-a-vis Syria, the Russian community in Israel and migration from Russia to Israel. You will likely see (Israel&#x2019;s) attempt to try and break down this Iranian-Russian cooperation that may affect Ukraine. &quot;The relations between Russia and Iran in Syria are partly alliance, partly competition... The Russians were not intercepting (Israeli strikes) on Syria because the understanding was that Israel was hitting just Iranian targets, not Russian ones. I&apos;m sure Russia wanted to get something back from Israel (for example), not to help Ukraine. That agreement will be tested if there is a full-scale war (in the Middle East). &quot;Iranians, of course, will be pressuring for Russian help. Israel will be pressuring, too, trying to give Russia something extra to stay away.&quot; a Ukrainian journalist and political commentator &quot;I would not draw direct parallels here. The allies&apos; support for Ukraine definitely does not depend on what is happening in the Middle East. Such a war can redirect media attention, but it should be remembered that the Russian-Ukrainian (full-scale) war has been going on for more than 2.5 years, and people have gotten used to information about it, regardless of whether new conflicts emerge. It (a larger war in the Middle East) would also not affect (Western) military aid (to Ukraine) because it is financed from a different budget. &quot;Of course, a lot depends on what the Israeli response (to the Iranian strikes) would be. If it targets the Iranian oil refining industry, there will be an increase in oil prices, but we are already observing fluctuations in oil prices, and there is no sign of them decreasing. &quot;(The impact of a potential major war in the Middle East on Ukraine) depends on the scale of involvement (of the parties to the conflict and their allies). The American army will unlikely fight in Iran. The U.S. might, at most, agree with Israel on missile or other strikes against Iran. Russia will definitely not participate in the defense of Iran against these strikes with its own missiles and will not intervene in this conflict directly.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/experts-on-what-the-middle-east-escalation-could-mean-for-ukraine/	2024-10-03T11:44:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175529169.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes Russian airfield in Voronezh Oblast, source says	Key developments on Oct. 3: Drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) attacked the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Oct. 3, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was reportedly carried out in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defense destroyed 113 Ukrainian drones overnight, with 25 of them downed over Voronezh Oblast. According to the source, Russian warehouses containing guided aerial bombs, hangars with Su-35 and Su-34 aircraft, and aviation fuel storage facilities were targeted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report. &quot;The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the enemy&apos;s ability to terrorize peaceful Ukrainian cities with fighter jets equipped with KABs,&quot; the source said. Guided aerial bombs known as KABs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia used almost 900 guided bombs against Ukraine over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 29. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast. Newly appointed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 3 for a surprise visit. Rutte&apos;s visit came days after he took the helm as the alliance&apos;s new secretary general. As a Dutch prime minister, he remained one of the staunchest of Kyiv&apos;s allies, taking the lead with initiatives like providing F-16 planes to Ukraine. The NATO secretary general said on Oct. 1 that Ukraine would remain one of his top priorities amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. Speaking at a press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, Rutte reiterated that Ukraine&apos;s path towards NATO is &quot;irreversible.&quot; &quot;Now we are focused on getting Ukraine invited to join the alliance. This is a very important step. It is difficult to achieve. We are focused on this result. We will do everything to get it,&quot; Zelensky said. Following their meeting in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he and the new NATO secretary general discussed the implementations of &quot;the decisions of the Alliance&apos;s Washington summit.&quot; The July NATO summit in Washington ended with the launch of the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allies. The Ukrainian president also talked to Rutte about the possibility of jointly intercepting Russian drones and missiles. &quot;Jointly intercepting Iranian missiles is no different from jointly intercepting Russian missiles, and especially &apos;Shaheds,&apos; which link the Russian and Iranian regimes,&quot; Zelensky said in the wake of fresh Iranian missile attacks against Israel. The Western partners have thus far refused to help Ukraine in shooting down drones and missiles over its territory, fearing this could be seen as a direct involvement in the war. The president also said that &quot;Ukraine needs to strengthen its positions on the front line so that we can increase pressure on Russia for the sake of fair, real diplomacy.&quot; This is why the country needs a &quot;sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, including long-range weapons, the provision of which, in my opinion, is being delayed by our partners,&quot; he added. &quot;Our key goal is Ukraine&apos;s full NATO membership. Ukraine can become the 33rd member of NATO. Ukrainians deserve this,&quot; Zelensky noted. The invitation to join NATO is part of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan that was presented to U.S. President Joe Biden in late September. Russian forces continue striking settlements in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast even when there are no Ukrainian troops present, Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, said on Oct. 3 on national television. &quot;The local population doesn&apos;t understand why they are being hit (by Russian forces) because the (Ukrainian) military is not even nearby. But the locals are suffering, they are forced to hide in basements for several hours and sometimes spend half a day there,&quot; Mysnyk said. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff has been consistently reporting Russian attacks with missiles and aerial bombs on Kursk Oblast since the start of the Ukrainian offensive into Russian territory in early August. Ukraine previously invited the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts&quot; in the Kyiv-held parts of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Moscow has denounced the move as provocation. The Ukrainian military is reportedly providing water, food, and medicine to residents of Kursk Oblast areas controlled by Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are also trying to restore water and electricity, including using generators, according to Mysnyk. &quot;All this falls on the shoulders of the (Ukrainian) military because we comply with all the requirements of international humanitarian law and provide the local population with everything they need,&quot; he added. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Ukraine received a Patriot air defense system from Bucharest, Romanian Defense Ministry spokesperson Constantin Spinu confirmed for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Oct. 3. &quot;I thank every country that helps us with air defense. I am especially grateful to Romania for Patriot systems. Together, we can achieve even greater effectiveness &#x2014; we can put an end to Russian terror by jointly destroying Shahed drones and missiles,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address a day earlier. Hesitant at first, Bucharest decided to donate one of its Patriots in June. The Romanian government issued an order for the system&apos;s delivery last month. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each, but no announcement on their arrival has been made so far. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-russian-airfield/	2024-10-03T11:39:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-03-123858.png
Slovak PM wants to 'restore relations' with Russia after war ends	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said he plans to resume &quot;economic and standard relations&quot; with Russia after the end of Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the RTVS broadcaster reported on Oct. 3. Much like his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban, Fico has consistently criticized Western military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. &quot;If the war ends during my term in office, I will do all I can to restore economic and standard relations with Russia,&quot; Fico told journalists. &quot;The European Union needs Russia, and Russia needs the European Union. Friendly relations with Ukraine will (also) be very important for us,&quot; he added. Fico entered office in the fall of 2023 after he won the Slovak parliamentary elections on a populist, Ukraine-skeptic platform. His term is expected to conclude in 2027. Despite his controversial rhetoric, the Slovak prime minister has often avoided going against EU consensus in practical steps, something that Budapest is notorious for. While promising that Slovakia would not provide a &quot;single round&quot; to Ukraine, Fico has permitted continued commercial military sales to Kyiv. The Slovak prime minister also voiced hope that Ukraine would remain a transit country for Russian exports flowing to Europe. While Ukraine has been a key junction for Russian gas coming to the EU, its contract with Russia&apos;s Gazprom will expire by the end of 2024, and there are no plans to extend it. Slovakia also continues to buy Russian oil flowing through the Druzhba pipeline, which also leads to Ukraine. Bratislava was one of the few capitals granted permission to continue buying Russian pipeline oil amid an EU-wide effort to move away from Russian imports. A conflict arose between Slovakia and Hungary on one side and Ukraine on the other after Kyiv banned the transit of sanctioned Lukoil oil through its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-wants-to-restore-relations-with-russia-after-war-ends/	2024-10-03T11:24:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161156609.jpg
Ukraine receives over one-third of pledged shells from Czech initiative, ambassador says	Ukraine has received more than one-third of the 500,000 155 mm shells expected to be delivered under the Czech initiative by the end of 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Czechia Vasyl Zvarych said in an interview with CTK news agency published on Oct. 3. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told the Kyiv Independent in July that the initiative had secured funds for 500,000 rounds and hopes to finance 300,000 more by the end of 2024. Eighteen countries have pledged support to the initial initiative, with 15 having fulfilled their promises and provided the funds, according to the minister. Zvarych said that Ukraine is currently negotiating with the Czech Defense Ministry to expand the initiative. He also claimed that he had no information about supposed problems with the ammunition recently reported by the German newspaper Handelsblatt. Handelsblatt reported in late September that some of the artillery shells received through the Czech initiative malfunctioned. A small portion of the received shells exploded prematurely during combat, leading to injuries and damage to artillery systems, undisclosed Ukrainian officials told the media outlet. The ambassador suggested that Handelsblatt&apos;s publication was an attempt to &quot;discredit&quot; the initiative, which &quot;has room for development.&quot; Zvarych also expressed hope that the supply will continue in 2025. &quot;It is effective and helps our soldiers on the battlefield,&quot; he added. The ambassador hoped the initiative would become &quot;a tool for investing in Ukraine&apos;s domestic ammunition production.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has increased its (production) capacity, but we need some financial resources to develop it more and be able to produce smaller caliber ammunition,&quot; Zvarych said. Czechia unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners earlier this year amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. Prague is also preparing to launch a new initiative to purchase artillery ammunition for Ukraine in 2025, Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova said in an interview with the Denik N newspaper on July 24.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-over-one-third-of-shells-from-czechia/	2024-10-03T10:42:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
Opinion: Silent victims of sexual violence, Ukraine’s male POWs deserve real support	This article contains descriptions of physical and sexual violence, which may be disturbing to some readers. Reader discretion is advised. Forced nudity during &#x201C;welcome beatings,&#x201D; naked &#x201C;crouch walking,&#x201D; and gratuitous stripping and body cavity searches are but a few examples of the abuse Viktor Lakhno, 26, a former prisoner of war (POW), endured in Russian custody. Ukrainian men detained by Russian and Russian-affiliated forces, including prisoners of war, regularly report that their captors, including penitentiary staff, engaged in sexual violence. Reports include rape, threats of rape, forced penetration with foreign objects, electric shocks to genitalia, and other forms of torture like those Lakhno experienced. The abuse is said to punish, intimidate, demoralize, or extract confessions. Sexual violence has been committed against both women and men. While sexual violence disproportionately affects women detainees, male prisoners are likely to experience it more often than documented. A military psychologist who worked at Sanzhary Hospital, a Ukrainian state-run facility for former POWs, told me that about 80% of the former detainees she assisted had experienced sexual violence in Russian captivity. Tetiana Sirenko, deputy director of the Lisova Poliana mental health and rehabilitation center, estimated that at least half of the former detainees, both military and civilian, reported sexual violence while in Russian custody. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented numerous instances of sexual violence against male detainees in Russian custody. Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office has recorded 114 cases against men and boys, and 202 against women and girls, both civilians and POWs. Given that 57 prisoner exchanges have returned 3,672 Ukrainian military personnel and civilians as of mid-September, and that sexual violence is often unreported due to stigma, fear of reprisals, or lack of safe reporting mechanisms, the actual number of victims is likely much higher. Russian forces captured Lakhno at the Azovstal steel factory on May 17, 2022, following the months-long siege of Mariupol. He spent 13 months in Olenivka and Horlivka prisons in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. In June 2023, he was released in a prisoner exchange and shared his ordeal with me in Kyiv. When I asked if he sought assistance, he said: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t talk about it; we laugh. Everything is seen in comparison. In those conditions, we adapted.&#x201D; Research into the subject in other contexts has shown that survivors may experience psychological distress, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual trauma, and paranoia. If left untreated, these can cause long-term mental and physical health issues. Yet, the options for help are limited. Upon returning to Ukraine, POWs are entitled to four to eight weeks of government-funded medical and psychological treatment. While services are available, Ukrainian groups say they are far from sufficient. &#x201C;Opening up about sexual violence requires time, to allow a sense of safety and therapeutic trust,&#x201D; Sirenko told me. Released POWs rarely get the time they need, as they are usually required to return quickly to their military units. Unreported or undertreated cases &#x201C;might cause further acute symptoms.&#x201D; People hold banners calling for the return of soldiers from the Ukrainian military&apos;s Azov Battalion, currently held in Russian captivity, during a rally at Sophia Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 7, 2024. (Oleksandr Gusev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)A new mobilization law adopted in May could make a difference by allowing former POWs to voluntarily leave active duty or take an extended 90-day break. Time will tell how effective these changes will be. However, the military psychologist noted that many survivors feel compelled to return to the battlefield to avenge their trauma. But without proper recovery, they risk severe mental and physical repercussions. Although some experts report low trust in the army&apos;s psychological services, seeking treatment outside state-run facilities can also be challenging. According to experts, very few psychologists in Ukraine specialize in working with male survivors, particularly POWs. Nor do they have the time needed to build trust with those recently released. The standard rehabilitation process for POWs can itself exacerbate trauma. Released POWs are interviewed by up to five different law enforcement agencies. Experts say POWs may face improper, insensitive questioning from investigators who are pressed for time and resources and are not trained to work with traumatized survivors. Law enforcement officials and others who interview sexual violence survivors &#x201C;either don&#x2019;t inquire about such experiences or do so without proper sensitivity in their tone or clarity in wording,&#x201D; Sirenko said. &#x201C;Many survivors fear these interviews, thinking that nobody will be on their side.&#x201D; Prosecutors working with former POWs said that after the standardized questionnaire, investigators are supposed to ask whether soldiers experienced sexual violence in detention. If they say they did, investigators are not supposed to ask them further about their experiences but refer their case to a special unit in the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. In an attempt to sensitize investigators and mitigate re-traumatization risks, hospital staff say they regularly encourage investigators to listen to recordings of debriefings &#x2013; conversations that psychologists hold with those released during their first week back &#x2013; to help guide their questioning. However, the former hospital psychologist said investigators &#x201C;rarely listen to them.&#x201D; A military psychologist told me that only a small number of investigators, particularly police officers, conduct interviews with the accuracy and empathy required for such situations. &#x201C;If there is no understanding among the institution&#x2019;s leadership of the importance of the psychological aspects of working with survivors, and if investigators don&#x2019;t have the personal qualities to find the right approach, yet another training session won&#x2019;t make any difference,&#x201D; she said. After repeated interviews, testimonies may become rehearsed, which can raise suspicions of espionage. In some cases, investigators may even subject former POWs to polygraph tests to verify their accounts, increasing a survivor&#x2019;s emotional trauma. Ukrainian authorities should ensure that investigators, health practitioners, and others are adequately trained to identify such cases and are equipped to provide timely, accessible, and effective services for men linked to the sexual nature of the abuse, allowing them to recover at their own pace. All survivors of sexual violence need proper services to overcome trauma, as well as access to justice and reparations.

Saudi Arabia's planned oil production hike threatens Russia's war economy, Politico reports	Saudi Arabia&apos;s plan to increase crude production could seriously undercut Russia&apos;s fossil fuel revenues needed for its war against Ukraine, Politico reported on Oct. 3. Riyadh plans to abandon its unofficial price target of $100 per barrel and drive up production to ensure its dominant position in the global market, even at the cost of dropping oil prices, the Financial Times reported last week, citing its sources. Russia is greatly reliant on oil and gas profits, which have represented almost one-third of the country&apos;s total federal revenue in 2023 and 42% in 2022. Fossil fuel profits thus play a key role in funding Russia&apos;s expensive war machine. Alexandra Prokopenko, an economist and fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Politico that a $20 fall in oil prices at current exchange rates would cause Russia a loss of 1.8 trillion rubles ($20 billion) in revenue, which is roughly 1% of the country&apos;s gross domestic product. This would force the country to either cut funding, which is an unlikely step during the full-scale war, or accept growing inflation and significantly higher interest rates, the expert concluded. Saudi Arabia has previously sought to convince other OPEC+ members to cut production to maintain higher prices. However, the lack of coordination and unilateral hikes by countries like Russia reportedly frustrated the Gulf country and convinced it to reverse course. In September, the oil price briefly dropped below $70 per barrel, the lowest since December 2021. Riyadh aims to resume the scale of its production in December even at the cost of prolonged drop in prices, the Financial Times reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudis-planned-oil-production-hike-russia/	2024-10-03T10:13:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1152489863.jpg
Opinion: Why Russia's memory policy in occupied territories leaves some Ukrainian monuments standing	On the night of Jan. 14, 2023, a monument to the great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko was dismantled from the central square of Melitopol, a Russian-occupied city in southern Ukraine. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, said Russian forces removed the monument to eradicate every trace of Ukraine in the city. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made similar assertions. &#x201C;Monuments and museums are destroyed in occupied territories, even if they barely remind one of Ukraine. They destroy books and do everything to incline people to renounce their national identity,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a conversation with Chilean students. However, some monuments to the Kobzar (Shevchenko&#x2019;s pen name) remain standing in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhansk, which were occupied in 2014, as well as in Mariupol, Sievierodonetsk, Starobilsk, Tokmak, Nova Kakhovka, and Henichesk. Monuments to Shevchenko also exist in Crimea, including Simferopol, Sevastopol, and Yalta. How does this align with Zelensky and Fedorov&#x2019;s statements? What is the real Russian memory policy in the occupied east and south of Ukraine? Many of these monuments were erected during the Soviet era, when Shevchenko was both a national and class hero, as many of his poems addressed the enslavement of Ukrainian peasants in the 19th century. Soviet propaganda depicted Shevchenko as a prophetic figure who inspired these peasants to fight for freedom. During that time, monuments to Shevchenko were established in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and hundreds of other cities and villages across Ukraine. In addition to Shevchenko, Soviet historians and literary critics included numerous other Ukrainian writers on the list of prominent communists, such as Ivan Franko, Lesya Ukrainka, and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky. Notably, Russia has not threatened the memory of these figures. For instance, in April 2023, the Russian administration in Melitopol renamed several streets in the city. Their actions contradict Fedorov&apos;s assertion that Russia seeks to erase Ukrainianness entirely. On one hand, many street names symbolizing Ukrainian history were changed. Dmytro Dontsov Street was renamed after Pavlo Sudoplatov. Dontsov was a Ukrainian nationalist thinker, while Sudoplatov was a Soviet agent known for assassinating the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Both men were born in Melitopol. Additionally, Melitopol saw the emergence of streets named after Russian Empress Catherine II, Alexander Zakharchenko (the head of the so-called &#x201C;Donetsk People&#x2019;s Republic,&#x201D; the Kremlin&#x2019;s name for Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast), and Russian propagandist Darya Dugina. Many streets were restored to their names prior to the EuroMaidan Revolution (2013-2014), such as Maxim Gorky, Sergei Kirov, and Red Army. A statue of Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko is seen protected by sandbags placed by Ukrainian authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 27, 2022, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)On the other hand, streets named after Ukrainian luminaries Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, and Lesya Ukrainka remained untouched in Melitopol. Furthermore, the Russian administration did not rename streets dedicated to Oleksandr Dovzhenko (a world-renowned Ukrainian film director), Hryhorii Skovoroda (the first Ukrainian philosopher), and Bohdan Khmelnytskyi (father of Cossack statehood). This suggests a deliberate policy rather than mere negligence. &#x201C;The Public Council, which included historians and public figures, carried out large and painstaking work,&#x201D; said Galina Danilchenko, the head of the Russian occupation administration of Melitopol, in a Telegram post. &#x201C;(The Russian) occupiers say that Melitopol is a presentable city. Therefore, there&#x2019;s a lot of illusion on the streets, such as buildings being painted, roads repaired, and playgrounds established. Flags on every pillar and a huge amount of leaflets and billboards. I haven&#x2019;t seen such a level of propaganda in all my life,&#x201D; an anonymous activist from the Ukrainian &#x201C;Evil Mavka&#x201D; resistance movement, which operates in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, said. However, street renaming did not occur solely in Melitopol. In other occupied cities, streets named after Ukrainian literary figures mostly remained intact. In Starobilsk, streets dedicated to Ukrainian Soviet-era dissidents Ivan Svitlychny and Vasyl Stus were renamed, but Taras Shevchenko and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky streets stayed the same. In Mariupol, streets named after Cossack Hetman Pylyp Orlyk and Ukrainian historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky disappeared, but the names of Taras Shevchenko, Lesya Ukrainka, and Panas Myrny were preserved. To explain this dichotomy, let&#x2019;s examine the Russian propaganda stance on Ukrainian history. Half a year before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin published an essay titled &#x201C;On the Historical Unity of Ukrainians and Russians.&#x201D; In it, he revisits the millennial history of East Slavs, claiming that Ukrainians and Russians share a common origin and history. &#x201C;Taras Shevchenko wrote poetry in the Ukrainian language and prose mainly in Russian,&#x201D; Putin asserts in the article. Thus, the Russian perspective holds that Shevchenko did not renounce Russia as a country but rather its authoritarian and conservative tsarist regime. Putin claims that Ukrainians originally sought Russian patronage. In this context, he references Khmelnytskyi, Skovoroda, and Hohol. Those Ukrainians who wish to sever ties with Russia, according to Putin, are merely a marginal handful, inspired by external intrigue, particularly from the West. He cites figures like Ivan Mazepa (the Cossack statesman who rebelled against Russian rule), Symon Petliura (a politician in the Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic), and Stepan Bandera (the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists) as examples of such traitors. The &#x201C;dual identity&#x201D; of Ukrainians is central to Putin&#x2019;s concept. He posits that Ukrainians are rooted in two cultures simultaneously: one Ukrainian and the other Russian. This duality, according to Putin, is essential for Ukrainians to coexist harmoniously. Recognizing this allows us to understand the Russian logic behind street renaming. Almost all Ukrainians whose names were erased from urban spaces in Russian-occupied cities held strong anti-Russian views. Conversely, those whose names remain are seen as embodying this dual identity, even though many never expressed sympathy for Russia. Consequently, the Russian memory policy regarding Ukraine is more complex than it may seem. Russia does not entirely erase the memory of Ukrainian history in occupied territories but rather reinterprets it through pervasive propaganda. These ideas are not a recent invention. In 2007, an 800-page book titled &#x201C;Russian Doctrine&#x201D; was published in Moscow, serving as a manifesto of Russian state ideology, written by prominent Russian intellectuals. &#x201C;We have to give up the &#x2018;neo-Bolshevik&#x2019; practices used by Russian authorities in the 1990s that exaggerated differences between Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians,&#x201D; the authors write in &#x201C;Russian Doctrine.&#x201D; By neo-Bolshevik practice, they refer to the policies of Boris Yeltsin&apos;s administration, which developed a partnership with Ukraine while not opposing its sovereignty. Putin, therefore, has returned to Stalin&#x2019;s ideas, rooted in the Russian Empire&#x2019;s policies toward conquered nations. But what about Shevchenko? If Russia considers him part of its legacy, why dismantle the Kobzar&#x2019;s monument in Melitopol? Although sculptures of Shevchenko exist in many cities and villages in southern and eastern Ukraine, they rarely hold the status of central monuments in urban spaces. For instance, in Sievierodonetsk, a monument to Shevchenko was established in 1956 in a small square near the drama theater, while the central city square in front of the city council was dominated by a statue of Vladimir Lenin, a key figure in Russian communism. Similar situations occurred in many other cities. Museum employees look at the sculpture of Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda, which was moved from the destroyed Hryhorii Skovoroda National Literary Memorial Museum, in Skovorodynivka, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on May 7, 2022. (Sergey Bobok / AFP via Getty Images)More monuments to Shevchenko were erected after Ukraine gained independence, but their locations were often determined by what space remained available, as central sites were still occupied by monuments to Soviet heroes. In Nova Kakhovka, the first full-size monument to Shevchenko was erected in 2002. As in Sievierodonetsk, the sculpture of Lenin occupied the central square, so the Kobzar statue was placed in a park along the Dnipro River, a block away and somewhat obscured by foliage. Melitopol is unique in this regard because, during the USSR, the main monument to Lenin was not positioned in the central square but on the edge of a major boulevard. The central square was left devoid of monuments until Shevchenko&apos;s sculpture was erected there in 2011, filling the void. The sculpture maintained a prominent position in the central square, with Taras Shevchenko&apos;s statue on a high pedestal drawing the attention of passersby. Consequently, this monument became an eyesore for the newly established Russian administration, as the central square is intended for official ceremonies and celebrations, as well as for memorializing and glorifying key figures and narratives in Russian history, rather than secondary ones. In October 2023, a new memorial, &quot;City of Military Glory,&quot; was erected on the site of Shevchenko&apos;s sculpture. This monument featured a large mosaic panel depicting Red Army soldiers on the Eastern Front during World War II. Local governor Evgeniy Balitsky announced that the Shevchenko monument would be relocated to a less prominent site. However, activists from the &#x201C;Evil Mavka&#x201D; resistance movement reported that they have not seen the sculpture since its removal from the central square, and its whereabouts remain untraceable through open sources. While Kobzar may be considered a secondary historical and cultural figure in present-day Russia, he can never be central. Ukrainian heroes are expected to hold a lower status than their Russian counterparts, as was the case in the USSR. This is why the narrative of World War II is so prominent; the victory of the Red Army over the Nazis symbolized the unity of various Soviet nations under the Kremlin&#x2019;s leadership in defending their Motherland. Ultimately, the Russian colonial doctrine aligns with a real-time memory policy. Russia intensively renames streets, paints murals, and erects monuments in occupied cities. What Putin might term &#x201C;denazification&#x201D; is unlikely to be acknowledged as &#x201C;de-Ukrainianization.&#x201D; The stated aim of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;special military operation&#x201D; is not the extermination of Ukrainians but rather the restoration of Ukraine to its origins. This policy of soft influence and historical reshaping is not a reflection of Putin&#x2019;s quest for historical justice; it has proven effective. Fostering alliances with Ukrainians offers more advantages than attempting to eradicate them. Stalin, for instance, offered enticing career opportunities to the Ukrainian elite in exchange for absolute loyalty, later utilizing Ukrainian intellectuals to mobilize the populace against Hitler. Writers and poets inspired the &#x201C;Ukrainian Soviet nation&#x201D; to resist Nazi occupation through patriotic verses and stories. Russia is not only destroying Ukrainian history and culture; its contemporary memory policy involves weaponizing Ukrainian history against Ukraine, rooting its geopolitical interests in antiquity. It is as if Russia&#x2019;s struggle has a teleological purpose. After all, could there be a more cruel enemy to Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for independence than a Kobzar playing the balalaika?

Gazprom becomes Russia's least profitable company in 2023, Forbes reports	Russian gas giant Gazprom was ranked as the most unprofitable company in Russia last year, ending 2023 with a record net loss of $6.1 billion, Forbes Russia reported on Oct. 3. Gazprom has had a turbulent time since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, as its revenue fell by 30% last year. Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine led to worsening relations with Europe, limiting the operations of the company. At the same time, Gazprom&apos;s net cash flow &#x2013; a metric that deducts operating expenses from the income &#x2013; increased by 5% to $242 billion in 2023. In the first half of 2024, the company also earned a net profit of about $11.5 billion, according to Forbes. The outlet explained that Gazprom&apos;s net losses last year were mainly of an &quot;accounting nature&quot; and resulted from the devaluation of non-financial assets and loss from exchange rates. The Amur Gas Chemical Complex, a joint venture of Russia&apos;s Sibur Holding and China&apos;s Sinopec, had a net loss of $756 million in 2023 and became the second least profitable company in Russia. The start of production at the plant was postponed to 2027 due to Western sanctions on equipment supplies. The Russian e-commerce firm Ozon ($450 million in net losses), the state aircraft corporation Rostec ($360 million), and the social network VK ($360 million) were also among the five most unprofitable Russian companies in 2023. In June, a report commissioned by Gazprom said it would not be able to recover losses incurred from Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine for at least 10 years. The company said exports to Europe are expected to average 50-75 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually by 2035, which is only a third of the gas monopoly&apos;s pre-war exports. The forecast is &quot;grim,&quot; Elina Ribakova, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told the Financial Times at the time. &quot;Gazprom is at a dead end, and they&apos;re very much aware of it,&quot; Ribakova said after reading the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/gazprom-most-unprofitable-in-russia/	2024-10-03T09:35:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Ukraine denies Russian claims about attempted attack on Kursk nuclear plant	The head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council denied claims from the Russian media about an attempted Ukrainian attack against the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 3. &quot;Russia released false information about a HIMARS strike against the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant,&quot; Andrii Kovalenko said on his Telegram channel. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacking or planning to attack the plant since the start of the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August, which was flatly denied by Ukraine. The plant lies roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Ukrainian-held positions in Kursk Oblast, according to the DeepState monitoring site. Earlier on Oct. 3, Russian Telegram Shot and Mash claimed that explosions rocked the nearby town of Kurchatov amid a supposed attempted Ukrainian attack on the Kursk plant. The channels did not specify whether HIMARS rockets were used in the attack. Mash claimed that four missiles and a single drone were deployed, all of which were intercepted. The drone, alleged to be Ukraine&apos;s new Palianytsia model, was flying toward Kurchatov at 11:30 a.m. local time, Mash wrote. Later during the day, at 4:20 p.m., Russian air defenses were used to intercept a &quot;French aerial bomb&quot; that fell 5 kilometers from the power station, the channel alleged. Shot wrote that Ukrainian forces made &quot;four unsuccessful attempts&quot; to strike the plant, causing a fire some 5 kilometers from the plant. Both channels shared footage of smoke rising over what appears to be Kurchatov. Kursk Oblast Governor Alexei Smirnov claimed that a Ukrainian drone was neutralized by electronic warfare means near Kurchatov. Its fall allegedly caused explosions at an outbuilding not related to the nuclear plant. The power station&apos;s management said on Telegram that it is &quot;operating in normal mode&quot; and that the radiation levels are within norms.

(Mash/Telegram)&quot;Obviously, nobody attacked the nuclear plant, there is no point. Russia showed some kind of fire in Kurchatov and a video of an explosion on the ground,&quot; Kovalenko said. &quot;What is the purpose of attacking the nuclear power plan?... It (the explosions) have nothing to do with an attack against the Kursk plant.&quot; The Ukrainian outlet Suspilne also wrote that its sources in Ukraine&apos;s intelligence services refuted the claims about the strike on the plant. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukrainian intelligence services did not respond to a request for comment at the time of the publication. The Kremlin previously accused Kyiv of attacking the plant in late August and invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect security at the station. Moscow was apparently disappointed with the conclusions of the IAEA mission, saying it was hoping for &quot;a more objective and clearer position.&quot; Russia has been occupying Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since March 2022. Kyiv said Moscow has been consistently endangering the plant&apos;s safety and using it as a tool of nuclear blackmail.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-plant/	2024-10-03T09:05:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/-------_---.jpeg
Russia attacking Kursk Oblast settlements with no Ukrainian troops present, Kyiv's military claims	Russian forces continue striking settlements in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast even when there are no Ukrainian troops present, Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, said on Oct. 3 on national television. &quot;The local population doesn&apos;t understand why they are being hit (by Russian forces) because the (Ukrainian) military is not even nearby. But the locals are suffering, they are forced to hide in basements for several hours and sometimes spend half a day there,&quot; Mysnyk said. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff has been consistently reporting Russian attacks with missiles and aerial bombs on Kursk Oblast since the start of the Ukrainian offensive into Russian territory in early August. Ukraine previously invited the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts&quot; in the Kyiv-held parts of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Moscow has denounced the move as provocation. The Ukrainian military is reportedly providing water, food, and medicine to residents of Kursk Oblast areas controlled by Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are also trying to restore water and electricity, including using generators, according to Mysnyk. &quot;All this falls on the shoulders of the (Ukrainian) military because we comply with all the requirements of international humanitarian law and provide the local population with everything they need,&quot; he added. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kursk-oblasts-areas/	2024-10-03T08:07:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820511.jpg
Part of Donetsk Oblast to lack water supply for 'indefinite period' due to fighting	Residents of the northern part of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast will be left without water supply for an &quot;indefinite period&quot; due to Russian attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin announced on Oct. 3. Partially-occupied Donetsk Oblast in the country&apos;s east has been among the most heavily affected regions by Russia&apos;s full-scale war, forcing the majority of its residents to flee. &quot;Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostiantynivka, and nearby settlements where roughly 260,000 people live will have problems with water supply due to massive Russian attacks,&quot; Filashkin said on his Telegram channel. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 2, 2024. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Russian forces damaged two facilities of the Water of Donbas utility company on Sept. 28, damaging the equipment beyond repair, the governor added. &quot;The regional military administration and local authorities are attempting to establish an alternative water supply,&quot; Filashkin reported, adding that technical water is being temporarily supplied from a local river reservoir. Russia&apos;s daily attacks continue to inflict civilian casualties and destroy crucial infrastructure in Donetsk Oblast. Eight people were injured in the region only on Oct. 2. Strikes against civilian centers are accompanied by an advancing ground offensive focused on several axes in Donetsk Oblast, which scored its latest success earlier this week by capturing the front-line town of Vuhledar.	https://kyivindependent.com/part-of-donetsk-oblast-to-lack-water/	2024-10-03T07:56:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2160041934.jpg
Russian losses in Ukraine mount in September, 2nd-deadliest month since start of full-scale invasion	September was the second-deadliest month for Russian forces fighting in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to figures released by Kyiv. Adding up, the daily reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces show 38,130 Russian soldiers were reported as casualties last month. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. This figure is only surpassed by that of May 2024, when Ukraine reported 38,940 Russian casualties. According to an analysis of the Ukrainian figures by analyst Ragnar Gudmundsson, four of the top ten bloodiest days for Moscow&apos;s forces since the launch of the full-scale invasion all occurred last month &#x2013; Sept. 22, with 1,500 casualties, Sept. 28, with 1,470, Sept. 21, with 1,440, and Sept. 24, with 1,400. The data doesn&apos;t indicate where the losses occurred, but Russia has continued to make grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, most recently capturing the town of Vuhledar, Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine has published daily estimates of the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers since the early days of the launch of the full-scale invasion. Initially, there was some skepticism about how accurate the numbers were, which was reflected in the fact that Western nations were at first reluctant to publish their own numbers. &quot;At the start of the war when I was in Moscow, we didn&apos;t speculate on numbers because there was a lot of propaganda flying around,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year. &quot;But it seems to me that over the last year and a half or so, the British, American, and Ukrainian estimates have all come together.&quot; Over the course of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western allies did begin to publicly release their own estimates of Russian losses, and they are broadly in line with those coming out of Kyiv. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; a U.K. Military Intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; Compounding the Kremlin&apos;s manpower issues, Russian defense production facilities are suffering an acute personnel shortage. &quot;You have the Armed Forces and the military industry competing with each other for able-bodied men,&quot; Dr Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in International Politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has drained Russia&apos;s labor market and prompted fierce competition between the military and businesses for new recruits. At the same time, Russia&apos;s all-out war has dramatically increased the production of weapons and military equipment. According to an investigation by BBC&apos;s Russian service, thousands of job ads have recently appeared for shift workers at defense enterprises, enticing workers with triple the standard pay, recruiting young people, and offering rewards for referrals of new hires. At the same time, Russia is currently undertaking several steps to increase military manpower, short of announcing what would likely be a hugely unpopular second wave of mobilization. Instead, Vadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, said in January that around 30,000 volunteer fighters were signing contracts with the Russian military per month. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this figure, and it is not clear if it has changed since then. But the reluctance to resort to another round of mobilization is also forcing Putin to take more unorthodox measures &#x2013; on Oct. 2 he signed a law that exempts defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army. The aim is to conscript 40% of the nearly 60,000 prisoners who are currently held in pre-trial detention centers, according to the independent Russian news outlet IStories. Mathers points out that Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strict ideology around traditional family values and gender roles means that, at the moment, women aren&apos;t being targeted for recruitment in industry or the military. &quot;I think if they get to the point where they say &apos;ok, now we need the women,&apos; that&apos;s when you can say that they have acknowledged that they&apos;re desperate, that they&apos;re really in dire straits,&quot; she said. &quot;That would be a tipping point.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-ukraine-mount-in-september-2nd-deadliest-month-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion/	2024-10-03T07:28:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Lives are more important than buildings' — Zelensky defends Vuhledar withdrawal	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 3 that the decision of the Ukrainian military to withdraw from the front-line town of Vuhledar was &quot;absolutely correct&quot; as it helped save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. &quot;We cannot stop Russia without appropriate weapons. Then, when they destroy the positions of our troops, we must protect their lives because they are more important than any buildings,&quot; Zelensky said in response to a journalist during a joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Kyiv. Kyiv&apos;s forces announced the withdrawal from the key Donetsk Oblast settlement on Oct. 2 after Russian forces swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and entered Vuhledar itself. Lying in the southern part of the region, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vuhledar has faced a heavy Russian onslaught since 2022. Ukrainian soldiers who defended the town &quot;are our people, they are Ukrainian citizens. Therefore, it was correct that they left and saved themselves,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;For the sake of our state, for the sake of their heroic service. It was an absolutely correct step.&quot; The president took the opportunity to call upon Ukraine&apos;s partner to speed up their weapons deliveries to help Kyiv fend off Russian aggression. During his address on Sept. 30, Zelensky said that Ukraine faces a &quot;very challenging&quot; situation on the front lines. Apart from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw slowly. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-on-vuhedar/	2024-10-03T07:14:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Rutte-Zelensky.jpeg
Russia strikes Chernihiv Oblast, killing 3, injuring 4, including children	Russian forces attacked the Koriukivka district in Chernihiv Oblast on Oct. 3, hitting a car that was carrying liquefied gas, Governor Viacheslav Chaus said. At least three people were killed, including a 6-year-old child, while four others suffered injuries and were hospitalized. A 4-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl were among the injured, according to preliminary data. Both children are in serious condition and receiving medical help at the Chernihiv Regional Children&apos;s Hospital, Chaus said. The gas containers that were being transported in the car detonated following the Russian attack. The fire spread to residential buildings. &quot;Did the Russians know where they were hitting? They definitely did. Moreover, they understood all the consequences. Law enforcement must give a legal assessment of the enemy&apos;s actions. The international community must respond,&quot; Chaus said. The Koriukivka district, with a pre-war population of over 80,000, is located on the border with Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast in the north and regularly comes under Russian attacks. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured 41 over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 3. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-chernihiv-oblast-killing-3-injuring-4-including-children/	2024-10-03T06:46:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-03-16_11_11.jpeg
Ukraine receives Patriot air defense system from Romania	Ukraine received a Patriot air defense system from Bucharest, Romanian Defense Ministry spokesperson Constantin Spinu confirmed for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Oct. 3. &quot;I thank every country that helps us with air defense. I am especially grateful to Romania for Patriot systems. Together, we can achieve even greater effectiveness &#x2014; we can put an end to Russian terror by jointly destroying Shahed drones and missiles,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address a day earlier. Hesitant at first, Bucharest decided to donate one of its Patriots in June. The Romanian government issued an order for the system&apos;s delivery last month. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each, but no announcement on their arrival has been made so far. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-patriot-arrives/	2024-10-03T06:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1242099925-1671654146aso5t.jpg
Switzerland to pledge $1.7 billion for reconstruction projects in Ukraine	Switzerland is planning to allocate 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) for reconstruction projects in Ukraine over the next four years, Swiss Ambassador to Ukraine and Moldova Felix Baumann said. One billion of the funds will be allocated to the Ukrainian sectors of self-government, demining, and humanitarian aid. The rest of the money will be used for recovery programs involving the Swiss private sector, Ukraine&apos;s Development of communities, territories and infrastructure Ministry reported on Oct. 3. &quot;To emphasize the seriousness of our intentions, our representative will be working here, who will be responsible for the implementation of this project,&quot; Baumann said during a meeting with ministry&apos;s head Oleksii Kuleba. The Ukrainian minister also named the construction of housing for internally displaced people in Ukraine &#x2014; more than 4.5 million &#x2014; among the priorities of cooperation with Switzerland. &quot;We are interested in intensifying regional programs, and we could expand our cooperation within the framework of the funding offered by Switzerland,&quot; he added. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Bern has provided economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and joined EU sanctions against Moscow, breaking from its tradition of political neutrality. Switzerland also hosted the 2022 Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, which laid down principles for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and recovery, as well as the first peace summit this summer.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-to-pledge-1-7-billion-for-reconstruction-projects-in-ukraine/	2024-10-03T04:14:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/461996631_942657904569058_3464807016422479889_n.jpg
New NATO Secretary-General Rutte arrives in Kyiv on unannounced visit	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated.

Ukrainian drones strike Russian airfield in Voronezh Oblast, SBU source says	Drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) attacked the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Oct. 3, a source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was reportedly carried out together with Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defense destroyed 113 Ukrainian drones overnight, with 25 of them downed over Voronezh Oblast. According to the source, Russian warehouses containing guided aerial bombs, hangars with Su-35 and Su-34 aircraft, and aviation fuel storage facilities were targeted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack on the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Voronezh Oblast, Russia, on Oct. 3, 2024. (Source)&quot;The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the enemy&apos;s ability to terrorize peaceful Ukrainian cities with fighter jets equipped with KABs,&quot; the source said. Guided aerial bombs known as KABs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia used almost 900 guided bombs against Ukraine over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 29. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-russian-airfield-in-voronezh-oblast-targets-guided-bombs-warehouses-source-claims/	2024-10-03T02:33:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-03-123858.png
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 41 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine have killed two people and injured 41 over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 3. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said. Russia attacked Kharkiv with a KAB guided bomb overnight, hitting a residential building and injuring at least 12 people, including a child, local authorities reported. Six women and two men also suffered injuries after Russian forces attacked a number of other settlements in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia attacked the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with kamikaze drones and artillery, injuring two men aged 69 and 89, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. Eleven people were injured in the towns of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Krasnohorivka, and Hirnyk as well as in the villages of Andriivka, Ulakly, and Pishchanka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Two people were killed and eight were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-7-injure-50-over-past-day/	2024-10-03T01:53:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-03_08-43-28.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine launches e-residency for foreigners	Ukraine launched an e-residency program this past week, giving some foreigners remote access to services in the country, mainly the ability to open a business and bank account and pay taxes at a favorable rate. The move is part of the country&#x2019;s wider digitalization efforts to counter both bureaucratic difficulties and corruption launched after President Volodymyr&#x2019;s election in 2019 and the creation of the Digital Transformation Ministry. Much of the inspiration for the program, called uResidency in Ukraine, comes from the success of a similar program in Estonia &#x2014; a pioneer of digital government services &#x2014; which made 64.3 million euros in tax revenue last year. Ukraine is hoping to attract $1 million in tax revenue with 1,000 residents in the first year. It&#x2019;s also about showing the world Ukraine&#x2019;s digital transformation. &#x201C;Now foreign entrepreneurs can experience firsthand the digital services that have long made Ukrainians&#x2019; lives easier,&quot; Oleksandr Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation on IT industry development told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;With uResidency, we aim to share our innovative solutions with the world, enhancing the comfort and convenience of doing business for people everywhere.&#x201D; To obtain e-residency status, foreigners don&#x2019;t need to travel to Ukraine &#x2014; which for the unfortunate reason of Russia&#x2019;s war is dangerous and difficult. Those eligible just have to go to their local Ukrainian consulate to verify their documents. So who can and would want to become an e-resident? So far only citizens of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Slovenia can become e-residents in Ukraine. The program is mostly a good fit for smaller businesses in the IT, gaming, and digital technology sectors, as well as online services in the creative economy like marketing, sales, web design, project management, marketing, and media. Why only these four countries? Slovenia for the simple reason that this country never experienced a significant influx of Ukrainian refugees as the result of Russia&#x2019;s war so their consular services are free to take on some extra requests, the ministry told me. Regarding India, Pakistan, and Thailand, the ministry said that according to their research, there&#x2019;s a strong demand for e-residency in these countries, especially as it gives them closer access to European markets. It&#x2019;s also part of a broader move in Ukraine to reach Asian markets, the ministry said. What are some of the benefits of becoming an e-resident? For one, e-residents can open bank accounts from their phones, with the only in-person involvement the verification step at a consulate. At this stage, e-residency is free. There are no hidden fees, or fees for accounting, and e-residents don&#x2019;t have to pay for accounting through the partner bank, the ministry said. The only costs incurred are taxes and a small fee for banking services. Speaking of taxes, e-residents will pay a tax rate of 5% on an annual income up to 180,000 euros. If they exceed this limit, the tax increases to 15%. The program is still in its infancy, but the ministry told me that during its beta testing phase of the program with nine e-residents the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Whether or not it&#x2019;s successful, I think it&#x2019;s worth noting here briefly that despite the full-scale invasion, despite the missiles and drones descending on Ukrainian cities and towns daily, the government is still taking steps to modernize its economy. According to a recent study by Deloitte Ukraine and Gradus Research, 45% of 1,000 women surveyed toward the end of September said they were considering switching job fields that are traditionally considered to be male jobs. Younger women and those who live in the western, northern regions, and Kyiv were more likely to say they were considering a change. The study also found that higher levels of women are experiencing stress and burnout, with 45% of women saying they are more stressed than last year and 38% saying they are more burnt out. Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn is pictured in Kyiv, Ukraine, at an unknown date. (Volodymyr Tarasov/ Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Ukraine gets a new restoration agency head, finallyFormer Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn is now head of Ukraine&#x2019;s Agency for the Restoration and Development of Infrastructure months after the previous head was pushed out. A bit of background: President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s office barred the former head of the agency, Mustafa Nayyem, from attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin in June, prompting him to resign. Just before, it sacked former Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov. Western partners were pretty confused why the President&#x2019;s Office would make such moves right before a conference on, well, rebuilding and restoring infrastructure and raised concerns over Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to protect its vital infrastructure from Russian attacks. While Kubrakov hasn&#x2019;t said much publicly about his firing, Nayyem cited &quot;systemic obstacles&quot; that limited his ability to do his job. Which of course, makes one wonder if Sukhomlyn will have much luck in his new role. While some in the government assert reconstruction is still a priority, it doesn&#x2019;t feel like it from here &#x2014; in some ways understandable given the difficult battlefield situation and the urgency of making emergency repairs on energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed by Russia before it gets really cold. A glimmer of hope: As mayor of Zhytomyr, Sukhomlyn helped to get the city through winter of 2023 with almost no blackouts with good management of base-level consumption.

The plant was sold as part of the government&#x2019;s Big Privatization drive to raise money for the budget by offloading state assets. It was bought by Ukrainian businessman Bohdan Pukish whose bid was up millions from the original starting price of around $484,000. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development revised its growth forecast for Ukraine in 2025 from 6% to 4.7% over the impact Russia&#x2019;s destruction of electricity generation and transmission capacities is having on the country&#x2019;s economy. Donskoy Ugol Trading House&apos;s CEO, Oleg Knyazev, claimed that negotiations on coal supplies from the Donbas region are ongoing with potential buyers from China, India, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Malaysia. The official, who leads the control and audit department, was apprehended near state nuclear energy agency Energoatom&apos;s office in Kyiv while accepting a bribe of UAH 100,000 ($2,400). The money was demanded in exchange for resolving fuel supply issues. CEO of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company DTEK Maksym Tymchenko told Financial Times that an average of five hours of blackouts is in the best-case scenario where temperatures do not go below -15 Celsius and Russia does not attack energy infrastructure again, which is unlikely.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-launches-e-residency-for-foreigners/	2024-10-03T01:01:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Diia_uResidency_x1080_03.png
Ukrainian plans to search for Volyn massacre remains a 'step in the right direction,' Polish foreign ministry says	The Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance&apos;s (UINR) announcement that it plans to search for the remains of victims of the Volyn massacre is a &quot;step in the right direction,&quot; the Polish foreign ministry said on Oct. 3. The Volyn massacre refers to the 1943 killing of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that was once part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the issue has resurfaced in public discussion multiple times. UINR announced plans on Oct. 2 to begin the search and exhumation of Polish remains in Ukraine&apos;s Rivne Oblast in 2025 in response to petitions from Polish citizens. &#x201C;This is good information and a step in the right direction, but (Polish Foreign Affairs) Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has repeatedly emphasized in talks with Ukrainian partners that we are not waiting for plans, but for a decision. Therefore, we hope that such a decision will indeed be made,&#x201D; Polish Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski told Polish media outlet PAP. Wronski emphasized that Sikorski &#x201C;does not see this issue as a political dispute, but calls on the Ukrainian side to make a civilized and Christian gesture of remembrance for the victims of the horrific events in Volyn.&#x201D; The exhumation and search for Polish graves in Ukraine, related to the Volyn massacre, was a key topic during the Oct. 1 meeting between Polish parliament speaker Szymon Ho&#x142;ownia and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. This issue has been the focus of ongoing discussions between Polish and Ukrainian officials. In September, Sikorski visited Kyiv to address key matters with Ukrainian counterparts, including the sensitive topic of resuming the exhumation and Christian burial of victims of the Volyn events. The Volyn massacre remains a highly sensitive issue in Polish-Ukrainian relations, with conflicting perspectives on responsibility and the estimated number of victims. Polish officials have characterized the massacre as genocide, attributing full responsibility to the UPA, while Ukrainian officials have rejected this label and called for recognizing shared responsibility for the killings.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-plans-to-search-for-volyn-massacre-remains-a-step-in-the-right-direction-polish-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-10-03T00:51:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 149	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 149 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Sept. 22-28, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024, the group reported on Sept. 26 (589 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period.) This is nearly four times as much as the group&#x2019;s profit in January-June 2023 (Hr 6.6 billion, or 165 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). The financial statements were reviewed by PwC and are available on Naftogaz&#x2019;s website. According to Naftogaz Group, its consolidated operating profit for January-June 2024 was Hr 28.9 billion (685 million euros), compared to Hr 14 billion (350 million euros at the average exchange rate) for January-June 2023. The improvements in financial results were driven primarily by increased revenues from the sale of gas, oil, petroleum products, and gas distribution services, Naftogaz Group explained. Additionally, from January to June 2024, the group&#x2019;s companies paid Hr 44 billion (1.043 million euros) in taxes to the state budget, the company said. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 6.1 billion (147 million euros) in taxes to state and local budgets for January 2024 (see Issue 119), Hr 5.3 billion (129 million euros) for February (see Issue 123), Hr 8.3 billion (197 million euros) for March (see Issue 128), Hr 8 billion (189 million euros) for April (see Issue 132), Hr 9.3 billion (215 million euros) for May (see Issue 137), Hr 9.2 billion (203 million euros) for June (see Issue 140), Hr 6 billion (132 million euros) for July (see Issue 143), and Hr 7.2 billion (174 million euros) for August (see Issue 143). As we wrote in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion (2.1 billion euros) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion (172 million euros) to local government budgets in 2023. The group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion (584 million euros) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion (2.3 billion euros) loss in 2022. See our Issue 131 for more detail. Kyiv owes Naftogaz Hr 20.7 billion ($500 million), part of the debt is to be restructured for 15 years. According to EP&#x2019;s sources, the municipal heat supplier Kyivteploenergo (owned by the Kyiv City Council) owes Naftogaz Hr 20.7 billion ($500 million) as of early September 2024. The total debt consists of three major parts, the media outlet added. The first part is Hr 6.4 billion ($154 million) for natural gas consumed before 2022. It is planned to restructure this part for 15 years. The second part of more than Hr 7 billion ($169 million) is the difference in tariffs as of July 1. One would guess that this refers to the amount of debt resulting from the difference between the market prices and administratively set preferential tariffs for households and other consumer categories, although is not entirely clear from the information given by the media. The third one, more than Hr 7.2 billion ($173 million), is the debt to Naftogaz Trading, which can also potentially be settled via amicable agreements with instalments of up to 4 years, EP also wrote. Based on the available information, it is not clear how the &#x201C;third part&#x201D; is conceptually different from the &#x201C;first&#x201D; or &#x201C;second&#x201D; parts, and whether the &#x201C;second part&#x201D; can be restructured like the &#x201C;first part&#x201D; or settled via amicable agreements like the &#x201C;third part.&quot; One would expect to see this type of information in Naftogaz&#x2019;s annual reports, typically as part of management&#x2019;s discussion and analysis. However, although Naftogaz had published such reports since the launch of its corporate governance reform in 2014 (covering the year 2014 and on), it stopped publishing them in 2023. This is all the more remarkable because the company was able to publish an annual report in wartime (covering the year 2021, published in 2022), when it had no supervisory board, while it stopped publishing them after it got a new supervisory board in January 2023. EP&#x2019;s source noted the lion&#x2019;s share of the total debt has accumulated since 2018. &#x201C;Among the cities, Kharkiv and Kyiv are (Naftogaz&#x2019;s) largest debtors today. It is clear with Kharkiv &#x2014; many people have left the city, and utility payments dropped; however, it is the other way round in Kyiv &#x2014; people keep living in the city and paying for these services. The payments only dropped in the first months of the full-scale war (end-February 2022), and then everything leveled off. The question is then, where did these debts come from and &#x2014; if Kyiv&#x2019;s authorities are not addressing them &#x2014; why are they laying (new) asphalt and paving (instead of paying their debts)? In fact, this is happening at the expense of Naftogaz,&#x201D; a representative of the state-owned company said. According to EP&#x2019;s source, a meeting of Naftogaz&#x2019;s supervisory board was scheduled for Sept. 26 to consider restructuring part of the debt. (There were no public releases on this meeting or its decisions from Naftogaz at the time of writing.) EP&#x2019;s source in the government wondered why part of the debt was planned to be restructured for an unprecedented 15 years. &#x201C;Why not eight or ten years, for example, why 15 years? There is no substantial justification for this decision, no one has seen them,&#x201D; he said. As we wrote in June 2024 (Issue 135), Naftogaz assured that it would continue to supply gas to electricity and heat producers to support Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system. According to Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov, the company has the resources to do so. He then pointed out that the debts of large heat and power producers for gas remained a significant problem. &#x201C;We are already supplying gas to these companies at the price set by the state. These funds are necessary for the stability of gas supply, so solving the debt problem is also urgent for the stability of the system,&#x201D; he then said. Chernyshov also added that Naftogaz would continue to supply gas to Kyiv&#x2019;s energy companies in a stable manner. As of June 2024, Kyiv has paid 100% for the gas consumed in the 2023/2024 heating season, he said. See Issue 135 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 68, the government ordered Naftogaz to sell gas at a discount to multiple types of consumers, including households, heating companies, certain thermal power plants, non-household consumers from the defence sector, and regional gas distribution companies. Most of the public service obligations (PSOs) are linked to the duration of martial law. As we wrote in Issue 77, Naftogaz estimated its net losses in 2022 at Hr 40 billion ($966 million). Chernyshov then blamed significant receivables that arose due to the state&#x2019;s use of Naftogaz&#x2019;s working capital to meet the needs of energy consumers. He said that the company&#x2019;s underlying receivables had three components: the difference in tariffs (Hr 36 billion, or $869 million), the debt of regional gas suppliers and gas distribution companies (Hr 76 billion, or $1.8 million), and PSOs for 2022-2023 (Hr 158 billion, or $3.8 billion).&#x202F;See our Issue 77 for more detail. In December 2023, EP wrote that, according to USAID, the total level of unsettled debts in the gas market exceeded Hr 190 billion ($4.6 billion) in early September 2023 (see our Issue 113). According to the data of the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC) seen by EP, the total debt exceeded Hr 200 billion ($4.8 billion) as of Oct. 1, 2023. &#x201C;Our goal is to gradually move to economically justified energy tariffs and cancel all PSOs by the fourth quarter of 2025. This should be done in conjunction with the systematic settlement of debts in the gas and district heating markets,&#x201D; Oleksandr Butenko, then deputy minister of communities, territories and infrastructure, explained. See Issue 113 for more detail. However, Naftogaz has recently kept the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. As before, customers can buy a cubic meter of gas for Hr 7.96 including VAT ($0.19). The tariff remains valid through April 30,2025. See Issue 129 for more detail. Further gas supplies at a reduced tariff will likely result in corresponding losses for Naftogaz, even if heat and power producers pay for gas. The Rada adopts a law on privatization of state-owned banks. On Sept. 19, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Draft Law No. 11474 on the peculiarities of the sale of state-owned stakes in the authorized capital of banks. According to liga.net, one of the key provisions of the law, which was a requirement of the World Bank, is to allow the sale of any state stake in the bank, not just 100% of the shares, as provided for by the current legislation. The decision to prepare the bank&#x2019;s stake for sale would be made by the Cabinet of Ministers, taking into account the opinion of the Financial Stability Council. It would also be up to the Cabinet to decide whether to put the stake up for sale after all the necessary preparations are completed, the media also explained. If the auction is held in Ukraine, the shares would be sold on Prozorro.Sale. If the auction is held abroad, the method of bidding will depend on the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision, taking into account the recommendations of the sales advisor. According to liga.net, this law applies to five state-owned banks &#x2014; PrivatBank, Ukrgasbank, Sense Bank, PIN Bank, and Motor-Bank &#x2014; but not to Oschadbank and Ukreximbank. Sense Bank, PIN Bank, and Motor-Bank were nationalized after the beginning of the full-scale war in 2022. See our Issues 98, 116, and 138 for more detail. PrivatBank and Ukrgasbank had been nationalized earlier. Oschadbank and Ukreximbank have been state-owned since establishment. According to the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the state&#x2019;s share in the banking sector exceeds 50%, although NBU&#x2019;s First Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova said that &#x201C;more than 25% is already too much.&quot; As we wrote in January 2024 (Issue 116), foreign investors were interested in buying Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. As we reported in June 2024 (Issue 138), according to the updated IMF Memorandum, the Cabinet of Ministers was preparing to sell two systemic state-owned banks, Sense Bank and Ukrgasbank, and planned to appoint an internationally recognised financial adviser by end-September 2024. On Sept. 10, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that privatization was planned for Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank, but also said that it was difficult to say when this would happen. Shmyhal added that the Cabinet was not currently considering the privatization of Oschadbank or Ukreximbank, and there was no strategy for their sale. In 2017, two members of the SOE Weekly team, Andriy Boytsun and Dmytro Yablonovskyi, published a policy paper titled &#x201C;What Should the State Do with its Banks?&#x201D; They concluded that the risks of state ownership of banks in Ukraine outweighed the benefits, suggesting that all state-owned banks should be privatized. The state can obtain the same services from private banks or international development finance institutions. According to the State-Owned Banks Reform Strategy that the government adopted in 2020, the state intended to privatise all state-owned banks. Rada aims to increase the income tax for banks to 50% retroactively for a second year in a row. On Sept. 17, the Verkhovna Rada passed Draft Law No. 11416-d on tax increases in the first reading to finance the needs of the state budget. According to Forbes Ukraine, compared to the version approved by the Rada&#x2019;s Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy at its meeting on Aug. 29, the Rada added a provision to increase the income tax for banks from 25% to 50% in 2024. This could generate Hr 27.3 billion ($661 million) in state budget revenues in 2024 and Hr 9.3 billion ($225 million) in 2025. This idea was not supported by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Deputy Minister of Finance Svitlana Vorobey expressed fears that banks would not increase their holdings of government bonds in this case, while, according to the ministry&#x2019;s calculations, the bonds are expected to bring in more than Hr 200 billion ($4.8 billion) in additional revenues by the end of 2024. However, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak, later the ministry did agree to increased taxes for banks. Since the law would not be adopted as a whole by October 2024, the implementation would be retroactive to Oct. 1, Zheleznyak added. At the same time, the NBU considers an increase in banks&#x2019; profit tax to 50% too risky. &#x201C;The risks of such a step to solve the problem of financing the deficit and stable credit growth would be greater than the benefits. The balance is quite fragile and needs to be maintained,&#x201D; NBU Governor Andriy Pyshnyi said. On Sept. 17, Pyshnyi announced that the NBU would develop a package of measures to ensure that banks expand their coverage of the state budget deficit via the purchase of government bonds, and without the NBU issuing new money. Later, in his interview with Forbes Ukraine, Pyshnyi explained that the NBU and the Finance Ministry were developing individual strategies for banks to raise domestic government bonds to finance budget needs. He expects the biggest contribution from state-owned banks. Pyshnyi also expects that the NBU would have a constructive discussion with lawmakers on this draft law before the second reading. According to NBU&#x2019;s First Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova, if banks&#x2019; incomes are retroactively taxed at 50% (instead of 25%), two state-owned banks, Ukreximbank and Sense Bank, would be in violation of their capital requirements. This would require an additional capitalization of these banks, meaning a spending of Hr 3 billion ($72 million) from the state budget, Rozhkova emphasized. Note that this is not the first time the Rada has taken steps to raise banks&#x2019; income taxes to 50%. In 2023, parliament adopted a law increasing taxes for banks, with key changes concerning the income tax rate. That rate had been 18%, but the law introduced a windfall income tax of 50% for 2023, applied retrospectively. The income tax as from Jan. 1, 2024 was then set at 25%. See Issue 113 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 146, Ukrainian banks posted cumulative profits of Hr 120 billion ($2.9 billion) in January-July 2024, with the state-owned banks making 63% of the total. SPFU sets confiscated Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s starting price at $6.7 million. On Sept. 26, the auction commission of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) set the terms for the privatization of Motordetal-Konotop LLC, a plant confiscated earlier from sanctioned Russian senator Sergey Kalashnik. Located in Sumy Oblast, Motordetal-Konotop is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest producers of piston rings for internal combustion engines, the SPFU said. The starting price was set at Hr 278.5 million ($6.7 million at the current exchange rate). Other terms include preserving the company&#x2019;s business; repaying wage arrears, debts to the state budget, and overdue accounts payable (except for debts to sanctioned, Russian, or Belarusian individuals or legal entities); preventing personnel lay-offs for six months; and other standard terms. The SPFU did not say what amount of Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s debt was to be paid, which makes it difficult to estimate the effective amount that the prospective buyers would have to pay to acquire the asset. The privatization terms, including the starting price, are yet to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. All proceeds from this sale will go to the Fund for the Liquidation of Consequences of Armed Aggression, the SPFU added. Motordetal-Konotop was transferred to the management of the SPFU by a ruling of the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) in 2023. J seeks to confiscate Myrhorodska, Morshynska, and Alfa Insurance from Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov. On Sept. 25, the Justice Ministry reported that it filed a lawsuit with the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) to confiscate these Ukrainian assets of the sanctioned Russian oligarchs. According to the release, this concerns Myrhorod Plant of Mineral Waters (producer of Myrhorodska mineral water), Morshyn Plant of Mineral Waters Oskar (producer of Morshynska mineral water), Industrial and Distribution Systems, as well as IDS Aqua Service LLC, Potuzhnist LLC, IVA PE, and NOVA.COM SE, which are indirectly owned by Rissa Investments. According to Schemes investigative journalists, Rissa Investments Limited is 49.99% owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov. According to the ministry, Rissa is a holding company whose subsidiaries produce and distribute mineral waters, in particular, in Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. Together with Rissa, they form the Borjomi group of companies. In addition, the ministry is asking to seize 82% of the shares of Alfa Insurance and 86% of the shares of Alfa-Leasing Ukraine LLC, Paritet Finance LLC, Sense Digital LLC, and Universal Leasing Company ALFA LLC, which are indirectly owned by Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov. The lawsuit is based, in part, on the Schemes&#x2019; investigation, the media outlet noted. In May 2023, Schemes found out that the Russian company Alfa Insurance (AlfaStrakhovanie), controlled by Fridman, provides the Russian Guard with insurance services for official vehicles, including vehicles of military units directly involved in the full-scale war against Ukraine and supporting the Russian regime in the occupied territories. Investigators also found that another Fridman&#x2019;s Russian company, X5 Retail Group, continued to cooperate with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex during the full-scale war, namely with the Voyentorg enterprise of the Russian Defense Ministry, which provides the Russian military forces with uniforms and food. As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023. See more in our Issue 98. HACC seized sanctioned Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov&#x2019;s assets for over Hr 2 billion ($48 million), Inna Bogatykh, deputy justice minister, wrote on her Facebook page on Sept. 26. More than 165,000 metric tons of iron ore products with an estimated value of more than Hr 2 billion ($48 million) and IT company Peter-Service Ukraine, previously controlled by Usmanov, were seized, she explained. The deadline for challenging the decision in an appellate court was running out. The Justice Ministry is doing its best to have the first-instance court&#x2019;s decision upheld, Bogatykh added. As we wrote in December 2022 and February 2023, the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine handed over almost 170,000 metric tons of Usmanov&#x2019;s iron ore to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA).

Ukraine hits Russian long-range radar system with US-supplied ATACMS, military says	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian Nebo-M radar system using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Oct. 3. The Nebo-M, valued at about $100 million, is designed to detect and intercept aerial threats, including ballistic missiles. Ukraine&apos;s military said the radar&apos;s destruction would open an &quot;air corridor&quot; for more effective use of Storm Shadow and Scalp-EG cruise missiles. Russia is believed to have only 10 operational Nebo-M systems remaining, though the Kyiv Independent could not verify this claim. Earlier this year, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) targeted a modernized &#xA0;Nebo-U radar system in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to an SBU source.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russian-long-range-radar-system-with-us-supplied-atacms-military-says/	2024-10-03T00:25:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/e4d11b96-e81f-4295-9055-53fb68cd56e5.jpeg
Ukraine's victory plan includes 'productive steps,' US State Department says	The United States has reviewed Ukraine&apos;s victory plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said during an Oct. 2 briefing. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the five-point plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26 and discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. &quot;The victory plan that Ukraine presented is not just a question of actions that Ukraine would take. It&#x2019;s a question of actions that other countries around the world would take as well,&quot; Miller said. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. Miller declined to provide further specifics. &quot;But we took that plan, we reviewed it, we saw a number of productive steps in it,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to engage with them (Ukraine) about it.&quot; While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports suggested the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy for defeating Russia. Following the visit, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said Washington had responded to the plan &quot;constructively.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-plan-includes-productive-steps-us-state-department-says/	2024-10-02T23:43:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2123624992.jpg
Russia launches mass drone attack on Ukraine, 15 drones downed in Kyiv	About 15 Russian drones were detected and shot down near Kyiv overnight on Oct. 3, city authorities said. The air raid alert in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital lasted 5.5 hours, with explosions reported in Kyiv and surrounding areas. Drone attacks on Kyiv have increased in recent weeks, with Russia launching several groups of drones at night, approaching from various directions and altitudes, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. &quot;The enemy launched the first groups of drones before midnight, but more and more UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were constantly added throughout the night,&quot; authorities reported on Oct. 3. &quot;Nevertheless, none of the Russian drones reached their target.&quot; Debris from downed drones fell in Kyiv&#x2019;s Desnianskyi district. No damage or injuries were reported. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-drone-attack-on-ukraine-with-around-15-downed-over-kyiv/	2024-10-02T23:35:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168150121.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 656,710 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 656,710 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 3. This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,893 tanks, 17,596 armored fighting vehicles, 25,750 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,906 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 964 air defense systems, 368 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,393 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-656-710-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-02T22:58:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2163474773.jpg
Croatian president opposes country's participation in NATO's Ukraine mission	Croatian President Zoran Milanovic has refused to approve the participation of Croatian soldiers in NATO&apos;s mission to support Ukraine, citing concerns about the conflict potentially spreading to Croatia and prioritizing the safety of his country. This decision contradicts the support package agreed upon at the July NATO summit, which included establishing the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine by partners. The aim of NSATU is to support the transformation of Ukraine&apos;s Defense and Security Forces, ensuring further integration with NATO. Milanovic&apos;s refusal has sparked criticism from Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who called it &quot;manipulation&quot; that harms Croatia&apos;s international standing. Plenkovic argued that the decision only affected the deployment of a few officers to a NATO command in Germany, and that Croatia would not become directly involved in the war. This is not the first time the two leaders have disagreed on Ukraine policies. The Croatian government, mainly aligned with Plenkovic, has strongly supported military aid to Kyiv, including the delivery of 14 Mi-8 helicopters, and Plenkovic himself has made several visits to Ukraine. In contrast, Milanovic has criticized Western sanctions on Russia and opposed the provision of arms to Ukraine, highlighting a clear divide between him and the government. Despite Croatia&#x2019;s decision, NATO has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/croatian-president-opposes-countrys-participation-in-natos-ukraine-mission/	2024-10-02T20:54:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/milanovic.jpg
Biden, Xi to hold phone discussion in coming days	A phone call is being planned between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days. This comes after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining communication between the two countries&apos; leaders. A key topic for the U.S. is China&apos;s support for Russia, particularly China&apos;s role in bolstering Russia&apos;s military capabilities. Beijing has emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Recently, a Reuters report suggested that a Chinese company is providing lethal assistance to a U.S.- sanctioned Russian firm, IEMZ Kupol, which is developing drones for use in Ukraine. Meanwhile, China is marking 75 years of Communist Party rule, with President Xi reiterating his intention to &quot;reunite&quot; Taiwan with mainland China, despite U.S. support for Taiwan&apos;s defense under the Taiwan Relations Act. Faced with daily threats, Taiwan has been ordering U.S. weapons, further soaring Washington-Beijing tensions. As soon as Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Taiwan followed Western allies in imposing sanctions on Moscow and sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Taiwan ranks forth among Indo-Pacific nations in commitments to Ukraine, after Japan, Australia, and South Korea. The Taiwanese government has provided more than $110 million in aid since February 2022. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified Russia, Iran, and China as the most significant threats to critical infrastructure and democratic institutions in the United States. A DHS report, published on October 2, highlighted concerns about potential interference in the upcoming presidential election.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-xi-to-hold-phone-discussion-in-coming-days/	2024-10-02T19:26:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1435873849.jpg
US names Russia, Iran, China as biggest threats to presidential election	Russia, Iran, and China pose the most significant threats to critical infrastructure and democratic institutions in the United States, particularly the upcoming presidential election, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a report published Oct. 2. The report comes a month after the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on Russian propaganda outlets due to alleged election interference. Hostile foreign actors may use an array of tactics to undermine electoral operations, including using generative AI to create authentic-seeming text and video to spread disinformation, the DHS report said. &quot;Russia seeks to shape electoral outcomes, undermine electoral integrity, and amplify domestic divisions, while using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,&quot; the report said. &quot;Iran, meanwhile, perceives this year&apos;s elections as particularly consequential for its own national security interests.&quot; DHS warned that Russia, Iran, and China have &quot;increasingly used generative AI to create more believable text, inauthentic synthetic audio, and video that may enhance their ability to reach U.S. audiences while hiding their origins.&quot; The U.S. is one month away from the presidential election, which sees former President Donald Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris. The campaign has been fraught with turmoil, including assassination attempts, the withdrawal of President Joe Biden, and allegations of foreign interference. Iranian operatives have been indicted for allegedly hacking emails connected to Trump&apos;s campaign. The DHS report said that U.S. intelligence &quot;is confident&quot; that Iran has attempted to access individuals tied to both parties&apos; campaigns. &#xA0; The U.S. on Sept. 4 also sanctioned high-profile propagandists including RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan and seized 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns, alleging that the outlets attempted to interfere in the upcoming election. Russia has previously been accused of using social media disinformation, bot farms, and other means to back Donald Trump against his Democratic opponents &#x2013; Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden &#x2013; during the 2016and 2020 elections. Iran and China have remained Russia&apos;s key military and economic allies since the onset of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-names-russia-iran-china-as-biggest-threats-to-presidential-election/	2024-10-02T17:01:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171254794.jpg
Ukraine wants UN nuclear watchdog to place foreign observers near all its nuclear plants	Ukraine is in talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to place foreign observers near its nuclear power plants amid reports Russia is planning to attack the infrastructure connecting the plants to the country&apos;s energy grid, an Energy Ministry official said. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Sept. 24 &#xA0;that Russia is planning to strike three power plants as it continues its broader strategy of targeting and crippling Ukraine&apos;s energy system for the third year in a row. While Zelensky did not specify which ones, the country only has three operating nuclear facilities &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. The Chornobyl plant is decommissioned, while the Zaporizhzhia plant has been under Russian occupation since 2022. Yuliia Kyian, director general for Strategic Planning and European Integration at Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Ministry reiterated while speaking at a discussion in Kyiv on Oct. 2 that Russia could target infrastructure, like substations, that are connected to plants. Placing foreign observers near all its power plants &#x2014; though not directly inside of the plants &#x2014; could help to ensure nuclear and energy stability, Kyian said during the discussion, which was on the topic of energy security organized by the DiXi Group, Eastern Circles, and Prism Ukraine. &quot;Our highest priority is to safeguard these crucial assets, and we are currently in discussions regarding IAEA missions that could assist in protecting these energy facilities. Deploying such missions would demonstrate to the world that the proper operation of these facilities is vital for nuclear safety and security,&quot; Kyian told the Kyiv Independent after the talk. &#x201C;Attacks on nuclear plants and additional infrastructure is a threat to the whole world,&#x201D; she said. While Ukraine has physical constructions protecting some of its energy facilities, Kyian noted that they are not enough to prevent damage from ballistic missiles and Ukraine lacks air defense systems to fully shield against such attacks.Nuclear power is Ukraine&#x2019;s main source of energy and damage to substations could prevent nuclear plants from feeding electricity to the grid or stop backup supplies that ensure the safety of reactors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). International observers are just one idea Ukraine has suggested to safeguard its energy sector in the lead-up to a winter that Ukrainian energy think tank DixiGroup analysts warn could entail eight-hour blackouts.Currently, Kyiv is discussing the proposal with the IAEA, the global agency for nuclear safety, although Kyian did not disclose the status of the negotiations or the IAEA&#x2019;s response. She added that Ukraine has also raised the issue with the EU.Since September 2022, the IAEA has had a mission at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian authorities still deny inspectors full access to the plant.Russia&apos;s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia plant has led to heightened nuclear safety risks, with Ukraine repeatedly accusing Moscow of using the plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives.Prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, nuclear power generated half of Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity. The occupation of the plant in Zaporizhzhia took out a quarter of Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity supply. In March 2024, Russia amped up its attacks on energy infrastructure. By May, Ukraine lost a further 9GW of generation capacity after strikes damaged thermal and hydro plants forcing the country to rely more on nuclear power.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-discussing-with-atomic-agency-to-place-missions-near-all-its-nuclear-power-plants/	2024-10-02T14:32:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1600485522.jpg
Russian guided bomb hits apartment building in Kharkiv, wounding at least 9	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Kharkiv with a KAB guided bomb the night of Oct. 2, hitting a residential building and injuring at least nine people, including a child, local authorities reported. A Russian KAB guided bomb struck a five-story apartment building between the third and fourth floors, injuring at least nine people, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. One of the victims is a three-year-old girl, he said. All residents of the building are being evacuated, and emergency workers are working at the attack site. &#xA0; The strike also caused a fire at the building that spread to nearby vehicles. At least 10 vehicles were in flames following the attack. The full consequences of the attack are currently being investigated. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the bombing on his official Telegram channel, posting a video of the damaged building and calling on world leaders to help Ukraine prevent such attacks. &quot;For such Russian strikes to stop, Ukraine must receive the necessary and, most importantly, sufficient assistance from the world and its partners,&quot; he said. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-guided-bomb-hits-high-rise-in-kharkiv-wounding-at-least-8/	2024-10-02T13:39:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kharkiv-1.png
Russian proxies in occupied Kherson Oblast announce forced conscription of Ukrainians	Ukrainian men in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast will be subject to conscription into the Russian army from now until the end of the year, according to Volodymyr Saldo, Russia&apos;s proxy leader in the occupied region. Men aged 18 to 30 will be subject to conscription for a period of 12 months. Russia carried out a similar round of forced conscription in fall of 2023, drafting Ukrainians in the illegally occupied areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts along with Russian citizens. The conscription round began on Oct. 1 and will last until Dec. 31, 2024, Saldo said. Conscripts from occupied Kherson Oblast will be called to serve in Russia&apos;s Southern Military District, which includes illegally annexed Ukrainian territories. New conscripts will not be sent to front-line areas or directly involved in the full-scale invasion, Saldo claimed. In response to Saldo&apos;s announcement, Yurii Sobolevsky, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council, advised Ukrainians living under occupation to flee to E.U. countries or other safe regions. &quot;It was clear that sooner or later the enemy would use our human resources to make our people participate in this war,&quot; Soboloevsky said in a comment to Suspilne. Forced conscription under occupation constitutes a war crime under international law. Russia has reportedly conscripted tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens in the occupied parts of Ukraine to fight against their own country since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Many of them are believed to have been killed in action, as Moscow reportedly uses these people as cannon fodder to expose Ukrainian artillery positions and to cover units recruited inside Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-proxies-in-occupied-kherson-oblast-announce-forced-conscription-of-ukrainians/	2024-10-02T12:56:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1245743135.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian forces withdraw from Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Oct. 2: Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the Khortytsia group of forces said on Oct. 2. &quot;The higher command authorized a maneuver to withdraw units from Vuhledar in order to save personnel and military equipment, and take up a position for further operations,&quot; it said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years. Russian forces have been attempting to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Vuhledar withstood numerous attacks in recent weeks as Russian forces attempted to encircle the town. Local authorities confirmed that Russian troops entered Vuhledar on Oct. 1, adding that fighting was ongoing. Russia tried to capture the town &quot;at any cost&quot; by sending reserves to attack its flanks, which exhausted defending Ukrainian units, the military said. &quot;As a result of the enemy&apos;s actions there was a threat of the town being encircled,&quot; the statement added. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent last month. Vuhledar was also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward. Ukraine is planning to increase its production of drones, long-range and ballistic missiles in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the program had &quot;good dynamics.&quot; He then announced in August that Ukraine had carried out a successful test of its first domestically-made ballistic missile. According to Umerov, $4 billion has been already invested in the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. &quot;Next year we plan to increase funding. Our priority is to develop domestic drones and long-range weapons, including ballistic missiles,&quot; the minister added. Speaking at the Forum, Umerov said that Kyiv also wants to unveil more details about a major Ukrainian missile program later this year or in 2025, Interfax-Ukraine reported. In addition, the defense ministry aims to attract foreign partners to create joint ventures to develop the defense industry. &quot;An important part of this cooperation is the signing of long-term contracts for the production, supply, and maintenance of weapons to ensure that the Ukrainian army is supplied for the long term,&quot; a statement from the ministry read. Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. Russia has already abducted more than 20,000 children since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lubinets said. Less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Deported children have their personal data changed so that their relatives cannot find and bring them back home, the ombudsman added. &quot;Our children are even sent to so-called &apos;re-education camps&apos; where they are zombified with Russian propaganda. Just imagine: our children are forced to deny their Ukrainian origin,&quot; Lubinets said. Kyiv also recorded cases of children being illegally adopted by Russian families. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The unlawful transfer or deportation of civilians to Russia violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitutes a war crime under international law. At least 589 Ukrainian civilians were killed and another 2,685 injured in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to a report by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published on Oct. 1. The number of victims in the summer increased by 45% compared to the OHCHR&apos;s spring monitoring, the report reads. Over the summer, 324 men, 238 women, 14 girls, and 13 boys were killed, while 1,353 men, 1,155 women, 104 boys, and 73 girls were injured. The month of July 2024 was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since October 2022, according to the OHCHR. The OHCHR said the main cause of the high number of civilian casualties in July was a large-scale coordinated attack of dozens of missiles launched by Russia at targets across Ukraine on July 8, which killed 44 people and injured 196, as Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. The Russian army&apos;s efforts to establish control over the territory of the eastern Donetsk Oblast also resulted in many civilian casualties, the OHCHR added. At least 10,582 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 have been injured since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said on Feb. 22. The figure of 10,582, which includes 587 children, consists of civilian deaths verified according to UN methodology. The number of dead and injured in fighting immediately after the outbreak of the full-scale war has yet to be fully accounted for, and some of the places that saw the heaviest combat in early 2022 are still under Russian occupation, making it impossible for outside observers to investigate. NATO lacks adequate air defenses, military mobility, ammunition, and the mindset to be fully ready for a potential large-scale conventional war, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said on Oct. 2. Speaking at a discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Hodges said that many of Europe&apos;s political and military leaders do not fully acknowledge the realities of a possible war with Russia. Warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with many observers pointing out insufficient defense-industrial base and battle readiness on the West&apos;s part. &quot;We don&apos;t have adequate missile and air defense to protect our seaports, airports, and critical infrastructure,&quot; Hodges said. NATO&apos;s eastern flank has only 5% of the air defense capabilities necessary to deter an attack, the Financial Times reported in May. &quot;We still... cannot move quickly throughout Europe, so the issue of military mobility is still a challenge that needs to be resolved,&quot; the retired general added. If Russia decided to attack NATO, its forces would immediately strike European transport infrastructure that the allies need to respond, according to Hodges. &quot;So imagine a week of what&apos;s happening in Ukraine to happen in Gdansk, or Klaipeda, or Tallinn, or Bremerhaven,&quot; he went on. In the worst-case scenario, Lithuania would have to wait for two weeks for the arrival of reinforcements, he added. Echoing the words of his co-speaker, Romanian Defense Ministry State Secretary Simona Cojocaru, Hodges said that NATO militaries must be ready to roll out much faster than they currently can. According to the retired general, Western armies were ready for deployment within 24 hours during the Cold War, while today&apos;s militaries largely lack this mindset. NATO should have the &quot;courage to acknowledge what you see as a threat, and then start pulling ammunition out of bunkers, starting deploying troops to be prepared.&quot; Hodges added that allied leaders are often hesitant to respond fast and decisively enough, fearing such steps would be perceived as provocation. Hodges also called for investing in exercises and ammunition production to increase the alliance&apos;s military readiness. &quot;Ten and half years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and we still cannot provide enough ammunition for a week. And we&apos;ve emptied our bunkers to help.&quot; The retired general nevertheless added that European countries are &quot;moving in a much better direction,&quot; namely praising Poland&apos;s planned military transformation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-oct-2-2/	2024-10-02T12:24:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1785368869.jpg
Ukraine's military intelligence hacks Russian finance industry, source says	Cyber specialists of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) carried out a cyberattack on online platforms of the Russian financial industry on Oct. 2, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. Russian banks Alfa-Bank and Otkritie Bank, as well as Rostelecom, Russia&apos;s largest provider of digital services, were targeted, the source said, adding that these firms &quot;ensured the aggression of the Russian Armed Forces against Ukraine.&quot; The attack caused a &quot;global failure&quot; in the rapid payment system, shutting down banks&apos; mobile applications and online banking systems as well as the financial institutions&apos; internal services, according to the source. Ukrainian hackers have been attacking Russian online platforms on a regular basis since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. A previous cyberattack on Russian banks was carried out on Sept. 14, targeting Bank Rossiya, Tinkoff Bank, Gaz Bank, and the Quick Payment System (SBP) from Russia&apos;s Central Bank. Between Sept. 23 and 26, cyber specialists of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence attacked over 800 servers in various regions of Russia. In late August, Ukrainian hackers attacked the servers of Russian internet providers and blocked &quot;dozens&quot; of online platforms at industrial facilities in Russia. The attack affected at least 33 servers and 283 office computers at industrial facilities, took down 21 websites, and destroyed 15 cloud and file storage systems. A large-scale cyberattack in late June left at least 250,000 consumers in occupied Crimea and other Russian-controlled territories without communication. The June attack reportedly affected both the networks of consumers and operators that used the impacted infrastructure in Russian-occupied territories. Representatives of Russian providers called it &quot;the most powerful DDoS attack they have ever experienced,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-attacks-russian-financial-industrys-online-network-source-says/	2024-10-02T12:13:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2076721343.jpg
Putin signs law allowing criminal defendants to join the military	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on Oct. 2 that exempts defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army, according to Russia&apos;s legal information portal. The Russian government wants to conscript 40% of the nearly 60,000 prisoners who are currently held in pre-trial detention centers, according to the independent Russian news outlet IStories. A source told Istories that about 100 people from each Russian detention center are planned to be sent to the war in Ukraine. There are currently 210 pre-trial detention centers in Russia, so about 20,000 people may be sent to serve, the media outlet said. The law allows military service for defendants whose cases are pending in a court of first instance during mobilization or wartime. Another law signed by Putin allows for the release from criminal liability of defendants who have previously been mobilized or who have signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry. According to the newly adopted legislation, criminal proceedings against these people will be suspended, and the preventive measure will be canceled during military service. A similar procedure applies to convicts whose sentences have been issued but not yet finalized, including during an appeal process in a criminal case. The defendants will be fully exempt from criminal liability after receiving a state award or dismissal from military service due to age, health condition, or the end of mobilization. Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war against Ukraine since summer 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner mercenary company and then directly under the Russian Defense Ministry. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that Russia is likely recruiting a total of around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regular fall conscription campaign. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-signs-law-allowing-criminal-defendants-to-join-the-military/	2024-10-02T11:54:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg
USAID provides $237 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, launches Rehab4U initiative	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has launched the Rehab4U project to help Ukrainians rehabilitate after the war and has allocated an additional $237 million for humanitarian aid to Ukraine with the support of the U.S. State Department. The announcement came on Oct. 2 as USAID chief Samantha Power arrived in Kyiv, marking her third visit to Ukraine since 2020. The $13 million initiative Rehab4U aims to increase access to services and assistive technology and promote the inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in the communities and the country&apos;s recovery, the USAID statement reads. The project will be implemented across 15 regions in Ukraine to ensure &quot;a nationwide impact.&quot; The additional $237 million in aid is intended to help partners &quot;provide life-saving assistance, including critical winterization preparedness aid ahead of the harsh winter months,&quot; according to USAID. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter due to Russia&apos;s attacks targeting the country&apos;s energy infrastructure, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Ukrainian cities were already experiencing extended blackouts. The agency said that the allocated assistance also aims to support U.N. partners and non-governmental organizations in providing medical services to the local population, housing and its repair, and restoration of heating and water supply systems, among other needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/usaid-provides-237-million-in-humanitarian-aid-to-ukraine-launches-rehab4u-initiative/	2024-10-02T11:27:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1702431868.jpg
‘Human safari’: Kherson civilians hunted down by Russian drones	Editor&#x2019;s note: Some of the Kherson locals interviewed for this story refused to be identified by last name due to fear for their safety. KHERSON &#x2013; On a warm September evening, Olha Chernyshova&#x2019;s day took a grim turn when she was returning home from work in downtown Kherson. Stepping out of her car, she heard a loud buzz and immediately knew it was not a bumblebee. She rushed towards her home&#x2019;s entrance door. A deafening blast shook the yard. A drone had dropped an explosive on her car. Time froze. Back in the yard, Chernyshova saw shattered glass, plastic, and a small metallic cylinder. Her heart racing, she called the police. A team of sappers soon retrieved an undetonated part of a fragmentation grenade. That same day, other drones targeted nearby cars, injuring three of Chernyshova&#x2019;s neighbors. A week after the terrifying incident, she spoke to the Kyiv Independent near her home, hiding from another drone under a large chestnut tree. &#x201C;Where will we hide once the leaves are gone?&#x201D; she asked. &#x201C;It will be an open season on people. I need to work on more drone safety measures.&#x201D; Kherson resident Olha Chernyshova cleans shattered glass from her car after a Russian drone attack in Kherson, Ukraine, in September 2024. (Zarina Zabrisky/The Kyiv Independent)Russian soldiers use kamikaze drones, typically so-called FPV (first-person view) commercial drones loaded with grenades or other explosives to &quot;hunt&quot; civilians in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. (Facebook)Owner of a family grocery store in Kherson, the capital of Ukraine&#x2019;s southern region on the Dnipro River, Chernyshova lives in a city that has endured relentless Russian artillery and air strikes since its liberation from occupation in the fall of 2022. Local residents last year endured a massive flood triggered by Russia&#x2019;s blowing up of the Kakhovka dam just north of the city. Now, like other residents, she finds herself dodging Russian kamikaze drone strikes, typically so-called FPV (first-person view) commercial drones loaded with grenades or other explosives. Their use along the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion to kill infantry and tanks alike has been widespread, changing the future of warfare. But in the ravaged city of Kherson, where Ukraine-controlled territory and Russian forces are separated by the Dnipro River instead of no man&#x2019;s land between trenches in the eastern Donbas region, civilians are being targeted routinely. Terrified locals refer to the new strategy as &#x201C;a human safari.&#x201D; &#x201C;Drones are now flying in groups and attacking everything that moves,&#x201D; said Serhii, a volunteer-turned-taxi driver. &#xA0;&#x201C;Our charity hub had to close because trucks can no longer deliver humanitarian aid. This has not only cut off critical supplies but also crippled local businesses that rely on transportation. It&#x2019;s scary to think what will happen in winter when food and fuel shortages could escalate into a full-blown crisis.&#x201D; As drone attacks intensified, Chernyshova &#x2014; a business owner and mother dedicated to safety &#x2014; was authorized by the Kherson administration to initiate the development of drone security guidelines for the city. Online public information resource Dovidka.info wrote and designed posters based on her recommendations for Kherson and other front-line zones. &#x201C;Drones are a real pain for Kherson. Everyone is a target,&#x201D; said Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson Oblast Military Administration. &#x201C;Under attack are people walking, driving, bicycling, going to work or standing by grocery stores.&#x201D; Drone strikes averaged 100 per day in July and August 2024, he said. But as autumn set in, the numbers have spiked dramatically. Ukraine&#x2019;s TSN news program reported that a record high of 330 drone strikes and 224 explosive drops hit the region on Sept. 9 alone. To attack women buying watermelons at city corners and children playing in parks, Russian forces use modified commercial drones. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video showing a Russian FPV drone loaded with grenade or other explosive &quot;hunting&quot; a civilian in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. (Provided by the author)&#x201C;First, you see a reconnaissance drone like a Mavic,&#x201D; said Svitlana, a doctor living by the river. &#x201C;You can hardly hear it, and it just looks around, sending video to the Russian pilot across the river,&#x201D; she said, referring to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to the south where Russian forces still control swatches of Kherson Oblast. &#x201C;Then comes an FPV (first-person view) drone, dropping a grenade on you. Or, a Coca-Cola can with explosives. Sometimes, the drone crashes and blows up. A 90-year-old woman was badly injured next door, in her yard,&#x201D; she added. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams respond to drone attacks in Kherson every day. &#x201C;Often, as I drive to the location, drones chase my car: they do &#x2018;double taps,&#x2019; striking first responders and sappers,&#x201D; a leading expert in the field told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity citing lack of authority to speak with the media. &#x201C;I fire at them with an AK rifle, but it&#x2019;s difficult because the drones are small and fly at an altitude of 120 meters. Any lower than 30 meters means the drone is in attack mode, so I hide and wait. Once it&#x2019;s gone, I can neutralize an FPV drone or explosives if it hasn&apos;t detonated. If it did, I look through debris and, often, human body parts to figure out the kind of drone and explosives used.&#x201D; The sapper shared a Telegram channel where Russian drone operators post videos of these attacks. &#x201C;They know that the international laws prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians, civilian infrastructure, and humanitarian missions but they believe the anonymity protects them from prosecution,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They also need to show the results of their work. Russian volunteers fundraise for Mavic and FPV drones because these commercial models lack military certification and aren&#x2019;t supplied by the military.&#x201D; Volodymyr, a former construction business owner, got two concussions as drones dropped explosives on his car four times. He lives in a large house within walking distance of the Dnipro River. He lost his company during the nine months of Russian occupation and survived two years of shelling, bombing, missile attacks, and the Kakhovka dam flood. After two recent artillery attacks, his family left Kherson. L: A part of a Russian drone in an undated photo in Kherson Oblast. (Provided by the author) R: An information poster for civilians on how to protect themselves against Russian drone strikes targeting civilians. (Provided by the author)From his window, Volodymyr can see the Dnipro River that divides Ukrainian-controlled territory from the Russian-occupied left bank. &#x201C;The river is only 800 meters wide here, and a sniper used to shoot at me from the bushes. When our guys pushed the Russians back last fall, they tried to wipe us out with aerial guided bombs but those were too expensive. So now it&#x2019;s all drones,&#x201D; Volodymyr told the Kyiv Independent. Volodymyr helps a group of volunteers, drone enthusiasts, and local engineers work together to develop anti-drone technologies and assist the Ukrainian military in countering drone attacks. Another group member, Oleksandr, an engineer and local drone manufacturer involved in the community&#x2019;s efforts, told the Kyiv Independent that Russian drones can now fly and strike further due to new technology. They are equipped with retransmitters &#x2014; devices that boost, extend, and share signals between reconnaissance and attack drones. According to Oleksandr, drones have likely become the weapon of choice due to effective Ukrainian artillery strikes on Russian positions and ammunition depots, potentially causing a shell shortage. This, combined with some Russian troops being redeployed to the Kharkiv and Kursk fronts, has led to a reliance on drones. &#x201C;Our Ukrainian military has intercepted Russian phone conversations,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It seems that graduates of Russian drone pilot schools practice on us, using any moving target for training. They kill and injure civilians every day.&#x201D; Angela, a resident of the Shidnyi district, often visits her parents in Antonivka, a town just north of Kherson. There, the main bridge &#x2014; that once connected both sides of the river &#x2013; now stands heavily damaged from years of strikes. Antonivka also faces heavy drone attacks. As Angela waits at a bus stop, drones hover over the street and her heart sinks. She lost Serhii, her husband of 32 years, in early August when shrapnel from a grenade dropped by a drone pierced his heart. By the time she rushed home from work, Serhii had died. She still lives in their apartment, with drones buzzing by her window daily. With her elderly parents and in-laws still in Kherson Oblast, moving is off the table, due to the financial strain and the logistics. Close to Angela&#x2019;s home is the Regional Oncological Health Center. The street in front of it resembles a war movie set, with a minivan abandoned in the middle of the road, its windows broken and doors flung open. A bomb shelter on the corner shows skid marks from an FPV drone that crashed into it. &#x201C;Drones attack our buildings, ambulances, and cars daily. They kill our doctors and patients,&#x201D; said Iryna Sokur, the oncological hospital director. &#x201C;They also target our generators, putting about 100 patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery at risk.&#x201D; The destroyed building after a Russian drone attack on Zolota Balka village in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kherson Oblast State Administration/Telegram)The destroyed building after a Russian drone attack on Zolota Balka village in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kherson Oblast State Administration/Telegram)Sadove, another suburb of Kherson, already devasted by incessant artillery attacks, began facing drone attacks in early 2024. By August, residents suffered from ten drone strikes daily, said Natalia, a volunteer. &#x201C;One drone destroyed our cell phone tower, so we couldn&#x2019;t call firefighters,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;The water wells failed because the drones destroyed the diesel generators for pumping water. When the drones dropped napalm on roofs and dried-up lawns, firefighters could not respond due to &#x2018;double taps.&#x2019;&#x201D; As fires destroyed more and more houses in Sadove, most residents were forced to leave even though the evacuation from areas like Antonivka and Sadove diminished or stopped as highways were targeted. &#x201C;Everywhere in Kherson, drones drop napalm-filled improvised incendiary devices that explode on impact, causing fires that spread rapidly,&#x201D; said Volodymyr Perepelytsia, head of explosive services for the National Police in Kherson Oblast. &#x201C;They also drop banned PFM-1 anti-personnel mines that look like fallen leaves in parks and streets. If you step on them, you lose a limb.&#x201D; &#xA0; Until June, the coastal areas of Kherson were targeted the most. By September, drones easily reached downtown. Ukrainian forces and local authorities are implementing countermeasures against drone attacks. In September 2024, city officials allocated Hr 8 million ($195,000) to enhance defenses. Since the beginning of the year, over 200 electronic warfare systems have been delivered to troops in Kherson Oblast to strengthen their ability to combat Russian drones. However, the Russian military continually changes frequencies to evade detection by radar and air defense systems, making it challenging for Ukrainian electronic warfare systems to intercept and neutralize them. Russian drone attacks are likely designed to demoralize Ukrainians, leading to two key outcomes: mass evacuations that create &quot;gray zones&quot; along the Dnipro River and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enter peace talks with the Kremlin. Since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, Kherson&apos;s population has plummeted from about 280,000 to 60,000, with an additional 50 settlements added to the mandatory evacuation order by August 2024. The human toll in Kherson is also mounting. Nearly half of the 547 casualties reported from July 1 to Sept. 9, 2024, were caused by drones, according to a representative from the Kherson military administration who spoke on condition of anonymity citing lack of authority to be interviewed by media. Yet, despite daily attacks, the remaining Kherson residents fix windows with plywood and go on with their lives. &#x201C;Life goes on. At my art studio, we have decided to celebrate the forthcoming Kherson City Day with watermelons this Saturday,&#x201D; said Olena, a medical worker. On Kherson City Day, however, Olena waited for two hours as the drones were hovering over her high rise &#x2013; they never left and she never made it to the party.	https://kyivindependent.com/human-safari-kherson-civilians-hunted-down-by-russian-drones/	2024-10-02T10:07:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-02-at-18_54_06.png
589 civilians killed in Ukraine in summer 2024 by Russia's war, UN reports	At least 589 Ukrainian civilians were killed and another 2,685 injured in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to a report by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published on Oct. 1. The number of victims in the summer increased by 45% compared to the OHCHR&apos;s spring monitoring, the report reads. Over the summer, 324 men, 238 women, 14 girls, and 13 boys were killed, while 1,353 men, 1,155 women, 104 boys, and 73 girls were injured. The month of July 2024 was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since October 2022, according to the OHCHR. The OHCHR said the main cause of the high number of civilian casualties in July was a large-scale coordinated attack of dozens of missiles launched by Russia at targets across Ukraine on July 8, which killed 44 people and injured 196, as Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported.

Ukrainian Armor to produce 155mm shells using Czechoslovak Group's technology, components	Ukrainian Armor, a private defense enterprise, signed two deals on Oct. 2 with the Czech holding Czechoslovak Group (CSG) to cooperate on the production of 155mm shells, Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported from the DFNC2: International Defense Industries Forum. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has made a wide-reaching shift to NATO standard 155 mm artillery, as Kyiv&apos;s partners had a short supply in stock of Soviet-caliber shells &#x2013; 122 mm and 152 mm. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. The CSG will supply components and share the technology and manufacturing documentation for the production of the shells to Ukrainian Armor, according to the media outlet. The licensing process will be finalized by the end of the year. And the production is expected to start in early 2025. &quot;We plan to produce and supply about 100,000 rounds of ammunition next year and more than 300,000 in 2026. The process of equipment preparation has already begun,&quot; Ukrainian Armor&apos;s CEO Vladyslav Belbas said. Ammunition will be manufactured in both Ukraine and the Czech Republic, which will increase its production and reduce the costs, Belbas added. The contract includes the production of three types of 155 mm artillery shells. The companies also plan to produce other types of shells and other defense products, such as spare parts for armored vehicles, Militarnyi said. In early March, Bloomberg and Reuters reported that CSG plans to invest &quot;hundreds of millions of euros&quot; in Ukraine to boost its supply of ammunition and equipment. CSG was in talks with state-owned enterprise Ukrainian Defense Industry (UkrOboronProm) on a potential joint venture, billionaire owner Michal Strnad told journalists on March 6. The company has sent around 150 pieces of equipment to Ukraine, funded by other EU or NATO countries, since the start of the full-scale invasion, Strnad told reporters. CSG already produces ammunition, Tatra trucks, and armored vehicles, as well as modernizes Soviet T72 tanks for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-armor-to-produce-155mm-shells-using-czechoslovak-groups-technology-components/	2024-10-02T08:13:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
1.5 million Ukrainian children at risk of being deported to Russia, ombudsman says	Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. Russia has already abducted more than 20,000 children since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lubinets said. Less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Deported children have their personal data changed so that their relatives cannot find and bring them back home, the ombudsman added. &quot;Our children are even sent to so-called &apos;re-education camps&apos; where they are zombified with Russian propaganda. Just imagine: our children are forced to deny their Ukrainian origin,&quot; Lubinets said. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s Office, those from children&apos;s homes in Kherson Oblast were first moved to the occupied territories and then deported to Russia. Kyiv also recorded cases of children being illegally adopted by Russian families. &quot;Russia deliberately slows down the process of returning our children,&quot; Lubinets said. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The unlawful transfer or deportation of civilians to Russia violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitutes a war crime under international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-5-million-ukrainian-children-at-risk-of-being-deported-by-russia-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-02T06:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
US company AeroVironment plans to start producing Switchblade loitering munitions in Ukraine	The U.S.-based AeroVironment signed an agreement with a Ukrainian company to localize its production of Switchblade 600 loitering munitions, marking the latest of several recent agreements between Ukrainian and foreign companies to produce weaponry in Ukraine. The Ukrainian company is not being named because of security reasons. The agreement was signed on Oct. 1 during the DFNC2 International Defense Industries Forum in Kyiv, where nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries attended. The Switchblade 600 is a loitering munition used to strike targets by crashing into them. They have a flight range of 40 kilometers or more, and can stay in the air for over 40 minutes. Brett Hush, a senior vice president at AeroVironments who signed the agreement in Kyiv, praised the Switchblade&apos;s performance and added, &quot;with the support and feedback from Ukraine, it&apos;ll be even better.&quot; The Switchblade 600 has been included as part of U.S. assistance packages to Ukraine since 2022. The agreement was one of several signed at the forum to increase joint production between Ukrainian and foreign companies as Ukraine builds its defense capabilities two and a half years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Prague-based Czechoslovak Group signed an agreement for production of several types of heavy artillery ammunition, including 155 shells. The agreement envisions production to start early next year after the required licenses are obtained. &quot;Since the war started, we were able to bring here more than one million pieces of heavy artillery ammunition, and I&apos;m more than sure that thanks to this effort which we recently started, we will be able to double our production capabilities,&quot; said CSG&apos;s Richard Kubena who signed the agreement at the event. U.S.-based D&amp;M Holding Company signed an agreement for joint production of ammunition and specialty chemicals, and Poland&apos;s METALEXPORT signed an agreement for joint production of a strike drone. Also at the forum, French-German defense company KNDS announced it opened an office in Kyiv and plans to produce artillery ammunition in the country. These agreements follow a string of joint production announcements between Ukraine and foreign companies. Among them are German&apos;s defense giant Rheinmetall, Estonia&apos;s Frankenburg Technologies, and Sweden&apos;s Saab. At the forum, President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted that Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said. According to the president, Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones per year and has already contracted 1.5 million. The country is also producing between 15-20 Bohdana howitzers per month.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-company-aerovironment-plans-to-start-producing-switchblade-loitering-munitions-in-ukraine/	2024-10-02T05:47:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DFNC2-Panel-Photo.jpg
Number of Ukrainians willing to join Ukrainian Legion in Poland 'too small,' minister says	The number of Ukrainians willing to join the Ukrainian Legion in Poland has been &quot;too small,&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told Wirtualna Polska on Oct. 2. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. &quot;We are not responsible for recruitment, but the number of people who were supposed to come forward from the Ukrainian side is too small,&quot; the Polish minister said. &quot;Declarations at the beginning were very high, that even one brigade could be formed... several thousand people. However, this did not happen.&quot; The legion was announced as part of the security agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on July 8. Recruitment for the Ukrainian Legion was planned to be conducted by Ukrainian consular offices. The volunteers were expected to be conscripted under Ukraine&apos;s legislation and trained in Poland by the country&apos;s military. &quot;Several thousand&quot; people registered to participate in the legion as of July 11, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said previously. According to Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland has trained about 20,000 Ukrainian military personnel who are now fighting at the frontline in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/number-of-ukrainians-willing-to-join-ukrainian-legion-in-poland-too-small-minister-says/	2024-10-02T05:06:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153247705.jpg
Investigation: Shattering secrecy of Putin’s top spy chief	Even for a Russian spy service official, Sergey Korolev stands out as exceptionally secretive. Korolev, the second-in-command at Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB), has hidden the details of his life and identity so well that even the basics like his birth date and appearance are mixed up or appear to have been invented entirely. This secretiveness may be helping him evade international sanctions. The spy chief, whose agency plays a special role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, is identified inconsistently or incorrectly on numerous international sanctions lists, possibly rendering him at times undetectable to sanctions enforcers. Moreover, the only photo of &#x201C;Korolev&#x201D; that appears in many media reports about him pictures a completely different Russian man. The Kyiv Independent has filled in the gaps in the story of Korolev, stripping Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s second-main spy chief of a significant portion of his long-lived anonymity. The FSB, a successor to the notorious Soviet KGB service, plays a crucial role in Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s regime. The service is known to have been engaged in recruiting pro-Russian agents in other countries, sabotage, cyber operations, espionage, disinformation campaigns, and even poisoning and assassinations. The FSB was also responsible for providing Putin with intelligence prior to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to media reports. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Korolev, FSB&apos;s first deputy director and the second most influential figure in the country&apos;s main security agency, was among the Russian officials targeted by international sanctions. The EU sanctions list said Korolev&#x2019;s actions at the FSB &#x201C;threaten Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and independence.&#x201D; Spanish law enforcement also uncovered significant connections between Korolev and the Russian mafia in the first decade of the 2000s, according to media reports. Despite the high-profile role, Korolev, much like a character from a spy novel, is one of the most mysterious individuals in Russia&#x2019;s special service leadership. His name helps the secrecy. He bears one of the most popular Russian names and a fairly common last name. He is a namesake of the famous Sergey Korolev, the scientist behind the Soviet Union&#x2019;s space race success. Like everyone in Russia, Korolev bears a patronymic. His full name is Sergey Borisovich Korolev. That doesn&#x2019;t help much to pin his true identity down: According to two leaked databases of Russian individuals&#x2019; data, he has nearly two dozen full namesakes in Russia. Moreover, a puzzling error was made in Korolev&#x2019;s identifying information in European sanctions lists. The European Union&#x2019;s and Swiss sanctions lists contain two different dates of his birth &#x2014; both of which seem to be incorrect. It doesn&#x2019;t help that his Russian name has variations of English transliteration: It can be Korolyov or Korolev, and Sergey or Sergei. Official sources use different versions, potentially complicating his identification. (Editor&#x2019;s Note: Throughout this story, we identify him as Sergey Korolev, as we believe this spelling variant most likely matches his passport.) &#xA0; Korolev has never been interviewed by the media and has no known social media accounts. It seems that very few people know what the second-in-command at the FSB actually looks like. When he is mentioned in the media, the accompanying photo is that of another person, as the Kyiv Independent has been able to prove. One will not find Korolev&#x2019;s photo or date of birth on the FSB website. Only a few details from his biography are available there. Korolev was appointed to his current role by Putin in 2021. He holds the high rank of general in the Russian military and has been with Russia&apos;s security services since 1979. These scant details gave a start to our search. The single image used online as the photo for Korolev shows a young-looking man with a buzz cut, wearing a black jacket and tie, similar to the stereotypical image of a secret service officer. This photo has been used hundreds of times to accompany mentions of Korolev online. The real Korolev looks nothing like the man in the picture. However, the fake photo is so prevalent that it was even listed as Korolev&#x2019;s portrait on the website of Rosatom Corporation, a Russian state-owned nuclear holding. Korolev has been sitting on Rosatom&#x2019;s supervisory board since 2017, combining it with his role at FSB. Rosatom added the photo in 2021, when Korolev was appointed deputy head of FSB. Media reports about the appointment massively used the fake photo. It spread across the web and even got into foreign press. Incorrect image falsely used to represent Sergey Korolev of the FSB on Facebook and on a Russian official website. (The Kyiv Independent)Then, the fake photo traveled even further. After Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Agency for Corruption Prevention maintained a register of persons sanctioned by Ukraine. This public list included Korolev &#x2013; again, with the same photo showing a different person. But where did the fake photo of Korolev come from in the first place? In some articles, the image is credited to Boris Yarkov. We found him. Yarkov is a photographer, founder, and editor-in-chief of a local news agency Poviestka Dnia in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. It appears that it was Yarkov&#x2019;s news agency that gave a start to the years-long misidentification of Korolev. In July 2016, Yarkov&apos;s news agency apparently used the photo in question to illustrate the news about Korolev&apos;s appointment to the FSB&apos;s Economic Security Unit. The report didn&#x2019;t indicate that the buzz-cut man in the photo was Korolev. It&#x2019;s a frequent practice for smaller online media to use photos with an illustrative purpose, where the image doesn&#x2019;t necessarily depict the person or event mentioned in the story. Moreover, within the next year, the media outlet removed the photo from its news story. It remained on Yarkov&apos;s personal Facebook page, where we found it. In a conversation with the Kyiv Independent, the photographer Yarkov confirmed that it was not Korolev in the photo, and suggested the person was a security guard. He could not remember the circumstances of taking the photo. We have identified the man who had accidentally and unwillingly lent his appearance to a top FSB official. Image analysis software indicates that the photo most likely represents a Yekaterinburg resident, Artem Kupliennikov, who does not appear to have any connections to Korolev. We called Kupliennikov, pretending to be the communications director of Rosatom. Kuplennikov admitted that it was him in the photo of &#x201C;Korolev.&#x201D; When the photo was taken, he worked at the security service of Yeltsin Center, a cultural complex in Yekaterinburg. The center hosts many public events, and Kupliennikov believes he was photographed during one of them. Kupliennikov claims that he reached out to some media outlets saying it was him in the photo and asking to take it down &#x2014; but the photo nevertheless circulated as the photo of Sergey Korolev. As bizarre as it is, this mistake has helped the real Korolev keep his appearance private. While investigative journalists reporting on Korolev suspected that the man in the widespread photo wasn&#x2019;t him, they had no other images, and all the previous investigative journalism reports about Korolev ran without his photo. Exiled Russian investigative journalists have revealed Korolev&#x2019;s business and criminal connections, but never ran his portrait. Ukrainian intelligence sources have provided the Kyiv Independent with photos that they believe show the real Korolev. Several Ukrainian and foreign media outlets have received and published similar photos, seemingly without verification. We have investigated these images independently, and were able to confirm that the man in the photos is the real Sergey Korolev. The real Sergey Korolev shows up in several photos published on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, an inter-agency assembly headed by FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov. Most of the photos don&#x2019;t have any captions and Korolev is never mentioned in the reports about the committee meetings. But two photos provide a clue: A name sign reading &#x201C;Sergey Borisovich Korolev&#x201D; is in the frame. Sergey Korolev on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, headed by the FSB, in 2019. (The Kyiv Independent)Sergey Korolev on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, headed by the FSB, in 2017. (The Kyiv Independent)The second source to confirm Korolev&apos;s appearance was an account on the Russian social media platform Odnoklassniki (Russian for &#x201C;Classmates&#x201D;). The account is dedicated to archiving Russian border guards&#x2019; history. It appears that the account is run by a former classmate of Sergey Korolev from the FSB Border Institute &#x2014; formerly, a KGB School. The page has been active for at least five years and contains more than a thousand photographs, mostly of Russian security forces involved in the border service at various times. Korolev &#x2014; the same man seen in the photos with the FSB director &#x2014; can be spotted in many of them. Archive photo of Sergey Korolev from a Russian Odnoklassniki social media account. The photo is most likely taken in 2003. (The Kyiv Independent)Several photos show a gathering of FSB Border Institute alumni, dated June 2003, apparently taking place on the occasion of the 20-year anniversary of their graduation. Korolev is seen in two photos from the gathering: a large group photo, and a smaller photo of nine men, added to an album called &#x201C;Classmates who are now generals.&#x201D; The account published the photos long after they were taken, in 2019 and in 2023. In the comments, the account owner and alleged classmate of Korolev described the career path of the men in the photos. Korolev, he wrote, started in the border guard service and rose to head the FSB economic security department. Archive photo of Sergey Korolev from a Russian Odnoklassniki social media account. The photo is most likely taken in 2003. (The Kyiv Independent)The account also has photos of young Korolev as a cadet in the FSB Border Institute, in an album entitled &#x201C;Studies at the Border Guard School (1979-1983).&#x201D; The year matches Korolev&#x2019;s official date of joining Russia&#x2019;s security services &#x2014; as a cadet, he&#x2019;d count as a member of the force starting his first year of studies.

(The Kyiv Independent)The former classmate isn&#x2019;t the only source of Korolev&#x2019;s imagery online. For all his secretiveness, the deputy head of FSB has left some more traces. Korolev was photographed alongside former Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. During Serdyukov&#x2019;s tenure as minister, Sergey Korolev served as his adviser. Former Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov is talking at an event in 2019. Sergey Korolev is spotted attending the event. (The Kyiv Independent)At least once, Korolev did something atypical for a top spy agency official: In 2020, he showed up at the recording of a popular Russian TV comedy show, KVN. The man who was months away from being appointed deputy head of FSB sat in one of the first rows, where he would certainly be caught on camera. The filming took place in Yalta, Crimea, a Ukrainian city that has been under Russian occupation since 2014. The TV version of the show can still be found on YouTube and has over a million views, with Korolev shown throughout the recording multiple times. Perhaps Korolev was convinced that years of secretiveness granted him enough anonymity that he could attend a popular show incognito, sit in the second row, right behind the jury, be filmed from every possible angle, and shown on Russia&#x2019;s state TV. A photo report from the filming, published in a local newspaper, also captures Korolev, but doesn&#x2019;t identify him. Korolev didn&#x2019;t attend alone: It was a family outing. We identified the people around Korolev: Sitting next to him are his wife Marina, son Boris, and daughter Anastasia. We matched them with other images we found on the web. Sergey Korolev with his wife Marina, daughter Anastasia, and son Boris at a Russian televised comedy show KVN in 2020, in Russian occupied Yalta, Crimea. (Media Yalta)The mystery of the birth dateKorolev is subject to sanctions imposed by the EU, Switzerland, the U.K., Canada, the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and Ukraine as a result of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. These sanctions restrict his access to assets in these countries, limit financial operations, and, in some of them, impose a travel ban. The sanctions were imposed in 2022 and 2023. For the sanctions to work efficiently and for the authorized bodies to be able to identify the exact Sergey Korolev and his assets, his date of birth is an important detail. Up until the sanctions were imposed, there seemed to be no confusion about Korolev&#x2019;s date of birth: It was listed as July 25, 1962. This date of birth was on Wikipedia pages about Korolev, both in English and Russian, where notably, there was no photo. This is the only date of birth mentioned by Russian investigative journalists reporting on Korolev and his alleged links to Russian criminals in a story published in 2021. Thus, at the time of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Korolev, his date of birth was not a secret and was not questioned. But then, something went wrong. In 2022, the EU and Swiss sanctions lists offered two possible birth dates for Sergey Korolev, both a decade earlier than the real one: July 25, 1952 and Nov. 9, 1952. We couldn&#x2019;t find any obvious explanation for why these birth dates were listed. Equally interesting is why Korolev&apos;s publicly known date of birth wasn&apos;t included in the EU and Swiss sanctions lists even as one of the options. We were able to verify that Korolev&apos;s actual date of birth is July 25, 1962. This date is listed in his registration documents in a St. Petersburg apartment, where his daughter Anastasia is also registered, according to leaked Russian databases. This date is also mentioned in the Odnoklassniki account presumably run by Korolev&apos;s former classmate. &#x201C;Second row, second from left &#x2014; Korolev Sergey Borisovich. On July 25, 2022, Sergey celebrated his 60th birthday,&#x201D; the account owner wrote, commenting on one of the photos. The European Union and Switzerland allegedly made a mistake in Sergey Korolev&apos;s date of birth while adding him to their sanctions lists. (Karolina Gulshani / The Kyiv Independent)Several countries have also identified Korolev&apos;s date of birth as July 25, 1962 in their sanctions lists: the UK in April 2022, Australia in May 2022, Ukraine in October 2022, New Zealand in November 2022, and the US in July 2023. Canada has also listed 1962 as his year of birth without mentioning a specific date in its sanctions in March 2022. The wrong date is listed only in the EU and Swiss sanctions. The Kyiv Independent sent inquiries to the European Commission, the EU Council representatives and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), asking how the mistake occurred, what consequences it could have had, and whether any assets belonging to Korolev in the EU or Switzerland had been identified. In a written response, the EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Peter Stano said that he had &#x201C;no information about difficulties in implementing the sanctions&#x201D; against Korolev in the EU member states. &#x201C;The date of birth is only one of the identifiers,&#x201D; he said, without specifying what other identifiers in the EU sanctions list could help banks and other institutions identify the correct Sergey Korolev. He also did not explain how the incorrect birth date of 1952 got into the sanctions adopted by the EU Council, saying the Council has &#x201C;every relevant information at its disposal to identify precisely the individual or the entity to be added to the list of those subject to sanctions.&#x201D; The SECO spokesperson responded that the Swiss list of sanctions against Russia is identical to the EU list. &#x201C;Deviations are being examined,&#x201D; Francoise Tschanz, spokesperson for SECO, told the Kyiv Indepedendent, adding that SECO does not comment on individual cases. To make matters worse, Korolev and his family appear to have used fictitious names. According to the leaked Russian databases, Sergey Korolev and his family were registered at the same address in St. Petersburg with fictitious names. The surname, patronymics, dates of birth, and passport numbers were real &#x2014; which we confirmed via the Russian Tax Service database &#x2014; but the first names were altered. In the database, Sergey Korolev became Nikolai, his son Boris became Vadim, and his daughter Anastasia became Veronika. A Russian investigative journalist previously claimed Korolev&apos;s son was listed in official documents under the fake name Gennady Streltsov. Another potential obstacle for Korolev&#x2019;s identification in the sanctions list is the inconsistent transliteration of his name. &#x201C;Sergey Korolev&#x201D; is likely the spelling used in Korolev&#x2019;s passport. It&#x2019;s the only spelling that shows up in a leaked database of Russian individuals&apos; data. &#x201C;Korolev&#x201D; is also the transliteration used by the official&#x2019;s children when registering emails and social media. However, only the Australian and U.S. sanctions notices use this spelling for all parts of his name. The others spell his name as &#x201C;Sergei&#x201D; or surname as &#x201C;Korolyov.&#x201D; This spelling used to be listed as one form of his name on the U.K. sanctions, but in March 2023, it was removed. The removal was explained as eliminating a duplicate entry. As a result, only Sergei Borisovich Korolyov remains on the U.K. sanctions list. &#xA0; The EU and Swiss sanction lists went further, adding an extra letter &quot;s&#x201D; to his patronymic: Sergei Borissovich Korolev, in accordance with the French transliteration. The errors in sanctions&#x2019; lists &#x2014; the wrong birth date and wrong transliteration &#x2014; could complicate identifying Korolev as a sanctioned FSB official for border authorities, banks, and other institutions. &#x201C;This leaves wiggle room. The sanction remains, but some banks, for example, might not recognize this person as sanctioned, especially if there is no other identifying data,&#x201D; explains Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine&#x2019;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy. This means that the FSB&apos;s first deputy director may have been able to circumvent restrictions in some European countries. Why did European sanctions lists include incorrect birth dates for a high-ranking FSB official? On the one hand, the scarce information about one of the FSB&apos;s leaders raises the possibility of human error in identifying this non-public figure by foreign authorities. Vlasiuk, Ukraine&apos;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy, attributes it to a simple mistake. However, Korolev&apos;s actual birth date has been widely available, including in reports by investigative journalists, several official sanctions lists, and leaked data from Russia&apos;s databases. Given the abundance of public records mentioning Korolev&apos;s correct birthdate, it&apos;s surprising that only incorrect versions appeared in the EU and Swiss sanctions lists. Whether Korolev holds any accounts, real estate, or other assets in Europe remains uncertain. What is clear is that he and his family lead a wealthy lifestyle often linked to European countries. Korolev may be an important cog in the Russian regime&#x2019;s war machine against the West and all it stands for, but the senior FSB official seems to be a believer in Western education. For years, he sent his children to take courses in pricy schools in the U.K. and Switzerland &#x2014; they can be seen in the photos published by these schools. Both of Korolev&#x2019;s children have attended summer English courses, known as the Pilgrims Course, taking place at the prestigious Harrow School in London. Photos of Anastasia Koroleva attending the course in 2014 can still be found on the school&apos;s website. Judging by the site, these are summer English courses lasting from two to six weeks. The current tuition for the course varies from 5,000 to 15,000 pounds, depending on the duration. Photos of Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s daughter Anastasia Koroleva at the Harrow School in London.

(pilgrims.co.uk)Korolev&apos;s daughter can also be seen in the 2016 and 2018 photo reports of the summer programs at the American Tassis School in Switzerland. The current price of a summer program is 8,000 Swiss francs, or $9,420. Photos of Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s daughter Anastasia Koroleva during her study at the American Tassis School in Switzerland. (tasis.smugmug.com)Korolev&#x2019;s family enjoys a wealthy lifestyle in Russia, as well. The family appears to have a range of real estate and luxury cars. In a manner typical for officials, most of it is registered in family and associates&#x2019; names. Korolev used to work at FSB in St. Petersburg, and the official has maintained connections to the city. Korolev&#x2019;s wife Marina is registered at a house in Sestroretsk, a suburb of St. Petersburg. Korolev and his daughter are registered at an apartment in St. Petersburg. While registration doesn&#x2019;t prove ownership, it usually points to a link to this property. &#xA0; Other real estate connected to Korolev&#x2019;s family is in Moscow, his current place of work. His son Boris is registered in an elite apartment in central Moscow, with an area of 200 square meters. The official owner of the apartment is Maria Koroleva, according to a BBC Russian service report. The woman appears to be Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s niece. Additionally, a large plot in the Lesnaya Bukhta housing development near Moscow was registered in the name of Korolev&apos;s son, according to previous reports. Can Korolev&#x2019;s salary at FSB pay for this lifestyle? He has never filed a public declaration, and his salary hasn&#x2019;t been made public. His predecessor was reportedly making around $180,000 a year in 2019. Yet salary may not be the only source of income &#x2014; there are traces of the family&#x2019;s business interests. In the St. Petersburg suburb, a short drive away from Korolev&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s house, there is a spa hotel Voda. According to the Russian real estate register, the hotel&#x2019;s building is owned by Shalash, a Russian company. Shalash has several owners, one of them Korolev&#x2019;s sister Tetyana Koroleva. Another co-owner is a British company, Steelcore Alliance LLP. Its beneficiary is an Uzbek citizen, Aybek Buribekov. Another company allegedly connected to Korolev&#x2019;s family is Citadel LLC, Russia&#x2019;s largest manufacturer of wiretapping equipment, mandatory for the Russian mobile operators to install. Its founders are classified in the Russian company registry. Independent Russian investigative journalists from iStories have claimed that Citadel is linked to Korolev through his alleged confidant Valery Bitaev, who co-owns the company. Incidentally, Citadel depends on FSB licensing. According to the BBC&#x2019;s Russian Service, Citadel invested in Korolev&#x2019;s son Boris Korolev&#x2019;s business venture &#x2014; a tech company called Bastion. Like with Citadel, the company owners are classified in the registry. Korolev&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s company Bastion is noteworthy by itself. Founded in 2018, the company claims to specialize in ethical hacking &#x2014; testing the vulnerabilities of other companies&apos; information systems. In the past few years, reports have surged of Russian state hackers targeting people and entities in Ukraine and Western countries. Many reports directly mention the agency behind it: It&#x2019;s FSB. Note from the author: Hello, this is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. Thank you for reading my first investigation for the Kyiv Independent. I joined the team recently, but I have been working in investigative journalism for over 10 years. I spent the last 1.5 months studying social media, photos from FSB-related events, and hacked Russian databases &#x2014; all of it to end the long-cherished secretiveness of the top official of the Russian FSB, the security service that plays a crucial role in the Russian war. This story proves that even the FSB deputy director who&#x2019;s been hiding his appearance for decades can leave unexpected traces online. All we need is the desire and the skills to find them. I love OSINT, and there will be more investigations in the Kyiv Independent.

Opinion: We're Republicans, and we're voting for Kamala Harris to back Ukraine	In the past week, both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish President Andrzej Duda made stops in Pennsylvania. Zelensky toured an ammunition factory in Scranton, while Duda attended the unveiling of a statue at the Czestochowa cemetery commemorating the Polish Solidarity movement and its fight for independence against the Soviet-backed communist regime. Both leaders were en route to the United Nations General Assembly and share deep concerns about whether the United States will continue to lead NATO&#x2019;s defense of Eastern Europe against the threat posed by Russia&#x2019;s Vladimir Putin. The outcome of the upcoming presidential election will likely determine Washington&#x2019;s role, making it crucial for Pennsylvania&#x2019;s 750,000 Polish residents and 122,000 Ukrainians to engage in the electoral process. During the presidential debate on Sept. 12, Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump declined to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. He has never criticized Putin for his invasion and the brutal bombing campaigns that have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Instead, Trump blames Zelensky for the war and has threatened to cut off aid to Ukraine. His chosen running mate, J.D. Vance, has suggested that Ukraine must concede territory to negotiate with Russia. By ignoring Russia&apos;s ongoing aggression in Ukraine and its implications for U.S. national interests and the security of European allies, Trump has aligned himself more closely with strongman Putin than with longstanding U.S. commitments to peace, democracy, and fundamental freedoms. As president, Trump did little to materially assist Ukraine and even attempted to extort the country to bolster his 2020 re-election campaign. His 2020 Republican campaign was notably silent on both Russia and Ukraine, enabling him to promote a more isolationist and ill-conceived &quot;America First&quot; vision. Vance is a staunch opponent of military and economic aid to Ukraine. Earlier this year, he publicly opposed legislation aimed at seizing Russian sovereign assets in the U.S. to aid Ukraine and shield American taxpayers from the immense damage caused by Russia. As a former U.S. Treasury Department official during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and as a Republican congressman who represented Pennsylvania for 12 years, we believe that seizing Russian overseas assets to help Ukraine would have been a priority for both former Republican presidents. Vance, however, thinks otherwise. Historically, Trump has opposed the continued existence of NATO, the cornerstone of U.S. and European security since the Cold War. On the same day that NATO convened in Washington this year, a Russian cruise missile destroyed the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital in Kyiv, prompting Trump to reiterate that he would not necessarily defend a NATO ally under Russian attack.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)His authoritarian stance has effectively given Putin the green light to act with impunity in Europe against NATO members. While U.S. President Joe Biden recently met with Zelensky, Trump welcomed Hungary&#x2019;s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Mar-a-Lago. In stark contrast to Trump&#x2019;s policies, the Biden-Harris administration acted swiftly to mobilize NATO to support Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris met with Zelensky five days beforehand to warn him of the impending threat. After the invasion, the White House imposed strong economic sanctions against Russia, including freezing Russian assets held abroad. In April, Biden signed legislation that Vance opposed, which aimed to seize those assets to assist Ukraine and protect American taxpayers. During the presidential debate, Harris pledged her unwavering support for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;righteous defense,&quot; while Trump repeatedly dodged direct questions from ABC&#x2019;s David Muir regarding his stance on Ukraine&apos;s victory over Russia. The contrast between Trump and Harris on Ukraine and Poland could not be starker. A Trump administration would continue favoring Russia over Ukraine and fail to hold Russia accountable for the devastation it inflicts on innocent civilians. Meanwhile, Harris will maintain her support for Ukraine&#x2019;s courageous fight to preserve its sovereignty and democracy, advocating for just reparations once Russia&#x2019;s illegal aggression ceases. She will also ensure that the U.S. remains a steadfast ally and protector of Poland. To the extent voters consider vital U.S. foreign policy and national security issues important this November, the only option is clear. A vote for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz is a vote for America&#x2019;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s interests in Europe, while a vote for Trump and Vance favors Russia and enables Putin&#x2019;s ongoing war of aggression.

Ukraine aims to increase ballistic missiles, long-range arms production in 2025, Umerov says	Ukraine is planning to increase its own production of drones, long-range and ballistic missiles in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the program had &quot;good dynamics.&quot; He then announced in August that Ukraine had carried out a successful test of its first domestically-made ballistic missile. According to Umerov, $4 billion has been already invested in the development of Ukrainian industry. &quot;Next year we plan to increase funding. Our priority is to develop domestic drones and long-range weapons, including ballistic missiles,&quot; the minister added. Speaking at the Forum, Umerov said that Kyiv also wants to unveil more details about a major Ukrainian missile program later this year or in 2025, Interfax-Ukraine reported. In addition, the defense ministry aims to attract foreign partners to create joint ventures to develop the defense industry. &quot;An important part of this cooperation is the signing of long-term contracts for the production, supply and maintenance of weapons to ensure that the Ukrainian army is supplied for the long term,&quot; a statement from the ministry read. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aims-to-increase-ballistic-missiles-long-range-arms-production-in-2025-umerov-says/	2024-10-02T04:19:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169444679.jpg
Ukrainian forces withdraw from Vuhledar, military announces	Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the Khortytsia group of forces said on Oct. 2. &quot;The higher command authorized a manoeuvre to withdraw units from Vuhledar in order to save personnel and military equipment, and take up a position for further operations,&quot; it said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years. Russian forces have been attempting to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Vuhledar withstood numerous attacks in recent weeks as Russian forces attempted to encircle the town. Local authorities confirmed that Russian troops entered Vuhledar on Oct. 1, adding that fighting was ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent last month. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-vuhledar/	2024-10-02T02:51:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1767720342.jpg
NATO 'inadequately' prepared for large-scale war with Russia, Hodges says	NATO lacks adequate air defenses, military mobility, ammunition, and the mindset to be fully ready for a large-scale conventional war, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said on Oct. 2. Speaking at a discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Hodges said that many of Europe&apos;s political and military leaders do not fully acknowledge the realities of a possible war with Russia. Warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with many observers pointing out insufficient defense-industrial base and battle readiness on the West&apos;s part. &quot;We don&apos;t have adequate missile and air defense to protect our seaports, airports, and critical infrastructure,&quot; Hodges said. NATO&apos;s eastern flank has only 5% of the air defense capabilities necessary to deter an attack, the Financial Times reported in May. &quot;We still... cannot move quickly throughout Europe, so the issue of military mobility is still a challenge that needs to be resolved,&quot; the retired general added. If Russia decided to attack NATO, its forces would immediately strike European transport infrastructure that the allies need to respond, the retired general commented. &quot;So imagine a week of what&apos;s happening in Ukraine to happen in Gdansk, or Klaipeda, or Tallinn, or Bremerhaven,&quot; Hodges noted. In the worst-case scenario, Lithuania would have to wait for two weeks for the arrival of reinforcements, the retired officer added. Echoing the words of his co-speaker, Romanian Defense Ministry State Secretary Simona Cojocaru, Hodges said that NATO militaries must be ready to roll out much faster than they currently can. According to the retired general, Western armies were ready for deployment within 24 hours during the Cold War, while today&apos;s militaries largely lack this mindset. NATO should have the &quot;courage to acknowledge what you see as a threat, and then start pulling ammunition out of bunkers, starting deploying troops to be prepared, and then you can be ready to go in two or three days where the risk this.&quot; Hodges added that allied leaders are often hesitant to respond fast and decisively enough, fearing such steps would be perceived as provocation. Hodges also called for investing in exercises and ammunition production to increase the alliance&apos;s military readiness. &quot;Ten and half years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and we still cannot provide enough ammunition for a week. And we&apos;ve emptied our bunkers to help.&quot; The retired general nevertheless added that European countries are &quot;moving in a much better direction,&quot; namely praising Poland&apos;s planned military transformation.	https://kyivindependent.com/hodges-russia-nato/	2024-10-02T02:50:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Hodges.jpg
Ukraine's defense procurement agencies should be kept separate, NATO reaffirms	Two Ukrainian defense procurement agencies should continue to operate separately at least during wartime, the NATO representation to Ukraine said on Oct. 1, after Kyiv&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said they could be merged. The NATO statement came days after Umerov said the ministry was planning to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) into one agency. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. Ukraine and NATO approved a number of recommendations for the Strategic Defense Procurement Review (SDPR) at the Washington summit in July. They said the two agencies should be kept separate &quot;to perform their tasks and supporting their independence and anti-corruption policies,&quot; including through the swift appointment of an independent supervisory board for each agency. Despite this, in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24, Umerov said the unification of the agencies was in its final stages. &quot;Our strategy is to hold a strategic session and unite all the agencies into one, according to NATO standards. Some kind of Ukrainian Defense Forces Agency, which will have procurement, logistics, measurement contracts, efficiency, in accordance with NATO,&quot; the minister said. But on Oct. 1 Umerov announced that seperate supervisory boards are to be set up for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) &quot;in the near future.&quot; &quot;Following Defense Minister Umerov&#x2019;s statement today, we affirm our understanding that the two agencies will be kept separate, and welcome the stated intention to appoint the two supervisory boards very soon,&quot; the NATO representation said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agencies-should-be-kept-separately-nato-reaffirms/	2024-10-02T01:53:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/umerov.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 7, injure 50 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed seven people and injured 50 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 2. Ukrainian forces downed 11 out of 32 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ten more drones were &quot;lost&quot; due to electronic warfare and four others flew back towards Russia, it added. Russian drones attacked port and border infrastructure near the town of Izmail in southern Odesa Oblast, injuring two truck drivers, Governor Oleh Kiper said. One of the victims is a citizen of Turkey. According to authorities, Russia targeted an international ferry crossing point across the Ukrainian-Romanian state border. The work of the Orlivka crossing point was temporarily suspended, Kiper said. A Russian attack on Odesa Oblast damaged an international ferry crossing point across the Ukrainian-Romanian state border overnight on Oct. 2, 2024. (Oleh Kiper/Telegram)In Kharkiv Oblast, five people, including a 14-year-old boy, were injured in a Russian guided aerial bomb attack on the town of Derhachi, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian forces also attacked the town of Kupiansk, injuring a man and a woman. One person was killed and 25 suffered injuries in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Russia launched at least six guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia, damaging apartment buildings and houses. Among the wounded were three children aged nine, 10, and 12. Five people were injured in the villages of Chernihivka and Dovha Balka as well as in the town of Sloviansk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A market and a public transport stop came under Russian attack in the city of Kherson. Six people were killed and six others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Five more people suffered injuries after Russian attacks on other settlements in Kherson Oblast over the past day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day-2/	2024-10-02T01:08:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-02_09-26-37.jpg
Don't panic' — Russia to test emergency warning systems across the country	Russia announced it will test its emergency warning systems on Oct. 2, with the government telling citizens &quot;don&apos;t panic, be calm.&quot; At 10:30 a.m. local time, sirens will sound for one minute accompanied by loudspeakers calling &quot;Attention everyone!&quot; and emergency broadcasts on TV and radio. The initiative is a twice-yearly occurrence first introduced in 2020, but which has taken on extra significance since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Sirens now sound for real in parts of the country and occupied Ukrainian territories due to Ukrainian drone and missile strikes. Meanwhile in Ukraine, air raid alerts are a daily occurrence in many parts of the country. More than 40,000 air raid sirens lasting from minutes to hours throughout the day and night have sounded across Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale war over two years ago, according to official reports. In cities heavily-targeted by Russian forces such as Kharkiv, alerts can sound multiple times a day, and last for hours at a time At the end of July, Kharkiv broke the record for having the longest air raid siren since the start of the full-scale invasion. It lasted for nearly two days, starting at around 6:31 p.m. on July 23 and ending at around 9:02 p.m. on July 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/dont-panic-russia-to-test-emergency-warning-systems-across-the-country/	2024-10-01T23:47:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1236042896.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 655,560 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 655,560 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 2. This number includes 1,130 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,887 tanks, 17,579 armored fighting vehicles, 25,692 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,869 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 963 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,348 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-655-560-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-01T22:10:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165781751.jpg
US VP debate passes with no questions, comments about Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine	The U.S. vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 between Republican Senator J.D. Vance and Democratic Governor Tim Walz touched on a variety of domestic issues, and some foreign policy, but did not include a single question &#x2014; or comments from either candidate &#x2014; on Russia&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine. Vance, who was selected as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&apos;s running mate in July, has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine. He has repeatedly said that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. There was speculation that the debate could be an opportunity for Walz to hammer Vance on his isolationist views and his recent controversial comments about a proposed peace plan in Ukraine. In September, Vance said in an interview that Trump&apos;s potential plan to end the war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added. Later in the month, President Volodymyr Zelensky characterized Vance&apos;s views on the war as being &quot;too radical&quot; and said that he did not &quot;consider this concept of his, a plan, in any formal sense.&quot; Alexander Vindman, the former director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, told the Kyiv Independent ahead of the debate that the showdown was &quot;important&quot; because it would allow Walz to &quot;punch holes into Vance&apos;s worldview.&quot; But besides the first question, which was focused on the ongoing multifaceted conflict in the Middle East, the moderators instead opted to ask questions about abortion, the economy, childcare, and other pocketbook issues. Ukraine was not mentioned at all, and Russia was referenced only once &#x2014; in a passing comment from Vance about Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in September, Ukraine was the focus of one of the main foreign policy debates. Harris hit Trump on his repeated pledge that he would end the war in 24 hours and accused the former president of planning to &quot;give up&quot; Ukraine. &quot;That&apos;s not who we are as Americans,&quot; Harris added. With the apparent gap between the policies on Ukraine between the two tickets, commentators on CNN were puzzled that Vance and Walz were not asked any questions about the largest land war in Europe since World War II.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-vp-debate-passes-with-no-questions-comments-about-russias-full-scale-war-on-ukraine/	2024-10-01T20:18:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175342835.jpg
US sanctions Russia-based cybercrime group 'Evil Corp'	The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on Oct. 1 against seven individuals and two entities associated with Evil Corp, a Russia-based cybercrime group. The Treasury&apos;s sanctions coincided with an indictment from the U.S. Justice Department against an Evil Corp member, as well as additional measures from the U.K. and Australia. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Evil Corp is &quot;responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware.&quot; &quot;Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers,&quot; Miller added. Evil Corp&apos;s leader and founder, Maksim Yakubets, was first sanctioned by the Treasury&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019. At the same time, the Justice Department indicted Yakubets and another Evil Corp member and issued a $5 million reward for information leading to their capture and subsequent conviction. &quot;Today&apos;s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,&quot; said Treasury official Bradley Smith. In its statement, the Treasury noted that Yakubets and other Evil Corp members have links to Russian politicians and other government figures. Yakubets is also employed at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK), which the Treasury said he uses as a &quot;cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp.&quot; The U.K.&apos;s National Crime Agency further said that one of the newly sanctioned Evil Corp members, Eduard Benderskiy, a former member of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB), &quot;used his extensive influence with the Russian state to protect the group.&quot; Prior to 2019, Russian intelligence &quot;tasked Evil Corp to conduct cyber attacks and espionage operations against NATO allies,&quot; the U.K. said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russia-based-cybercrime-group-evil-corp/	2024-10-01T18:02:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1186593483.jpg
Russia desperate to recruit workers at defense plants amid personnel shortage, BBC reports	Russian defense production facilities are recruiting tens of thousands of factory workers amid an acute personnel shortage, the BBC&apos;s Russian service reported on Oct. 1. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has drained Russia&apos;s labor market and prompted fierce competition between the military and business for new recruits. At the same time, Russia&apos;s all-out war has dramatically increased the production of weapons and military equipment. Russia has posted thousands of job ads for shift workers at defense enterprises, enticing workers with triple the standard pay, recruiting young people, and offering rewards for referrals of new hires, the BBC&apos;s investigation found. More than 90,000 vacancies for defense industry jobs appeared on Russian job portals between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15, the BBC reported. Salaries for high-demand specialties were often three to four times higher than the average regional salary. Russia faces a shortage of engineers, turners, and CNC machine operators. The Russian job portal Avito in September received 2,000 resumes for turners, in comparison to 60,000 position openings. For CNC operators, there were only 600 resumes for 18,600 vacancies, despite the alluring salaries. At Kurganmashzavod, a plant that produces infantry fighting vehicles in Russia&apos;s Kurgan Oblast, there were 78 open slots for machine tool adjusters and CNC operatiors as of Sept. 4, the investigation found. The shortage of defense facility workers corresponds to Russia&apos;s overall labor shortage, exacerbated by military mobilization and the decreasing number of migrants entering the country. Russia also faces a population crisis, with an expected decline of around 7 million over the next two decades. In addition to offering higher salaries, factories have enticed workers by providing temporary housing to employees recruited from other regions. The Tatarstan Republic reportedly implemented a program in spring 2024 to employ minors aged 14-18 in the defense industry. A draft amendment to the legislation on alternative service submitted to Russia&apos;s State Duma in June 2024 proposed letting new conscripts choose defense industry work as an alternate to military service. Shift work in Russian defense industry plants is often brutal, the BBC reported. Some positions advertised 11-hour shifts with no days off. When a BBC correspondent phoned a company to clarify the details about the length of a shift, the recruiter refused to provide the information, but immediately offered to hire the reporter.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-desperate-to-recruit-workers-at-defense-plants-amid-personnel-shortage-bbc-reports/	2024-10-01T16:26:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1246325284.jpg
Ukraine evacuates 179 people from Lebanon	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) and Foreign Ministry evacuated 179 people from Lebanon on Oct. 1 amid escalating violence in the Middle East, the Foreign Ministry reported. The evacuation comes after Israel on Oct. 1 launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon as part of its campaign against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. In the days leading up to the incursion, Israel intensified aerial attacks against Lebanon, killing hundreds. Iran retaliated aganst the incursion with a missile attack against an Israeli air base. In a statement following Israel&apos;s ground invasion, the Foreign Ministry called on all parties &quot;to exercise maximum restraint in order to prevent the conflict from developing into a large-scale regional war.&quot; Ukraine later announced it had successfully evacuated 179 people, including 134 Ukrainian citizens. &quot;Among the Ukrainians, there are 112 adults and 22 children,&quot; the Foreign Ministry &#xA0;said. &quot;In addition, 45 people of other nationalities were evacuated&#x2014; citizens of Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Moldova, Brazil and Lebanon.&quot; A dog and a cat were included in the evacuation, the ministry added. Kyiv began evacuating Ukrainians from Lebanon in early August in response to heightening tensions in the region. Since then, Ukraine has evacuated 234 people from Lebanon. The ministry thanked Poland and SkyUp Airlines for assisting with the operation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-evacuates-179-people-from-lebanon/	2024-10-01T15:12:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/lebanon.jpg
FM Sybiha meets Polish president in Warsaw	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and bilateral relations between the two countries, Sybiha said on Oct. 1. Sybiha met with a number of Polish and other E.U. officials on Oct. 1 on the sidelines of the Warsaw Security Forum. &#xA0; &quot;We discussed Ukraine&apos;s priority defense needs, further military aid, invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, and our path to EU membership,&quot; Sybiha said on X of his meeting with Duda. &quot;We also identified ways to strengthen our good-neighborly bilateral relations.&quot; The foreign minister&apos;s meeting with Duda comes at a time of heightened tensions between Poland and Ukraine. The 1943 Volyn (Volhynia) massacre is once again at the forefront of Polish-Ukrainain relations, as the lack of resolution over the historic killings continues to surface in modern-day negotiations. During World War II, &#xA0;members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Thus far, reconciliation efforts between Poland and Ukraine have not succeeded. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Sept. 13 called on the Ukrainian government to resolve the matter, saying it is &quot;a non-political issue that cannot be bargained over.&quot; Earlier in July, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Ukraine would not be able to join the E.U. until it had settled the Volyn issue. Duda criticized these remarks, saying that obstructing Ukraine&apos;s E.U. accession aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s policies. Sikorski sparked further backlash in Ukraine among the Crimean Tatar community after he said on Sept. 19 that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv should include &quot;demilitarizing&quot; the Crimean peninsula, which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/fm-sybiha-meets-polish-president-in-warsaw/	2024-10-01T14:00:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/poland.jpeg

Ukraine war latest: Russian forces reportedly capture most of Vuhledar, Kyiv doesn't comment	Key developments on Oct. 1: Russian troops have entered the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 1, adding that fighting is ongoing. Speaking on national television, Filashkin described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult,&quot; adding: &quot;The enemy has already almost reached the center of the town.&quot; &quot;The fighting is going on within the town, so it is almost impossible to bring in humanitarian aid.&quot; Later in the day, videos emerged on social media showing Russian soldiers flying the country&apos;s flag on the roof of an apartment building in the town. Geolocated to the northern streets of Vuhledar&apos;s small and dense urban area, the videos suggest that a complete Ukrainian withdrawal from the town is highly likely. A total of 107 civilians remain in Vuhledar, though all children have been evacuated, he added. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState on Oct. 1, Russian soldiers entered Vuhledar from the west and south. In recent days, Russian forces advanced northeast of Vuhledar and on the western outskirts of the town, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Sept. 30, citing geolocated footage. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. Russian troops are trying to seize new positions in the Zaporizhzhia sector to improve their tactical position, Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 1. Voloshyn said there were indications that Russian forces were gathering troops near the towns of Pryiutne and Robotyne in order to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;There are certain signs that (the enemy) is taking such steps: concentrating personnel and moving them to the front line, training these assault groups, accumulating ammunition,&quot; he said. Following Kyiv&apos;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russia reportedly began moving its troops from Ukraine&apos;s south and east to the Russian region, but Voloshyn said the number of troops in the Zaporizhzhia sector remained around the same. Russia has only redeployed certain units and specialists to the Kursk direction and is increasing the number of personnel by 2,000-3,000 soldiers per week to replenish losses, Voloshyn said. According to Voloshyn, Russia does not have enough troops to launch a large-scale offensive. &quot;No such groups have been spotted so far. Therefore, we can only say that the enemy is preparing for (smaller) assaults,&quot; Voloshyn said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure. Ukraine can use domestically-produced weapons to hit targets inside Russia, and does not need U.S. permission to do so, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing on Sept. 30. Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. In turn, Ukraine has carried out successful attacks on targets inside Russia with homemade arms, namely long-range drones. Over the past year, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said last month. According to Miller, Kyiv can use &quot;many&quot; domestically-made weapons, and has &quot;an enormous amount of material to defend itself.&quot; Ukraine is also hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last month ahead of meetings between U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. When asked why Washington could not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike back, the spokesperson said that the White House considers all capabilities, tactics and support for Ukraine comprehensively. &quot;When we approve any new weapon system or any new tactic, we look at how it&#x2019;s going to affect the entire battlefield and Ukraine&#x2019;s entire strategy. &#xA0;And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll continue to do,&quot; he added. &quot;And if you look at the weapons we&apos;ve provided them, we&apos;ve made it very clear that they can use them to retaliate against Russian targets across the border that are conducting attacks. &quot;We are always looking to see if there are additional tools we can provide them.&quot; In late August, Umerov submitted to senior U.S. officials a list of targets that Ukraine wants to hit with U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles in Russia, which included airfields used by the Russian army to launch strikes against population centers across Ukraine. Russian forces appear to have shot 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Donetsk Oblast, the largest recorded case of mass execution of surrendered soldiers on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Oct. 1. Evidence of the execution appeared on social media earlier on Oct. 1. The POWs were reportedly killed after surrendering on the front line near Pokrovsk. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said it was verifying the material published online and investigating the circumstances around the case. The execution of POWs is a &quot;cynical and gross violation of the Geneva Conventions,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. &quot;This is the most massive known case of execution of Ukrainian POWs on the front line,&quot; Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said. &quot;The murders and torture of prisoners are not an accident, but a purposeful policy of the Russian military and political leadership,&quot; he added. In early September, Russian forces executed three Ukrainian POWs near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said earlier this year that it was investigating more than 50 cases of execution of Ukrainian POWs. Russian forces attacked a substation connected to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), cutting off a power line to the facility, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on Oct. 1. The attack put the plant &quot;on the verge&quot; of a blackout again, the ministry said in a statement, adding work was underway to restore full power. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. &quot;We demand to immediately implement the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) resolution and return the occupied nuclear power plant under Ukraine&apos;s control. The safe operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP is possible only under Ukraine&apos;s control,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The plant has already experienced eight complete blackouts, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. He did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-forces-enter-vuhledar-situation-extremely-difficult-governor-says/	2024-10-01T13:02:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325594-2.jpg
Ukraine boosts defense production, successfully tests ballistic missile, Zelensky says	Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Ukraine hosted its first international defense industry forum in fall 2023, bringing together over 250 defense contractors from around the world. This year&apos;s forum, held in Kyiv, included nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries. Zelensky&apos;s address highlighted Ukraine&apos;s success in boosting its defense produciton capacity. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said. According to the president, Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones per year and has already contracted 1.5 million. The country is also producing between 15-20 Bohdana howitzers per month. Zelensky also discussed the development of long-range weapons, including Ukraine&apos;s Palianytsia missile-drone and homegrown ballistic missile. &quot;Our new ballistic missile has successfully passed flight tests,&quot; he said. Zelensky first mentioned that Ukraine had tested its own ballistic missile in late August, though he did not share details about the project. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not altered its policy on long-range strikes. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Sept. 30 that Kyiv can strike targets in the Russian interior using Ukrainian-made weapons without permission from the U.S. &#xA0; Ukraine has had success hitting military targets, including airfields and ammunition depots, deep in Russian territory using long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-boosts-defense-production-successfully-tests-ballistic-missile-zelensky-says/	2024-10-01T12:55:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky.jpeg
The words of Ukraine’s fallen soldiers inspiring the nation to fight on	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The following is the latest in a series of reports by the Kyiv Independent about the memorialization of Ukraine&#x2019;s fallen soldiers. Ukrainians gathered at war memorials around the country on Oct. 1, the country&#x2019;s National Defenders Day, to honor the soldiers killed defending their country from Russia&apos;s invasion. At 9:00 a.m. on Kyiv&#x2019;s Independence Square, a couple hundred people stood in silence as cars on the busy street stopped for a few minutes to commemorate the fallen. Many held the portraits of defenders &#x2014; their friends, relatives and loved ones, killed or captured by Russia &#x2014; a testament to a fight that is paid for with the blood of its citizens who have chosen to take up arms to defend their country. Among the photos and flags on Independence Square, each representing a human life, people also held up handwritten signs. &#x201C;All the beautiful ones stay optimistic,&#x201D; said one sign, quoting a prominent Ukrainian activist and fighter Pavlo Petrychenko, who was killed on the front earlier this year. He represented a new generation that grew up in an independent Ukraine but had to fight for their country&#x2019;s survival and better future most of their adult lives as activists and soldiers. A third year into the existential war waged by Russia, Ukrainians are widely quoting many of them, finding inspiration in the words they left behind. The Kyiv Independent put together some of their most shared quotes that are becoming a part of the nation&#x2019;s legacy. A journalist and educator in civilian life, Iryna Tsybukh volunteered as a military medic during the full-scale Russian invasion. She shared her patriotic views on social media for tens of thousands of followers, becoming a leading voice on the memorialization of fallen soldiers and a &#x201C;moral compass&#x201D; for many Ukrainians. After Tsybukh was killed during a frontline evacuation in May, her brother published her posthumous letter that received over 100,000 likes on Instagram, inspiring many people: &#x201C;To have freedom, you need to also hold other kinds of values. You need to understand yourself, to clearly know who you are for yourself, what your personal happiness is, and how you can reach it. Once you have the answers to this question, the most important thing is to keep going.&#x201D; Iryna Tsybukh, a journalist and educator in civilian life, volunteered as a military medic and was killed on the front line. (Iryna Tsybukh / Facebook)Nazarii Hryntsevych, 21One of the youngest defenders of Mariupol who survived Russia&apos;s siege of the city&apos;s Azovstal steel mill and Russian captivity, Nazarii Hryntsevych continued to fight in the Azov regiment after he returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap. Hryntsevych&#x2019;s most famous quote came from his comrade&#x2019;s Instagram story, where he speaks in an Azovstal shelter &#x2014; fully equipped for a fight, fresh wound on his face: &#x201C;Whatever you got going, love your mom, eat your porridge, and love Ukraine.&#x201D; Nazarii Hryntsevych, call sign &quot;Hrinka.&quot; (Screenshot of LB Live video/YouTube)Roman Ratushny, 24At 16, Roman Ratushny was among a large group of Ukrainian students violently attacked and beaten by the Ukrainian riot police during their peaceful protest in 2013 against President Viktor Yanukovych&#x2019;s pro-Kremlin government. The ensuing public outrage sparked the Euromaidan revolution. Ratushny, one of the prominent young activists who emerged there, fought illegal construction in a Kyiv park despite the threats from Ukrainian oligarchs before he volunteered to fight for Ukraine in 2022. After he was killed in battle the same year, people were galvanized by his adamant views that peace in Ukraine is impossible while Ukrainians tolerate any kind of Russian influence: &#x201C;Burn the whole Russian subculture within yourselves. Burn all childhood memories related to the Russian-Soviet. Burn your relationships with relatives or friends on the other side, with everyone who is a carrier of the Russian subculture. Otherwise, it will burn you out.&#x201D; Roman Ratushnyi was one of the most prominent Kyiv activists. He took part in the EuroMaidan Revolution at the age of 16, later standing up to Ukrainian oligarchs and corrupt officials. He volunteered to fight for Ukraine when the full-scale invasion started. Last June, 24-year-old Ratushnyi was killed in Kharkiv Oblast. (Courtesy) Andrii Pilshchykov, 30Andrii Pilshchykov, a Ukrainian top gun pilot of the new generation known as &#x2018;Juice,&#x2019; was instrumental in Ukraine&apos;s efforts to get its first batch of F-16 fighter jets from Western allies in August. Having trained with American pilots before, he used his high-profile status for numerous interviews with Western media and personal connections in the U.S. Air Force to persuade Western partners to send the fighter jets to Ukraine during a media campaign stretching for over two years. After many successful battle missions, Pilshchykov was killed in a mid-air collision of two Ukrainian jets in 2023. On Sept. 30, the eve of the Defenders Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded him the title Hero of Ukraine. Like many activists, he urged Ukrainians to prepare for the hard fight in his posts online: &#x201C;I am reminding you that we have not won yet. There are still many battles ahead. This is not the time to relax. Learn, train, get equipped, act. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.&#x201D; Portrait of Ukrainian fighter pilot Andrii Pilshchykov. (Sasha Maslov / Ministry of Defense of Ukraine / Wikimedia)Maksym Kryvtsov, 33Maksym Kryvtsov was a poet and a photographer whose sensitive work is bound to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, which he fought for seven years in the Ukrainian army. A machine gunner on the front, Kryvtsov had a unique connection with his readers that continued online. A day before he was killed in a Russian artillery strike on his position, he posted verses from his first and only book, &#x201C;Poems From The Loophole,&#x201D; as his Facebook readers posted numbers of the specific lines and pages they wanted to see. &#x201C;Ninety percent of the poems here are about death,&#x201D; he wrote then before his own name became a synonym for the new generation of Ukrainian artists killed by Russia. Now, Ukrainians quote a line of his poem that speaks about the many deaths that Russia&#x2019;s war brought to Ukraine: &#x201C;When people ask me what war is, I will answer without hesitation: names.&#x201D; Ukrainian poet and soldier Maksym Kryvtsov, who has been killed on the front line. (Maksym Kryvtsov/Facebook)Dmytro Kotsiubailo, 27Dmytro Kotsiubailo was the first volunteer fighter outside the Ukrainian army to receive the title &#x201C;Hero of Ukraine&#x201D; during his lifetime. One of the youngest commanders in Ukrainian history, he served for all 10 years of his adult life, leading his battalion &#x201C;Da Vinci Wolves.&#x201D; For someone called &#x201C;legendary,&#x201D; Kotsiubailo carried himself humbly and treasured his troops. He was mortally wounded by Russian artillery in 2023 while checking if everyone in his unit took shelter during the attack. In his last interview with Ukrainian media, Kotsiubailo&#x2019;s dedication and belief in his comrades shines in the final sentence: &#x201C;Weapons are good, but everything depends on people. Our people are the best. They will master anything, they will do anything. That&apos;s why we will win.&#x201D; As a prominent activist at the forefront of Ukrainian civil society, Pavlo Petrychenko participated in EuroMaidan, fought to prosecute corrupt officials, and demanded justice for fellow activists, such as his friend Kateryna Handziuk, who was killed in a politically motivated attack in 2018. For the first few months of Russia&apos;s full-blown invasion, Petrychenko helped build one of the largest volunteer organizations currently aiding the Ukrainian army, the Serhii Prytula Charity Foundation. When he joined the army as a drone operator, Petrychenko kept speaking out against injustice in his sharp interviews and tweets. He was killed days before his latest online petition caused President Zelensky to sign a decree on April 20 to restrict online gambling among soldiers &#x2014; a testament to his signature determination: &#x201C;We just gotta keep pressing and pressing, and they ought to fall. Because in this war, we stand for the truth. And whoever stands for the truth must win. It has always been so through history. And if we endure this moment, then we must win.&#x201D; Pavlo Petrychenko was a well-known activist and junior sergeant of the 59th Brigade. He was killed in combat on April 15, 2024, just a day before his 32nd birthday. (Courtesy of Prytula Foundation / Viktor Zalevskiy)Kostiantyn Yuzviuk, 23Throughout his life, animal rights activist and volunteer Kostiantyn Yuzviuk seemed to know exactly where he stood in his views and lived up to them, promoting veganism, fighting the violent treatment of animals, rescuing pets from the front, and volunteering to fight in the Ukrainian army. His views made a difference beyond his lifetime after his unique personal funeral that he designed himself. Yuzviuk&#x2019;s story touched many Ukrainians and made it an inspiration for others &#x2014; exactly as he once advised: &#x201C;Look for motivation within yourself, or become one for somebody else.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-words-of-ukraines-fallen-soldiers-inspiring-the-nation-to-fight-on/	2024-10-01T12:31:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/_DSC7669-2.jpg
Ukraine will be 2nd strongest NATO member' in Europe, Latvian FM says	Ukraine will have the second-strongest military in NATO on the European continent once it joins the alliance, Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze said on Oct. 1. Speaking at a panel discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Braze pointed out that Ukraine&apos;s military will have &quot;experience in battle&quot; and a &quot;clear political commitment to be the best.&quot; &quot;Ukraine will be the second strongest NATO member, at least on the European continent,&quot; the minister noted, adding that it will be surpassed only by the major military players like the U.S. and Turkey. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 but has yet to receive a formal invitation. Despite high expectations in Kyiv, the last two allied summits brought only new steps toward deepening Ukraine-NATO cooperation and a declaration that the country&apos;s membership path is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, Ukraine has not only mobilized a large force to fend off the Russian invasion but also received extensive Western arms supplies and training and has deepened interoperability with NATO militaries. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said during the same discussion that his country &quot;must be a part of the transatlantic family&quot; and that the transatlantic community needs Ukraine to &quot;guarantee security&quot; and &quot;get more competitive advantages.&quot; Responding to a question on what the West can do to help Kyiv further, Sybiha named the necessity of acknowledging Ukraine&apos;s future NATO and EU membership. This entails implementing policies that recognize this, for example, in the EU budget. &quot;This budget must reflect... that Ukraine is the member of the EU, it must be the budget of enlargement.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s chief diplomat also listed crucial military capabilities that his country needs, including &quot;air defense systems, artillery shells, and drones&quot; and a help with scaling up Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Sybiha further underscored the need for international support for Ukraine&apos;s peace formula. He explained that President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, recently presented in the U.S., does not replace the formula but serves as a tool for its implementation. &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, no compromises on our territorial integrity and sovereignty, and no compromises with the aggressor at the expense of Ukraine,&quot; the foreign minister named Kyiv&apos;s conditions. &quot;We don&apos;t have the privilege to tolerate gray zones or frozen conflicts in Europe,&quot; Sybiha said, stressing that the matter of territorial integrity includes Crimea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-be-2nd-strongest-nato-member-in-europe-latvian-fm-says/	2024-10-01T12:19:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-455528558.jpg

Estonia's planned 'war tax' unprecedented, defense minister says	Tallinn&apos;s planned security tax is &quot;unprecedented,&quot; but &quot;everybody in Estonia understands that we have to do more,&quot; Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said on Oct. 1. Speaking at a panel discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Pevkur explained that &quot;everybody in the society will contribute a bit more.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s unprecedented that in Estonia, we will introduce a security tax, or war tax, however you call it.&quot; The Estonian parliament is currently considering a security tax bill proposed in reaction to Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. The legislation would apply a 2% security tax on individual and business profits starting Jan. 1, 2026, and increase the value-added tax (VAT) from 22% to 24% from July 2025. The measure would be in force until the end of 2028. Tallinn has also allocated 0.25% of its yearly GDP to support Ukraine&apos;s military needs in the coming years, calling on other partners to do the same. &quot;We are investing 3.4% (of GDP) into defense, we will go to 3.7% in 2026. Of this money, we are investing around 52-54% only in capabilities and capabilities development,&quot; Pevkur said. &quot;There will be a couple of years when we will invest 25% of our defense budget only to ammunition.&quot; Among NATO members, Estonia devoted the second-greatest share of its GDP to the defense budget in 2024, with only Poland investing more, at 4.12%. The U.S. is projected to come third, with 3.38%, followed by Estonia&apos;s neighbor Latvia. While the number of countries that meet the 2% GDP benchmark jumped to 23 this year, Pevkur believes that this threshold is no longer sufficient. &quot;We have to go to 2.5%, maybe 3%, because this gap that we have from the last 30 years is just too big.&quot; The minister noted that in the &quot;last 25 years, European Union countries increased their defense spending by 43%. At the same time, Russia increased its defense spending by 592%.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-war-tax/	2024-10-01T11:13:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSC02033.jpg
Neither side has political will to solve conflict.' Explaining Ukrainian-Polish deteriorating relations	A meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Sept. 13 in Kyiv did not go as planned. Sikorski demanded Ukraine finally allow the exhumation of Volyn massacre victims and warned against expecting a quick EU accession, sparking frustration from Zelensky, according to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s sources familiar with the matter. Zelensky reportedly accused Warsaw of politicizing historical events, falling short on promised military aid, and not fully backing Ukraine&apos;s path to EU membership. Zelensky later shared a negative opinion about the meeting with a number of people behind closed doors. Relations between Ukraine and Poland have turned sour. Again. And the tune is much the same &#x2013; a World War II massacre that has been at the center of bilateral relations between the two countries since the 1990s. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing grievances that are far from being resolved. In 2023, Warsaw banned Ukrainian agricultural imports amid large-scale protests from Polish farmers who complained about the domestic market&#x2019;s oversaturation with Ukrainian grain. This was followed by a months-long border blockade by Polish truckers over the EU&apos;s liberalization of transit rules for Ukrainian carriers, worsening tensions and harming Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. The conflict was resolved, yet political tension remained, despite a new government in power. A year later, a new conflict is brewing, this time a historical one. Poland has long pushed for exhumations of victims of the 1943 Volyn Massacre, the killings of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in the German-occupied Volyn region, now part of Ukraine.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Ukraine blocked the exhumation in 2017 after Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland were vandalized. Kyiv has said it is open to lifting the ban once all memorials are restored. Neither happened. The conflict is now in the open, and a resolution seems unlikely without political will from both sides. &#x201C;Polish-Ukrainian relations have been shaped by the interplay of historical legacies, domestic politics, and external factors, with the trajectory being de facto a sinusoid. We have seen &#x2018;highs and lows&#x2019; in the past, and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future,&#x201D; said Andriy Korniychuk, a policy analyst at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. &#x201C;What is different now as opposed to the previous decade is an unprecedented level of political polarization in Poland in 2024, driven by political forces on both sides of the ideological spectrum in recent years.&#x201D; In July, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Ukraine would not join the EU without resolving the historical issue of the mass killings of Poles in Volyn. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk later supported this statement, adding that &quot;Ukrainians must understand joining the union means entering the sphere of standards related to political and historical culture,&quot; as cited by the Polish Press Agency. Onet reported, citing an anonymous source, that the Polish Foreign Ministry might use Ukraine&apos;s EU bid to pressure Kyiv on the Volyn issue during Warsaw&apos;s presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2025. Polish President Andrzej Duda said, however, that threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy. The foreign ministries of Ukraine and Poland did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s requests for comments at the time of publication. Ukraine is reportedly frustrated with Poland raising WWII-era issues during Russia&apos;s ongoing war when Ukraine urgently needs support from allies to survive. However, Warsaw sees no contradiction between trying to resolve the exhumation issue and helping Ukraine in its war with Russia, according to Daniel Szeligowski, head of the Eastern Europe Programme and chief analyst on Ukraine at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM). &quot;From the Polish point of view, it is difficult to understand why Germany can carry out the exhumation of fallen Wehrmacht soldiers on Ukrainian territory, but Poland cannot exhume the bodies of its own citizens. This in no way affects the position of the Ukrainian army at the front line,&quot; Szeligowski told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine maintains that Poland has failed to fulfill its part of the agreement, namely restoring a memorial plaque on the grave of Ukrainian Insurgent Army fighters on Mount Monasterz near the border with Ukraine to its original form. The plaque was physically repaired after vandalism in 2015 but without the names of fallen UPA fighters on it. Both countries differ on how to interpret the Volyn massacre, with Poland labeling it genocide for which UPA is fully responsible and Ukraine denying the term and pushing for recognizing mutual responsibility for the killings. Ukraine and Poland also don&apos;t agree on the number of victims. Szeligowski said the exhumation issue arises every year around the tragedy&apos;s anniversary in July, regardless of who&apos;s in power. But this time, tensions worsened after a controversial comment by former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba during a meeting with young people in Poland in August.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels, Belgium, on Aug. 29, 2024. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)When asked about why Ukraine is not allowing the exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims, Kuleba moved the topic to the Polish operation Vistula, a forced resettlement of thousands of Ukrainians traditionally living in southeastern regions of Poland in 1947. Kuleba referred to the operation as occurring on &quot;Ukrainian lands.&quot; Kuleba&apos;s statement angered Polish politicians, mainly from the Law and Justice Party (PiS), who accused Kuleba of making territorial claims. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry, in a comment to the Polish Press Agency, denied the allegation and clarified that Kuleba meant areas historically inhabited by Ukrainians. The friction continued when Sikorski suggested during an off-the-record meeting at the YES conference in Kyiv on Sept. 19 to put Crimea under a U.N. mandate and carry out a referendum on the peninsula, which has been under Russian illegal occupation for over 10 years. The Crimean Tatars&apos; chief executive-representative body dismissed the proposal about Crimea&apos;s status as &quot;unacceptable and cynical,&quot; while Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said that &quot;the territorial integrity of Ukraine has never been and cannot be a subject for discussion or compromise.&quot; Kyiv is also reportedly unhappy with Poland&apos;s delay in contributing to the Czech-led ammunition procurement for Ukraine and its reluctance to help defend Ukrainian airspace. Warsaw had committed to considering such a possibility in a bilateral security agreement signed by the two countries on July 8, but the Polish defense minister quickly stepped back, citing the lack of a NATO-level decision. Sikorski cited the detention of a key official as the reason for the delay in transferring the funds for ammunition procurement, promising 100 million euros for the initiative by 2025. Over two years into Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Polish sentiment toward Ukrainian refugees is shifting, with 61% wishing they would return home after hostilities end, according to a June poll from the Warsaw University and Warsaw Academy of Economics and Humanities. Only a third of Poles strongly believe their country should continue helping Ukraine, down from 62% in January 2023. Additionally, 72% think Poland should prioritize its own interests, including agricultural exports. &#x201C;The narrative on Ukraine is changing in Poland,&#x201D; said Yaroslav Hrytsak, a Ukrainian historian and writer. He noted a rising discourse in Poland, potentially fueled by Russia, claiming that &quot;Ukrainians are taking our jobs, receiving social benefits that we do not have, and what&#x2019;s more important, they have a different mentality.&quot; Ukrainian evacuees queue as they wait for transportation after crossing the border from Ukraine into Poland on March 29, 2022, amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.(Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)Over 100 farmers are blocking the road with their tractors, driving very slowly, in a protest against duty-free trade with Ukraine in Grojec, Poland, on Feb. 9, 2024. (Piotr Lapinski/NurPhoto via Getty Images)This shift is reflected in Polish politicians&#x2019; increasing criticism of Ukraine as they prepare for the May 2025 presidential election, experts say. Kosiniak-Kamysz&apos;s remarks on the Volyn massacre align with the sentiment of his agrarian party, while Tusk and Sikorski&apos;s comments may aim to steal voters from the Law and Justice Party (PiS), which is conservative and had long focused on the country&#x2019;s historical grievances, according to Dr. Stanislav Zhelikhovskyi, a Ukrainian political scientist and a corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Geopolitics and Geostrategy. Sikorski&#x2019;s suggestion of a potential referendum in Russian-occupied Crimea could also be a political maneuver targeting a more conservative electorate as he likely eyes a presidential bid, Zhelikhovskyi told the Kyiv Independent. Korniychuk also highlighted the significance of historical narratives and their influence on public discourse and political mobilization in Poland. &#x201C;It comes against the (backdrop) of a European trend that sees far-right parties and movements gaining an alarming level of mainstream recognition,&#x201D; he said, speaking with the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Therefore, the ruling center-left coalition in Poland simply can&#x2019;t allow itself to refrain from leaving these issues unaddressed, thus allowing center-right, conservative, nationalist, and radical political forces to set the temperature of the discussion but also actively exploit different messages in their own political campaigns.&#x201D; Conversely, Szeligowski argues that the deterioration of the Volyn massacre dispute reflects unmet expectations rather than political agendas. After the Russian full-scale invasion, many Polish politicians hoped that Warsaw&#x2019;s large-scale support for Ukraine would prompt Kyiv to unblock the exhumations, according to Szeligowski. &#x201C;As this did not happen and recent statements from the Ukrainian side were widely perceived in Poland as antagonistic, a consensus has emerged among the main political forces in Poland that the policy towards Ukraine had been too little assertive and too little transactional,&#x201D; he said. With Poland&apos;s presidential elections approaching and no resolution in sight over fundamental disagreements on the Volyn massacre, the Polish-Ukrainian conflict will likely persist. &quot;This pre-election game will continue for months, likely with more criticisms and actions from Polish politicians seeking to win votes,&quot; said Zhelikhovskyi. He predicts that relations may stabilize after the elections, but they won&apos;t return to the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period of 2022. Hrytsak believes neither country has the political will to resolve the issues of exhuming Volyn massacre victims or restoring Ukrainian memorials in Poland, suggesting both sides may be using the conflict for political gain. Hrytsak suggested that Zelensky&apos;s team might use Polish threats to block Ukraine&apos;s EU membership over the Volyn massacre to shift blame onto Poland for what would likely be a slower accession than the government had promised Ukrainians. Szeligowski believes that &quot;the greater the delay by Ukraine in unblocking the exhumations, the greater the political cost that Ukraine will bear in the future.&quot; &quot;First, Poland may reduce its diplomatic activity in support of Ukraine &#x2014; instead of being always in the front row and keep mobilizing allies, Poland may stand in the rear pragmatically like Germany or simply be passive,&quot; said Szeligowski. He also noted that the ratification of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession treaty might not only run into problems in Poland due to the lack of a parliamentary majority but even be put to a referendum, with uncertain outcomes if historical disputes persist. However, simply allowing the exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims and restoring Ukrainian memorials in Poland would not be enough for a full reconciliation between Ukraine and Poland, which saw multiple conflicts in the past. To ensure good neighborly relations, Ukraine must officially take responsibility for the Volyn massacre as an act of ethnic cleansing, while Poland should admit to its repressive policies against Ukrainians prior to the massacre, said Hrytsak. However, it&apos;s hard to imagine Ukraine admitting that some of its national resistance forces had conducted ethnic cleansing during World War II amid Ukraine&apos;s existential fight against the Russian war of aggression, which kills Ukrainian civilians on a daily basis. Therefore, Hrytsak believes the Polish-Ukrainian conflict will unlikely be solved until the end of Russia&apos;s war. Korniychuk echoed this statement, saying that &#x201C;amid an ongoing brutal war, it is extremely difficult to contest and revise historical narratives and symbolic spaces as it requires a thorough process of public debate and consultation, which is de facto impossible during martial law.&#x201D; &#x201C;Hence, we can also observe Russia&apos;s deliberate targeting of these contentious historical issues in its propaganda and disinformation campaigns against both countries at what seems to be another critical juncture during the full-scale war,&#x201D; he added. Korniychuk suggested that Poland and Ukraine should try to find common ground in the framework of strategic communication, ensuring that the challenges are recognized even if addressing them would take time. &#x201C;In the end, silence and disagreements simply allow other malicious actors, such as Russia, to impact or hijack the narrative.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/historical-grievances-resurface-in-polish-ukrainian-relations-threatening-to-stall-kyivs-eu-accession/	2024-10-01T11:09:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
European defense manufacturer KNDS opens office in Ukraine	French-German defense company KNDS has opened an office in Kyiv to support Ukraine carry out the domestic maintenance and repair of land systems and produce artillery ammunition, the company announced on Oct. 1. KNDS is one of Europe&apos;s biggest defense companies, formed from a 2015 merger of the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and the French company Nexter Systems. The subsidiary KNDS Ukraine LLC &quot;will support the cooperation between Ukrainian government institutions, the Ukrainian armaments industry, and KNDS,&quot; &#xA0;the press release said. KNDS makes around 800 systems used by or contracted for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including the Caesar artillery gun, the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun tank, and the &#xA0;PzH 2000 armored howitzer. KNDS also intends to jointly manufacture NATO-standard 155 mm artillery ammunition and produce spare parts with the Ukrainian industry. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, the company Ukrainian Defense Industry said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells. Alexander Kamyshin, the former strategic industries minister, announced in early September that Ukraine was already producing its own 155 mm artillery ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/knds-opens-subsidiary-in-ukraine/	2024-10-01T10:38:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158869098.jpg
Foreign Ministry refutes FT report that minister discussed territorial compromises	Ukraine&apos;s new Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha did not discuss territorial compromises with Russia in recent meetings with his Western counterparts, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Oct. 1, refuting a report by the Financial Times (FT) that he had discussed &quot;potential compromise solutions.&quot; &quot;I attended every single meeting of Foreign Minister Sybiha in New York, and no territorial compromises were suggested, discussed, or even hinted at during any of the meetings,&quot; Tykhyi said. &quot;To the contrary, the Minister&#x2019;s position is rock solid and he emphasized it behind closed doors,&quot; Tykhyi said. &quot;There can be no compromise on Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty or territorial integrity.&quot; Tykhyi&apos;s comments referred to an FT article on Oct. 1 that said Sybiha privately discussed potential compromises with Western counterparts during his trip to New York for the U.N. General Assembly last week. The FT cited multiple European diplomats who attended the U.N. General Assembly. The diplomats reportedly noted &quot;more openness from Ukrainian officials to discuss the potential for agreeing a ceasefire even while Russian troops remain on their territory.&quot; Sybiha allegedly &quot;struck a more pragmatic tone on the possibility of land-for-security negotiations&quot; than his predecessor Dmytro Kuleba, the FT said. According to Tykhyi, the information from the FT&apos;s sources is &quot;simply false&quot; and leaves questions regarding &quot;who would be interested in spreading such false narratives.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-refutes-ft-report-that-minister-discussed-compromises/	2024-10-01T09:56:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2170643164.jpg
Ukrainian commanders to be able to directly select volunteer fighters, defense minister announces	Commanders of Ukrainian military units will now be able to directly select soldiers who enlist voluntarily, bypassing the standard process of involving enlistment offices, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Oct. 1. Ukraine is undertaking a campaign to modernize military recruitment, aiming to streamline mobilization, combat corruption, and improve other army processes that have been hampered by Soviet-era practices. Under the new rules, those who enlist voluntarily into specific units can be recruited by commanders without having to go through the enlistment offices, known as territorial recruitment centers. The centers have earned a reputation in Ukraine for malpractice and corruption. The new system will allow for &quot;high-quality recruiting,&quot; Umerov said. Commanders will be able to personally select volunteers, &quot;taking into account their skills, experience, and aspirations.&quot; &quot;For every Ukrainian man and woman, this is a chance to find their place in the ranks of defenders, where their abilities will bring the greatest benefit,&quot; Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/commanders-directly-select-fighters/	2024-10-01T08:53:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Karina-Piliuhina-9.jpg
Two years on, the Nord Stream explosion remains a mystery, deepening European divide	Two years after a series of explosions tore apart Russia&#x2019;s controversial Nord Stream pipelines, the investigation has largely remained a mystery full of accusations that have exposed political fault lines across Europe. Stretching from northwestern Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany&#x2019;s coast, the pipelines completed before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion are a long-standing project that aimed to boost Russian gas flow into Western Europe, symbolic of the old energy pact between Moscow and Berlin that now seems like a mistake. The multifaceted investigation that followed the detonation and subsequent effective destruction of three out of four pipelines in September 2022 has essentially run on two separate tracks: the hard police work of determining who was responsible and the larger rethinking of the strategy to integrate Russia into the West via energy trade. In practice, the two have become intertwined as competing camps have latched on to the continuing mystery of the explosion to pursue their own political agendas. Soon after the explosion, it was quickly determined that it was no accident. Due to the location of the pipelines in international waters, but also within Danish and Swedish maritime economic zones, as well as the involvement of Russia and Germany as the source and end-point of the pipelines, the investigation inherently involved numerous countries. Initially, there was speculation that Russia was responsible for the explosions. Gerhard Schindler, the former head of Germany&#x2019;s national intelligence agency, said days after the underwater explosions that &#x201C;only Russia can really be considered for this, especially since it stands to gain the most from this act of sabotage.&#x201D; In the lead-up to Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine, Germany bowed to pressure and halted the Nord Stream 2 project. Schindler and others in Germany and Western Europe argued at the time that Russia may have destroyed its own pipelines in an act of revenge that would raise gas prices in an attempt to show Europeans the cost of severing economic ties with Russia. At the same time, Russia cast a wide net of accusations, claiming that the U.S., the U.K., or others were responsible. The alleged involvement of the U.S. later was echoed by conspiracy theorists like Seymour Hersh, who claimed, citing unnamed sources, that it was directly ordered by President Joe Biden. The receiving station for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline stands at twilight near Lubmin, Germany on Feb. 2, 2022. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)In March 2023, the New York Times and other media outlets began sharing intelligence that indicated Ukraine might have been responsible. While Ukrainian officials had openly campaigned against the pipelines and referred to them as a security threat that bypassed Ukrainian gas transit pipelines by making European markets more dependent on Russian fuel supplies, they also denied they had anything to do with the attack. U.S. officials said at the time there was no evidence that President Volodymyr Zelensky or anyone in his top circle was involved &#x2014; or that the attackers operated on the orders of the Ukrainian government. The Danish and Swedish investigations concluded in early 2024 without identifying any suspects. The Wall Street Journal wrote in January 2024, citing unnamed German investigators, that the attackers may have operated from Poland, and further claimed that the Polish government was &#x201C;hindering&#x201D; the probe. But intelligence leaks and speculation continued, with an increasing number of fingers being pointed at Ukraine. The most concrete accusations came in August 2024, when the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote, citing unnamed sources, that the explosion was ordered by then Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi and carried out by a team of Ukrainian saboteurs. The WSJ claimed that Zelensky had initially approved the attack, but then changed his mind and asked Zaluzhnyi to call it off. Separate stories by German media outlets that said that Berlin had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor &#x2014; coincidentally identified as Volodymyr Z. &#x2014; only deepened the sense of Kyiv&#x2019;s involvement. Later, Poland said it had received the arrest warrant but that Volodymyr Z had already left the country. Nonetheless, Zaluzhnyi dismissed the allegations as a &#x201C;provocation,&#x201D; and Kyiv continued to deny that it was behind the explosion. As of the time of this publication, there is no concrete answer, but that has not stopped the blame game, which has become imbued with deeper political implications. Across the board, various officials and commentators have used the Nord Stream explosion as a political weapon, tying their accusations to underlying positions on Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war on Ukraine. Those already opposed to Western support for Ukraine have often cited Kyiv&#x2019;s alleged involvement in the attack as yet another reason to end or at least cut aid for the country. In an interview with far-right commentator Tucker Carlson in April 2023, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump insinuated that the U.S. was responsible, echoing past suggestions that it was either Washington &#x2014; or Kyiv &#x2014; but not Russia. Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers remarks to the press at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. on Sep. 26, 2024. (Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s comments on Nord Stream fit in a larger pattern of invoking Ukraine to attack his then-political opponent, Biden. The former president also claimed that he had &#x201C;stopped&#x201D; the pipeline project while in his office and alleged that it was under Biden that it flourished. For Trump and others who repeatedly warn that U.S. support for Ukraine would lead to escalation with Russia, the implication of Ukrainian involvement in the explosion is yet another example. Just days after the explosion was first reported, Trump shared old comments from Biden, in which he said, &#x201C;If Russia invades&#x2026;then there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2. We will put a stop to it.&#x201D; Trump added: &#x201C;Wow, what a statement. World War III, anyone?&#x201D; Among European countries that support Ukraine, the pipeline explosion has also been used as a rhetorical tool, but for another purpose &#x2014; to castigate Germany for leading the charge in cementing the EU&#x2019;s dependence on Russian energy in the first place. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk made waves in August 2024 when he responded to the suggestion of Warsaw&#x2019;s involvement by saying, &#x201C;To all the initiators and patrons of Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2. The only thing you should do today about it is apologize and keep quiet.&#x201D; While he did not mention anyone by name, it was clear he was referring to Germany, the main &#x201C;patron&#x201D; of the project. Czech President Petr Pavel went even further, saying that even if Ukraine was behind the attack, the pipeline would have been &#x201C;a legitimate goal&#x201D; for Kyiv to try and cut energy revenues flowing back to Moscow. German allegations that Poland may have been involved were &#x201C;inspired by Moscow&quot; with the aim of destabilizing NATO, said Krzysztof Gawkowski, a deputy Polish prime minister and the minister of digital affairs. Critics of the pipeline, which included many in central and eastern Europe, had long argued that Germany was misguided in going forward with the project.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Beyond eliminating potential profits that an overland pipeline could give Poland and other countries, Nord Stream deepened the EU&#x2019;s dependence on Russian energy and raised fears long before the full-scale war that Moscow would use such reliance as a tool to exert pressure. When Russia did just that after February 2022 &#x2014; threatening to cut off energy supplies to the EU in response to its support for Ukraine, there was a sense of vindication from those who had long warned of the threat of energy dependence. The bloc&#x2019;s response to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, in which Poland, Czechia, the Baltic states, and other countries previously thought to be on the periphery of the center of power in Brussels have emerged to be most committed to its defense from Russia, have fueled the argument that Germany&#x2019;s policy was a failure.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-years-on-the-nord-stream-explosion-remains-a-mystery-but-it-has-revealed-fissures-in-europe/	2024-10-01T07:48:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1243544531.jpg
Ukraine names pro-Russian collaborators suspected of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children	Several Russia-installed proxy officials in occupied Donetsk Oblast have been declared suspected of forcibly deporting 31 Ukrainian children to Russia, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Oct. 1. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office named Denys Pushylin, the Russia-installed proxy head of Donetsk Oblast, and two of his officials, Eleanora Fedorenko and Svitlana Maiboroda, as suspects in the case. Maiboroda was identified by the Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigations Unit in their documentary &quot;Uprooted.&quot; The team passed on the evidence collected during the making of the film to the prosecutors. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office expressed gratitude to Ukrainian investigative journalists, including the Kyiv Independent, who conducted investigations into the case and passed on their materials. Russian authorities and their collaborators have illegally deported thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories to Russia and placed them in foster families, where they are raised as Russians. This particular case concerns the deportation of 19 orphans from Mariupol and nine children from the cities of Shakhtarsk and Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Another three children from Mariupol were taken away from their father at a filtration camp. The suspects facilitated the deportation of the children, the youngest of whom was six years old at the time, from Ukraine. The transfer of the children &quot;did not meet the requirements of international humanitarian law, as it was not justified by security or health reasons,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office noted. According to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, the children were first taken by bus to Rostov-on-Don and later taken by plane to Moscow. &#xA0; Ukrainian investigators found that the plane used to organize the flight belongs to a particular unit that is subordinate to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s administration. Despite being Ukrainian, the children were issued Russian passports and given to Russian adoptive families. Among the group was a 17-year-old from Mariupol who was effectively adopted by Maria Lvova-Belova, Putin&apos;s Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights and the Kremlin official who allegedly oversees the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The three children from Mariupol managed to reunite with their father on their own, while three teenagers were returned to Ukraine by the Ukrainian authorities. The other 25 children remain in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-officials-suspected-of-forcibly-deporting-children/	2024-10-01T07:19:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1240568267.jpg
Biden may advance Ukraine's NATO membership bid status, FT reports	U.S. President Joe Biden may agree to advance the status of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership bid before leaving office in January, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 1, citing an unnamed Western official. The FT&apos;s source briefed on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent trip to the U.S. did not provide further details. Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Biden previously said that peace in Ukraine means a guarantee that Russia will never occupy the country again, but Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO is not necessary for this. Later in June, Zelensky and the U.S. president signed a security agreement between the two nations, which was described as a &quot;bridge&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s future NATO membership. However, the deal did not outline new prospects for Kyiv to join the alliance. The July NATO summit in Washington ended with the launch of the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allies. The countries affirmed Kyiv&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, though Ukraine did not receive any definitive news about its future accession. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-may-advance-ukraines-nato-membership-bid-status-ft-reports/	2024-10-01T06:03:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173752349.jpg
Russia's Crimean Bridge defenses are reportedly washing up on shore	Barriers put in place to protect the Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian attacks have been washed ashore after a recent storm, it was reported on Sept. 30. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, plastic and metal barrels connected by metal frames were spotted littering the beach in Kerch on the occupied peninsula. &quot;The local population dismantles them and takes away the metal, and the plastic barrels remain on the beach,&quot; it added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but Russia has taken steps in recent weeks to bolster the defenses of the Crimean Bridge. Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk on Sept. 26 said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the structure, but added deteriorating weather conditions as winter approaches would make it difficult to complete. &quot;They are constantly trying to place something new in the Kerch Strait, to build various hydrotechnical or barrier structures. But periodically they end up on the shore after another storm,&quot; he said. A day later it was reported Russia was attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-crimean-bridge-defenses-are-reportedly-washing-up-on-shore/	2024-10-01T05:46:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-01-15_40_16.jpeg
Russia attempts to capture new positions in Zaporizhzhia sector, preparing small-scale assaults, military says	Russian troops are trying to seize new positions in the Zaporizhzhia sector to improve their tactical position, Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 1. Voloshyn said there were indications that Russian forces were gathering troops near the towns of Pryiutne and Robotyne in order to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;There are certain signs that (the enemy) is taking such steps: concentrating personnel and moving them to the frontline, training these assault groups, accumulating ammunition,&quot; he said. Following Kyiv&apos;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russia reportedly began moving its troops from Ukraine&apos;s south and east to the Russian region, but Voloshyn said the number of troops in the Zaporizhzhia sector remained the around the same. Russia has only redeployed certain units and specialists to the Kursk direction and is increasing the number of personnel by 2,000-3,000 soldiers per week to replenish losses, Voloshyn said. &quot;This is not a build-up and increase of forces and means,&quot; he said. According to Voloshyn, Russia does not have enough troops to launch a large-scale offensive. &quot;No such groups have been spotted so far. Therefore, we can only say that the enemy is preparing for (smaller) assaults,&quot; Voloshyn said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaporizhzhia-sector-assaults/	2024-10-01T05:22:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1733436357.jpg
Germany's Scholz hoping for phone call with Putin, Zeit reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is hoping to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone for the first time in almost two years, the German newspaper Zeit reported on Oct. 1. Citing sources in &quot;government circles,&quot; the outlet said an official request to the Kremlin has not yet been made, but Berlin plans to make it happen in the run-up to the G20 meeting in Brazil in November. Zeit did not report what Scholz plans to discuss with Putin. Scholz last spoke with Putin in December 2022, the same year the leaders of the U.S., France, and the U.K. last had direct contact. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. On Sept. 4, Scholz said that Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. By 2026, Ukraine should receive 24 IRIS-T systems from Germany &#x2014; 12 of medium-range versions and 12 short-range. But amid ongoing discussions among Ukraine&apos;s Western allies about using their weapons to strike deep inside Russia, Scholz continues to insist Berlin will not grant Kyiv permission to use its Taurus missiles to do so. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Scholz on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Shortly before the meeting, Scholz reaffirmed Berlin&apos;s refusal to allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets within Russia. &quot;Germany will not lift any restrictions,&quot; Scholz said in response to queries from reporters regarding long-range strikes in Russia. &quot;This does not depend on my personal attitude. We will not do that, and we have good reasons for that.&quot; Scholz said his position would not change even if the U.S. lifts restrictions, and said that Germany aims to &quot;focus on what really helps and what is needed&quot; in terms of supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-scholz-hoping-for-phone-call-with-putin-zeit-reports/	2024-10-01T04:37:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Ukraine top of the agenda as Mark Rutte takes up NATO general secretary role	NATO has to ensure that Ukraine &quot;prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation,&quot; Mark Rutte said on Oct. 1, as he took the helm as the new secretary general of the military alliance. Speaking alongside the outgoing Jens Stoltenberg during a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Rutte praised his predecessor&apos;s achievements during his tenure. &quot;You&#x2019;ve already mentioned the priorities you&#x2019;ve been working on and these priorities we&#x2019;ll take forward in the future &#x2014; Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to make sure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation.&quot; Rutte added that NATO members have to &quot;spend more&quot; in order to &quot;increase our collective defense,&quot; adding: &quot;NATO&#x2019;s partnerships&#x2026; have to go wider, and deeper, given all the insecurities in the world.&quot; Answering questions from reporters, Rutte also addressed the upcoming U.S. presidential election, diplomatically addressing both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. &quot;I know both candidates very well. I worked for four years with Donald Trump. He was pushing us to spend more, and he achieved it &#x2014; at the moment we are at a much higher spending level,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;He was also pushing us off China, and he was right. &quot;Of course, Kamala Harris has a fantastic record as vice president, she is a highly respected figure. So, I hope, I will be able to work with both.&quot; Ukraine is still hoping to join NATO, and an invitation is part of Kyiv&apos;s victory plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 24. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022, half a year into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The July NATO summit in Washington ended with the launch of the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allies. The countries affirmed Kyiv&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, though Ukraine did not receive any definitive news about its future accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-top-of-the-agenda-as-mark-rutte-takes-up-nato-general-secretary-role/	2024-10-01T03:42:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175229416.jpg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia kills 1 person, injures 6	Russian forces attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia on Oct. 1, killing one person and injuring at least six others, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russia launched at least six guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia, damaging apartment buildings and houses. The city&apos;s infrastructure facilities were also hit, Fedorov said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure. A guided aerial bomb was used to target the city for the first time on Sept. 23. Overnight on Sept. 29, Russia&apos;s strike against the city injured 16 people, including an eight-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, according to local authorities. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-kills/	2024-10-01T03:14:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-01_12-49-55.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Why doesn’t Ukraine have a national military cemetery?	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Sept. 28, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Vira Lytvynenko hasn&#x2019;t been able to bury her son since March 2022, when he was killed defending Ukraine against a Russian offensive near the Mariupol Drama Theater. Instead, she keeps his ashes at home. Even in the third year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, and over 10 years since the war began, Ukraine still does not have a national military cemetery. Many veterans and their families fear this neglect reflects a lack of respect for those who sacrificed their lives. It&#x2019;s as if there were no Arlington National Cemetery in the United States &#x2013; a sacred space for remembrance and a powerful symbol of national gratitude. Ukrainians yearn for a similar space to honor their soldiers. &#x201C;The state should have provided the best possible honoring of its fallen&#x2026; there are certain sacred and infallible things in society. Civilian cemeteries are already running out of space,&#x201D; said Taras Ishchyk, who is serving in the Ukrainian military. Instead of transparently constructing a national memorial cemetery, the authorities have dragged out the selection of a site, proposing locations far from Kyiv. The design and tendering process is marred by scandals and corruption, which critics say further diminishes the significance of soldiers&apos; sacrifices. Vladyslav Lytvynenko, Vira&#x2019;s son, was a soldier with Ukraine&#x2019;s Azov Brigade. He hailed from Donetsk Oblast and lived in Mariupol until 2014 when Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region and annexation of Crimea forced his family to move to Kyiv. In 2015, Vladyslav returned to Mariupol and joined Azov, where he fought in several battles. &#x201C;In 2022, he (Vladyslav) was supposed to leave the army and start a civilian life, because he hadn&#x2019;t experienced it as an adult, having been fighting since he was 20,&#x201D; Vira said, her eyes slowly filling with tears. Vira is just one among many families waiting to honor their fallen. According to Olena Tolkachova, the head of the Azov Patronage Service, which cares for the brigade&#x2019;s soldiers and families, the service has been advocating for a national military cemetery since 2014. &#x201C;We have a family who is so hopeful for this particular (military) cemetery that they did not take the body out (of the morgue),&#x201D; Tolkachova said. &#x201C;And they are already in such a very depressed state because the cemetery has not been built in two years.&#x201D; But despite the urgency, there has been little progress. Local regions have been left to bury their soldiers within existing cemeteries, where graves often blend in with civilian ones. It wasn&#x2019;t until May 2022 that a law was passed to simplify the land and construction procedures for the national cemetery. The Kyiv city administration designated a site near Bykivnia forest, a burial ground for victims of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s repressions. In August 2023, however, the government abruptly changed the site. The new location is over 20 kilometers from Kyiv&apos;s center, frustrating families like Vira&apos;s, who must now endure a two-hour commute to visit their loved ones. The cemetery, initially envisioned as a place easily accessible to the public to honor Ukraine&#x2019;s sacrifices, now risks obscurity due to its distance. Some families have already buried their relatives locally, tired of waiting. Others, like Vira, continue to hold out hope.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)In the summer of 2023, Serhii Derbin was selected as the project&#x2019;s architect, though there was no open competition for the large-scale national project. A tender was posted in the electronic public procurement system, but only one person allegedly applied. &quot;No one even knew about the design tender,&quot; said Dartsia Verytiuk, the creator of the Pantheon of Heroes concept in Ternopil. In response, Derbin told The Counteroffensive that the tender was officially announced on the website, available to anyone who wished to participate. By the end of 2023, families were still unable to bury their fallen soldiers. The cemetery&#x2019;s design wasn&#x2019;t presented until December 2023, alongside new legislation to create the site. The current design has been criticized for combining mismatched architectural elements, resembling both a supermarket and an ancient temple. Verytiuk, who had made suggestions for the memorial, said, &quot;None of our comments were accepted, and the project wasn&#x2019;t changed at all. It became clear everything had been decided long ago.&quot; However, Derbin claimed that most professional feedback had been incorporated and that all decisions were balanced and well-considered. In July 2024, a tender for the cemetery&#x2019;s construction was announced. Only one consortium, Building UA, formed the day after the tender was posted, applied for the $44 million (1.8 billion hryvnias) project. Critics were baffled by the government&apos;s preference for granite over lighter materials for the gravestones. As journalist Dariia Hirna explained, lighter-colored sandstone would evoke peace and tranquility, while gray or black granite could create an atmosphere of sadness. One of the companies that won the tender was Akam, a granite producer from Dnipro. Akam belongs to a group of companies owned by Vadym Yermolaiev, who was sanctioned by President Zelensky in 2023 for conducting business in Russian-occupied territories. Yermolaiev&#x2019;s whereabouts are unknown, and The Counteroffensive could not reach him for comment. Construction at the cemetery has since been halted. In September, the Security Bureau of Ukraine (SBU) confirmed that Akam was part of Yermolaiev&apos;s sanctioned group of companies. &quot;This is a crime against the families of fallen soldiers and those still serving. Both tenders should be canceled, and an open international competition should be held instead,&quot; said serviceman Ishchyk. This means that even this year, Ukraine&#x2019;s fallen defenders will not find peace at a national cemetery, and their families will still have no place to honor them. That includes Vira Lytvynenko, whose son gave his life for Ukraine&#x2019;s independence.

Russian forces enter Vuhledar, situation 'extremely difficult,' governor says	Russian troops have entered the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 1, adding that fighting is ongoing. Speaking on national television, Filashkin described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult,&quot; adding: &quot;The enemy has already almost reached the center of the town.&quot; &quot;The fighting is going on within the town, so it is almost impossible to bring in humanitarian aid.&quot; A total of 107 civilians remain in Vuhledar, though all children have been evacuated, he added. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. On Sept. 26, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating and released a video from the town. According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState on Oct. 1, Russian soldiers entered Vuhledar from the west and south. In recent days, Russian forces advanced northeast of Vuhledar and on the western outskirts of the town, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Sept. 30, citing geolocated footage. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;Potentially (its loss could) threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier in September. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Borsari said. Given the Russian significant advance towards Pokrovsk from the east in recent weeks, Ukrainian forces need to avoid a similar development from the south to avoid the risk of encirclement, Borsari added. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward.	https://kyivindependent.com/vuhledar/	2024-10-01T02:05:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1785368869.jpg
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 'on verge of blackout' after Russian attack on substation, Ukraine says	Russian forces attacked a substation connected to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), cutting off a power line to the facility, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on Oct. 1. The attack put the plant &quot;on the verge&quot; of a blackout again, the ministry said in a statement, adding work was underway to restore full power. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. &quot;We demand to immediately implement the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) resolution and return the occupied nuclear power plant under Ukraine&apos;s control. The safe operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP is possible only under Ukraine&apos;s control,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The plant has already experienced eight complete blackouts, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. He did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-substation-cuts-off-power-line-to-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-kyiv-says/	2024-10-01T01:29:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240274985.jpg
Ukraine's defense minister requests dismissal of 3 deputies, state secretary	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed a submission to Ukraine&apos;s government on the dismissal of three of his deputies and the state secretary, he announced on Oct. 1. Umerov called the system of the Defense Ministry, including the Armed Forces, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), and State Transport Special Service &#xA0;&quot;a closed perimeter&quot; during martial law. &quot;This means that all processes inside must be clear and controlled. Any attempt to influence them, whether external or internal, is unacceptable. In this context, personnel changes are taking place,&quot; Umerov said in a post on Facebook, without elaborating on the reason for the reshuffle. Umerov&apos;s deputies Oleksandr Serhii, Yurii Dzhygyr as well as Defense Ministry&apos;s State Secretary Liudmyla Darahan were requested to be dismissed. Another Deputy Defense Minister Stanislav Haider is going to be transferred to the position of the head of the Minister&apos;s Office. It is now up to Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet to approve the dismissals. It was not announced who would replace them, if approved. Umerov is also planning to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense acquisition system, he said. Supervisory boards are to be set up for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) &quot;in the near future,&quot; the minister said. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid like food and clothing. In addition, &quot;Spetstechnoexport&quot; (STE), Ukrainian state foreign trade enterprise, is being transferred from HUR to the Defense Ministry. The STE specializes in the export and import of military equipment and services, development of innovations, and establishment of defense-technical cooperation with Western countries and foreign companies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-minister-requests/	2024-10-01T00:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp

A real myth' — Trump's Ukraine peace plan rubbished by former national security advisor	A former national security advisor to Donald Trump has rubbished the Republican presidential candidate&apos;s claims that he will be able to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and end the war in Ukraine. Speaking to CBS&#x2019;s Face the Nation on Sept. 29, HR McMaster dismissed his former boss&apos;s claims as &quot;a real myth,&quot; adding: &quot;It&#x2019;s a real misunderstanding of war &#x2014; to assume that you can get a favorable political outcome without a favorable military outcome. &quot;That&#x2019;s never really happened in war.&quot; Trump has promised to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine within a day if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. One plan reportedly involves ceding territory to Russia. Even the Kremlin has voiced skepticism of Trump&apos;s claims, saying on July 18 there was a need to &quot;be realistic.&quot; &quot;I don&#x2019;t really buy it,&quot; McMaster said, adding the only way that Ukraine can end up with &quot;a favorable settlement&quot; is to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in a situation where he is convinced that he is losing the war. &quot;How do you do that? You demonstrate our resolve to continue to support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this continued onslaught by the Russians,&quot; McMaster said. &quot;That&#x2019;s how you get to &#x2014; maybe &#x2014; favorable conditions for negotiation.&quot; In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Trump should reveal his plan so Kyiv can be prepared for any risks such a plan might entail. &quot;If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg Television in an interview published on July 3. &quot;If there are risks to Ukrainian independence, if we lose statehood &#x2014; we want to be ready for this, we want to know... We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S., or will be all alone.&quot; Trump and Zelensky met in the U.S. last week where the presidential candidate said that he had &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become increasingly critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Trump also criticized Zelensky earlier in September for refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and accused him of &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; toward him. But in an interview with The Washington Post published on Sept. 30, Trump said that he &quot;likes&quot; Zelensky and that he &quot;had a good relationship&quot; with him while in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-real-myth-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-rubbished-by-former-national-security-advisor/	2024-09-30T23:46:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-871121864.jpg
Ukraine doesn't need US permission to strike back at Russia with homemade weapons, State Department says	Ukraine can use domestically-produced weapons to hit targets inside Russia, and does not need U.S. permission to do so, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing on Sept. 30. Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. In turn, Ukraine has carried out successful attacks on targets inside Russia with homemade arms, namely long-range drones. Over the past year, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said last month. According to Miller, Kyiv can use &quot;many&quot; domestically-made weapons, and has &quot;an enormous amount of material to defend itself.&quot; Ukraine is also hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last month ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. When asked why Washington could not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike back, the spokesperson said that the White House considers all capabilities, tactics and support for Ukraine comprehensively. &quot;When we approve any new weapon system or any new tactic, we look at how it&#x2019;s going to affect the entire battlefield and Ukraine&#x2019;s entire strategy. &#xA0;And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll continue to do,&quot; he added. &quot;And if you look at the weapons we&apos;ve provided them, we&apos;ve made it very clear that they can use them to retaliate against Russian targets across the border that are conducting attacks. &quot;We are always looking to see if there are additional tools we can provide them.&quot; In late August, Umerov submitted to senior U.S. officials a list of targets that Ukraine wants to hit with U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles in Russia, which included airfields used by the Russian army to launch strikes against population centers across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-does-not-need-us-permission-to-strike-back-at-russia-has-homemade-arms-mill/	2024-09-30T23:20:59-07:00	https://kyivindependent-01.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1257319595.jpg
Ukraine faces 'very challenging' situation on front lines, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine faces a &quot;very challenging&quot; situation on the front lines, adding that &quot;everything that can be done this fall, everything we can achieve, we must achieve.&quot; Speaking during his daily address on Sept. 30, Zelensky said he had held more than two-and-a-half hours of talks with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and Chief of the General Staff Anatolii Barhylevych that day. &quot;The situation is very challenging,&quot; Zelensky said, adding: &quot;The most important thing is to put pressure on Russia using all available means and tools to achieve our goal of a real and just peace for Ukraine and all our people as soon as possible.&quot; Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. &quot;These are such signs of preparation for the fact that in the near future, assault actions will be carried out in the Zaporizhzhia direction,&quot; Voloshyn said, though stressing that it would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive. The spokesman suggested that the potential operation may be Russia&apos;s attempt at improving its tactical position in the area, but &#x201C;there is no talk of an offensive yet.&#x201D; The village of Pryiutne lies about 40 kilometers west of Vuhledar, a mining town that Russian troops have been trying to seize for more than two years. Russia has scaled up its offensive on Vuhledar in August, slowly gaining ground to encircle the town. The defense of Vuhledar is strategic as capturing the town would allow Moscow to form the southern flank, which is needed as a staging ground for a bigger push onto Pokrovsk &#x2013; a crucial Ukrainian-controlled logistic hub in the Donbas. Zelensky highlighted the upcoming leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany in October as being critical for the future course of the war. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. &quot;This will be a special Ramstein,&quot; Zelensky said, adding: &quot;And our partners will receive all the details and arguments from our side on how to ensure results in the coming months both at the front and in diplomatic work. &quot;The power of weapons and the power of diplomacy are always effective when working together, and this is exactly our plan &#x2014; this is exactly how we should implement the victory plan. &quot;We are also expecting concrete actions from our partners to strengthen our strategy. This applies to all our partners &#x2014; our strength lies in the fact that the free world is defending itself.&quot; Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-faces-very-challenging-situation-on-front-lines-zelensky-says/	2024-09-30T22:55:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173844192.jpg

Reversing recent rhetoric, Trump says he 'likes' Zelensky	Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post published on Sept. 30 that he &quot;likes&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky and that he &quot;had a good relationship&quot; with him while in office. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become more critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Trump also criticized Zelensky earlier in September for refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and accused him of &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; toward him. But following the in-person meeting between the two in New York City on Sept. 27, Trump appears to have reversed course &#x2014; at least temporarily &#x2014; as he praised Zelensky for allegedly not helping investigators with the probe that led to Trump&apos;s first impeachment trial in 2019. Repeating similar comments made at a joint press conference in advance of their meeting, Trump told the Washington Post that he liked Zelensky &quot;because during the impeachment hoax&#x2026;he could have said he didn&apos;t know the (conversation) was taped&#x2026;But instead of grandstanding and saying, &apos;Yes, I felt threatened,&apos; he said, &apos;He did absolutely nothing wrong.&apos;&quot; The impeachment trial was centered around a phone call between the two in 2019 in which Trump was accused of withholding military aid as a means of pressuring Zelensky to investigate President Joe Biden&apos;s son Hunter Biden. At the time, Zelensky said the phone call was &quot;normal.&quot; Later, as the investigation gathered steam, Zelensky said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t want to be involved&quot; in U.S. elections. Trump has similarly thanked Zelensky in the past for keeping his distance from the impeachment investigation. The Washington Post also asked Trump for clarification on comments he had made in July 2023, in which he claimed that he would give Ukraine &quot;more than they ever got&quot; if Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Trump&apos;s peace deal. &quot;I did say that, so I can say it to you. But I did say that and nobody picked it up. They don&apos;t because it makes so much sense,&quot; Trump responded, apparently without elaborating further. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he would end the war within 24 hours if elected but has declined to specify exactly how he plans to do so. After his recent meeting with Zelensky, Trump said that he had &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed.	https://kyivindependent.com/reversing-recent-rhetoric-trump-says-he-likes-zelensky/	2024-09-30T20:23:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Russia plans more than 25% increase of funding for Putin, presidential administration	Russia is planning a 25.6% increase in its funding for President Vladimir Putin and his presidential administration, according to a draft budget for 2025 published on Sept. 30. Expenses for Putin and the presidential administration will increase to 30.9 billion rubles ($332 million). The bulk of the expenses &#x2014; 21 billion rubles ($235 million) are earmarked for an increase in salaries for the president and his staff. Other expenses will be directed toward purchasing goods for Putin and the staff of the administration, which numbers some 2,000 people. With no immediate end to the full-scale war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will also increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. The figure will further drop in 2025, with 6.49 trillion rubles ($69 billion) allocated for social spending in 2025, accounting for 15.7% of total expenses. Economists have predicted that Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that have historically backed growth. In February 2024, U.S. intelligence estimated that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on military operations in Ukraine. The war has also cost Russia up to $1.3 trillion in lost economic growth through 2026, an undisclosed source in U.S. intelligence told Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-30-boost-in-defense-spending-25-increase-for-putin-presidential-administration/	2024-09-30T19:07:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg
Russia sentences man to life in prison for car bomb attack that wounded pro-war writer	A court in Moscow sentenced a man to life in prison on Sept. 30 for a car bomb attack in May 2023 that seriously wounded Russian pro-war writer and former fighter Zakhar Prilepin. Russian state-run media have claimed that the convict Alexander Permyakov has both Ukrainian and Russian citizenship and further alleged that he acted on behalf of Kyiv &#x2014; with the support of the U.S. Prilepin was sanctioned in 2022 by Ukraine, the EU, the U.K., and Canada for supporting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He joined Russia&apos;s National Guard to fight against Ukraine in January 2023, according to several Russian media reports. Previously, Prilepin fought with Russian proxy fighters in Donetsk Oblast between 2016 and 2018 and regularly speaks out in favor of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The car bomb attack occurred in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod and resulted in both of Prilepin&apos;s legs being broken, among other injuries. It also killed Prilepin&apos;s driver. Russian state-run media claimed that Permyakov confessed to the attack after his arrest, and alleged that he had been recruited by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and promised $20,000 as payment. The SBU has not confirmed or denied its involvement in the attack, but the Atesh partisan group claimed responsibility for carrying it out. There is no way to independently verify the validity of Permyakov&apos;s alleged confession. Russia does not provide transparent access to its legal system, and international human rights organizations have long detailed rampant abuse in prisons, as well as the use of torture to coerce confessions. A number of Russian propagandists, proxy officials, and other pro-war figures have been targeted for alleged assassinations, some of which have been successful, in both occupied territories of Ukraine and in Russia itself. In April 2023, an explosion in a cafe in downtown St. Petersburg killed Russian propagandist Vladlen Tatarsky and injured a dozen others.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sentences-man-to-life-in-prison-for-car-bomb-attack-that-wounded-pro-war-writer/	2024-09-30T17:57:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-933568448.jpg
Jamala's documentary honored with Gold Dolphin at Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards	The Ukrainian documentary &quot;Jamala. Songs of Freedom&quot; won the Gold Dolphin at the Cannes Corporate Media &amp; TV Awards, in the Human Concerns and Social Issues category. &quot;I&apos;m reading this and I can&apos;t believe it... Out of almost 800 applications from 46 countries, the Cannes jury selected this particular film,&quot; Jamala posted on Facebook. The documentary focuses on her work and support for Ukraine at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This film is about us... about these three years of losses, pain, suffering, and our desperate fight for freedom,&quot; Jamala said. The singer previously gained international recognition by winning the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest with her song 1944, about the deportation of Crimean Tatars. Her family, like that of Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, was deported to Central Asia in 1944 by the Soviet authorities on the false accusation that all Crimean Tatars had collaborated with the Nazis. Up to 200,000 Crimean Tatars &#x2013; mostly women, children, and the elderly &#x2013; were deported to Central Asia and Siberia, while Crimean Tatar men who were fighting for the Red Army at the time were sent to labor camps.In the 1980s, Jamala and her family returned to Crimea, where she went on to study in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/jamalas-documentary-honored-with-gold-dolphin-at-cannes-corporate-media-tv-awards/	2024-09-30T16:09:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Jamala.jpg
Lithuania urges ICC probe into crimes of Lukashenko regime	Lithuania has formally requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the regime of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. This appeal focuses on offenses primarily carried out since May 2020, when the Lukashenko regime started to increasingly target civilians through deportation and persecute political opponents. Lithuania&apos;s Ministry of Justice asserts that these actions represent a systematic attack on dissent in Belarus, aligned with state policy. &quot;The request for justice - emanating from the victims themselves - must not go unanswered,&quot; said Aarif Abraham, Counsel to the Lithuanian Government before the ICC. One specific charge is the forced relocation of thousands of Belarusian citizens to neighboring countries, including Lithuania. Despite Belarus not being a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction due to crimes committed on the territories of participating nations. Lithuania, which previously succeeded in bringing charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin, now seeks an arrest warrant for Lukashenko. Unrest in Belarus began in 2020 after contested presidential elections, with widespread protests and international sanctions following Lukashenko&#x2019;s disputed re-election. When an upswell of support made it obvious that opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was heading for victory, Lukashenko falsified the results, awarding himself over 80% of the vote. More than 1,000 political prisoners have been given decade-plus prison sentences, and 1,500 others have been jailed for protesting against the war in Ukraine, including by sabotaging railroads to impede the Russian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-urges-icc-probe-into-crimes-of-lukashenko-regime/	2024-09-30T14:33:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Russia plans to start exporting coal from occupied Donbas in October, proxy leader claims	The Russian company Donskoy Ugol Trading House is planning to start exporting coal from the occupied Donbas region through the port of Mariupol in October, the Russian state-controlled media outlet RBC reported on Sept. 30, citing Andey Chertkov, a Russian proxy leader operating in occupied Donetsk Oblast. Russia has occupied Crimea and part of the eastern Donbas region since the start of its aggression in 2014. The city of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people could have been killed. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher. Donskoy Ugol Trading House&apos;s CEO, Oleg Knyazev, claimed that negotiations on coal supplies from the Donbas region are ongoing with potential buyers from China, India, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Malaysia. Exports could pass through the ports of Russian-occupied Mariupol, Russian cities Taganrog and Rostov-on-Don, and by rail through Azerbaijan and Iran, RBC said, citing its undisclosed source familiar with the company&apos;s plans. Donskoy Ugol Trading House was founded in 2020 in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. From 2020 to 2023, Vitaliy Donchenko and Aleksandr Maslyuk owned the company. They were sanctioned by Ukraine in 2021. In 2024, Donskoy Ugol Trading House leased 10 coal mines from Russian proxies in Luhansk Oblast. Some of these mines previously belonged to the Ukrainian metallurgical company Metinvest, controlled by Ukraine&apos;s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-start-exporting-coal-from-occupied-donbas-in-october-proxy-leader-claims/	2024-09-30T13:35:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/coal.jpg
The most downloaded book summary app is from Ukraine, and it wants to change how you read	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Anton Pavlovsky loved reading growing up, but going through the last turbulent 30 or so years of Ukraine&#x2019;s independent history &#x2014; the difficult 90s, the 2004 Orange Revolution then the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, war, and economic difficulties &#x2014; he virtually stopped reading. But after going through a divorce, he found books to be a source of solace. &#x201C;My divorce propelled me into this mode of reflection over what went wrong, what happened and why, and I started reading a lot,&#x201D; founde and CEO Pavlovsky told the Kyiv Independent. While reading he stumbled across a question that particularly affected him &#x2014; &#x201C;What would you do with your life if you were guaranteed success and happiness?&#x201D; Pavlovsky answered the question to himself in the notes app on his computer that he still has from the day he wrote it on Dec. 17, 2018: &quot;I would work on a platform that allowed individuals to educate themselves, educate others, be a role model. A platform that will spread enlightenment.&quot; Three weeks later, the Headway book summary app was born. The app now has a collection of over 1,500 books in English, condensed and summarized with key points that take anywhere from a few minutes to 15 minutes to read or listen to. The company is already working on including Spanish and French books to its repertoire. Since its inception, the app has gone on to become the most downloaded book summary apps in application stores, with around 40 million downloads. The company has also developed four other micro-learning products with a fifth in development, including its &#x201C;brain training&#x201D; app, Impulse, which has been downloaded around 70 million times since 2018. It has also been featured on several ratings and lists as a future unicorn in Ukraine. &#xA0; Headway was founded and to this day operates out of its Kyiv office located in the historic, industrial Podil neighborhood, home to both IT companies and techno clubs. The company relocated many employees out of Kyiv at the onset of the full-scale invasion, but most have since returned. The company has grown 100 times since it was founded, and now counts over 300 employees, a large part of which works in Ukraine. Headway Team in 2022 in an unknown location. (Headway)Pavlovsky told the Kyiv Independent that concentrating books into shorter versions of themselves and offering their highlights isn&#x2019;t about getting people to read less, but more. If people aren&#x2019;t reading anyway &#xA0;&#x2014; in 2023, 46% of adults in the U.S., Headway&#x2019;s largest market, surveyed said they had finished zero books &#x2014; might as well give them some way of interacting with the written word, the thinking goes. &#x201C;Books are great, I love books, but other people may not love them and that&#x2019;s fine, we will provide them with other means to learn in this age of distraction, on the go, gamified, whenever they have like two, five, 10 minutes to spare.&#x201D; The Headway app tries to get people to learn with a variety of options for the busiest of us who can&#x2019;t find more than a few minutes to spare to those who have at least 15 minutes to get away from all of life&#x2019;s daily distractions. One may also want to brush up on a book they read 10 years ago, or see if a book is interesting enough to actually buy it. The app&#x2019;s homepage offers &#x201C;daily microlearning sessions,&#x201D; that allows to &#x201C;tap through 10 bits of knowledge in three minutes.&#x201D; Each bit of knowledge is one line from books ranging in topics from spirituality to how to transform your business and become a seven-figure entrepreneur.

The app also gamifies the experience &#x2014; a part of making interacting with it goal-oriented that seeks to make engaging with the content more fun and, ultimately, wanting you coming back for more. The app tracks your progress and sends you notifications to remind you to keep up the good work. An illustration of the Headway app (Headway)Getting the attention of a population that according to one study has an average attention span of eight seconds &#x2014; one second less than that of a goldfish &#x2014; is one of the goals of companies like Headway. &#xA0; &#x201C;All this distraction and not enough time &#x2014; you have to keep up with so much, the need is there,&#x201D; Pavlovksy said. So is the potential. The global education market is currently valued at $6 trillion and is expected to hit $8 trillion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley Research from 2023. The sector is notorious for being under-digitalized, and according to Pavlovsky, especially when it comes to our phones. Constantly in our hands, Headway and others like it want us to &#x201C;better utilize the capabilities of that kind of device that&#x2019;s always with you,&#x201D; Pavlovsky said. It&#x2019;s also about democratizing access to information &#x2014; many people around the world don&#x2019;t have access to top-level education, but most of them have phones. The market opportunities may mostly be outside of Ukraine, but Headway, being founded and located in Ukraine, the country, and its struggles are never too far away. For one, the app&#x2019;s icon features the blue and yellow of Ukraine&#x2019;s flag. After the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, it launched its &#x201C;Essence of Ukraine&#x201D; series which offers free-of-charge summaries of books about Ukraine and its history. But simply by being such a successful example of a Ukrainian-born and based company, Headway is also changing the persisting negative stereotypes of Ukrainian business as behind or corrupt. &#x201C;I&apos;m sure that Ukraine will prove to the world and it has already proven that it can create number one products, winning products, winning businesses at some point even new business models,&#x201D; Pavlovsky said. Headway redefines learning with bite-sized book summaries, making self-improvement more accessible than ever.

Far-right Freedom Party wins Austrian elections, further cementing Russia-friendly wall in Central Europe	Austrians went to the polls on Sept. 29, handing the victory to the far-right, anti-migration Freedom Party (FPO). The party gained 29% of the vote, its best result to date. Founded by SS Major General Anton Reinthaller in 1956, the party has long been climbing into the country&apos;s mainstream, taking part in three right-wing governments as a junior coalition partner, most recently in 2017. Under the current leadership of Herbert Kickl, a controversial figure in Austrian politics, the party supported lifting sanctions imposed against Russia. Kickl has also repeatedly spoken against providing Ukraine with military aid, arguing that Austria&apos;s policy of neutrality should be preserved. Kickl said he was willing to seek chancellorship, and would serve as a &quot;Volkskanzler&quot; or &quot;Chancellor of the People&quot; &#x2013; a term used in Nazi German to refer to Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. The results mark the latest win for the far-right, Kremlin-friendly parties in Central Europe. The Austrian election came just weeks after Ukraine-skeptic parties made gains in state elections in eastern Germany and a year after Robert Fico won Slovakia&apos;s election on an anti-Ukraine, populist platform. As the election results became clear, the FPO&apos;s victory was lauded by the far-right across the continent, such as Alice Wiedel, who heads Germany&apos;s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV). French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said she was &quot;delighted&quot; with the FPO&apos;s win, while Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban congratulated Kickl, posting on social media that the results were &quot;another win for the patriots.&quot; FPO is part of a grouping in the European Parliament called Patriots for Europe, formed in June 2024 by Kickl, Orban, and former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Protest in front of the Austrian parliament building following Austrian parliamentary elections on Sept. 29, 2024 in Vienna, Austria.(Christian Bruna/Getty Images)Other European parties, including the Netherlands&apos; PVV and France&apos;s National Rally, joined the grouping shortly before the European Parliament elections in July. The grouping went on to win 84 seats in the 720-seat European Parliament. The FPO&apos;s gains at Austria&apos;s legislative level are &quot;worrying,&quot; Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. There are now three neighboring countries, namely Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, where a Ukraine-skeptic party has become the largest political force. These parties could be characterized as &quot;pro-Russian, either ideologically or strategically,&quot; Umland said. The far-right parties across Europe differ in terms of ideology, but they are united by the one shared belief that Kyiv should not receive military support, Sebastian Schaffer, the director of the Vienna-based Institute for the Danube Region and Central Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. Their rhetoric follows typical Kremlin narratives, such as needing peace above all else and that supporting Ukraine prolongs the war, Schaffer said. In Austria, however, neutrality is a particularly important topic. Austrians value the narrative of their own post-World War II neutrality to such an extent that it&apos;s practically &quot;become a myth in itself,&quot; according to Schaffer. Austria is not a member of NATO, and a poll in May 2023 showed that 60% of Austrians are against becoming a member of the alliance. The poll also found that 21% of Austrians considered EU support for Ukraine in the face of Russia&apos;s invasion &quot;not important at all.&quot; While the FPO primarily campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, the party has long presented itself as the political force that will ensure Austria&apos;s &quot;neutrality&quot; in the face of threats to global security. FPO lawmakers left the Austrian parliament building in March 2023 when President Volodymyr Zelensky came to give a speech, showing signs advocating for &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;neutrality.&quot; &quot;We are neither on the Russian nor the Ukrainian side,&quot; Kickl said, referring to FPO MPs as &quot;neutrality advocates.&quot; The FPO&apos;s track record suggests otherwise. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Kickl has opposed military aid to Kyiv and Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU and argued sanctions against Russia do more harm to Austria than good. In 2016, the FPO became the first and only party in Europe to sign a partnership agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s United Russia party. In 2018, Kickl visited Moscow while holding the position of Austrian Interior Minister. Although Kickl claimed in 2021 that the partnership agreement with United Russia had expired, Schaffer believes the ties between the FPO and Russia remain intact. The first interview that Kickl gave following the vote was not to the Austrian state broadcaster but to a new local outlet called Auf Einz, which describes itself as &quot;alternative, independent television.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s one of the worst conspiracy theory-spinning media that is out there,&quot; Schaffer said. &quot;It&apos;s fairly clear that they need money to exist.&quot; &quot;I would bet almost all my savings that this is being funded through the channels that date back to the partnership agreement,&quot; Schaffer said. &quot;I think they are continuing to cooperate.&quot; If proven, it would not be the first case of a Moscow-backed media network seeking to influence European politics. In March, the Czech authorities announced Viktor Medvedchuk, a Kremlin-linked former Ukrainian oligarch, and Artem Marchevskyi, a media manager who used to work at one of Medvedchuk&apos;s TV channels, were behind an outlet called Voice of Europe. Voice of Europe reportedly centered around the promotion of pro-Russian narratives and paying Kremlin-friendly politicians ahead of the European Parliament elections. The question remains whether the FPO will be able to influence Austria&apos;s policies toward Ukraine on a legislative level. With a projected 56 seats in a 183-seat parliament, the FPO will have to form a coalition in order to rule. &quot;I think the FPO will not become a governmental party, as far as I have understood,&quot; Umland said. &quot;There will most probably be a coalition of the other parties against the FPO, like what we see in the regional parliaments in eastern Germany.&quot; &quot;There, the AfD is the strongest, but other parties have teamed up to exclude them,&quot; Umland said. In the same way, mainstream Austrian party leaders have already signaled they are opposed to forming a government with the FPO. The ruling center-right Austrian People&apos;s Party came second with 26% of the vote, while the Social Democrats, who are firmly against the FPO, came third with 21%. The two parties have enough seats to form a coalition. The liberal NEOS party and the Greens were also able to gain seats, and have also ruled out working with FPO. Kickl said he is open to forming a government with &quot;each and every one&quot; of the parties in Austria&apos;s parliament. It&apos;s unlikely that anyone would agree.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-freedom-party-wins-austrian-elections-cementing-further-cementing-russia-friendly-wall-in-central-europe/	2024-09-30T13:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174750606.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia aims to draft 133,000 men during new round of fall conscription	Key developments on Sept. 30: Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regularly occurring fall conscription campaign. The decree applies to Russians who are not in the reserve and are subject to military service. Those soldiers whose service has already expired are to be dismissed. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that Russia is likely recruiting around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Ukraine also adopted a law on mobilization in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine after opened a new front in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. After the law came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, over 4.6 million military-aged men had done so, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry said. Russian troops are using &quot;the maximum range of weapons&quot; to attack the recently recaptured aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Kharkiv Group of Forces spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said on Sept. 30. Describing the situation as &quot;difficult,&quot; Sarantsev said Russian forces were continuously assaulting in the Kharkiv sector, and had made the Vovchansk plant its &quot;number one goal.&quot; Russian troops had been in control of the facility for several months before it was recaptured by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) special forces on Sept. 24, HUR previously reported. &quot;(The plant) is not a tactical target as such for (Russia). But at the same time, the loss of this facility was a very powerful blow to its image,&quot; the spokesperson said. Speaking on national television, Sarantsev said that Russian forces are carrying out attacks against the plant with guided aerial bombs and &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. &quot;In other words, (Russia) is following its standard practice of destroying what it could not capture,&quot; he added. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed last week. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. Colonel Ivan Vinnik, commander of Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently defending the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, has been transferred, the brigade confirmed on Sept. 29. According to Operational Command &quot;North,&quot; Vinnik was transferred &quot;for the purpose of promotion and to transfer combat experience.&quot; It was not announced who would replace him. Vinnik was appointed commander of the 72nd Brigade in August 2022. Under his command, the brigade has defended Vuhledar for more than two years. Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;Since the summer of 2022 till today, I have had a long and difficult journey. But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. I had a loyal and motivated team by my side,&quot; Vinnik said in a post on Facebook. &quot;I thank each and every one of you for your patience, willpower and strength. Thank you for listening, hearing, talking and offering suggestions. Thank you for our joint struggle. &quot;Thank you for being by my side. I really appreciate it! I am honoured to be a part of the Black Cossacks, and the bond that has been formed between us will remain forever.&quot; The reshuffle comes at a time when fierce fighting for Vuhledar is still ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of Vuhledar as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. A day later, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating from the town and released a video from the town. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState claimed on Sept. 29 that Russian troops trying to gain a foothold in high-rise buildings on the outskirts of Vuhledar. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan will be made public but some parts will remain secret, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 29. Zelensky presented the five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Speaking on national TV, Yermak said the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; he added. While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports emerged that the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia. Following the visit to the U.S., presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said that Washington took the plan &quot;constructively.&quot; Kyiv was targeted by several waves of Russian attack drones overnight, city authorities said on Sept. 30. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital just after 1 a.m., with the all clear not being given until just after 6 a.m. As air defenses engaged the drones, Kyiv Independent correspondents heard multiple explosions, anti-aircraft fire, and the sound of unmanned aerial vehicles flying overhead in at least one district of the city. Shortly before 5 a.m., Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said several drones were &quot;over and near the capital,&quot; adding: &quot;Stay in shelters!&quot; No damage or casualties were reported, though Klitschko said the wreckage of one drone was found near a residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Obolon district. &quot;All Russian attack drones that threatened Kyiv were neutralized,&quot; Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said in a post on Telegram, adding several waves had attacked the city from different directions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force later said Russian forces had launched 73 Shahed-type drones against cities across Ukraine overnight, 67 of which were intercepted. It did not specify how many had attacked Kyiv. Russian drone attacks on Kyiv have stepped up in recent weeks &#x2014; overnight on Sept. 26, more than 15 drones were spotted near the capital, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-aims-to-draft-133-000-during-new-round-of-fall-conscription/	2024-09-30T13:03:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Recurring failures to launch Satan ICBM throw shadow on Putin's nuclear saber-rattling	Years back, Russia began the development of several new strategic weapons, as Russian President Vladimir Putin had called them, to modernize the country&#x2019;s military and give it an edge against the so-called West, a conflict that was in full swing. Among them was the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, known as Satan II. Following the start of the full-scale war, the missile was officially operational, according to Russian state officials. In late September, however, an explosion crater, roughly 60 meters wide at the Yubileynaya silo launch site at the Russian cosmodrome Plesetsk in the town of Mirny, showed that official statements were most likely an exaggeration. Although the Kremlin has denied that it conducted ICBM test launches, the satellite imagery of the launch site showed an explosion that was linked to the Sarmat missile. If confirmed, this would be the fourth failed Sarmat launch. &quot;The (RS-28) Sarmat was supposed to enter into service six to seven years ago, and there is already quite a delay. So, I think right now, Russian decision-makers might get a bit nervous,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. With Ukrainian troops occupying swats of land in Russia and Ukrainian drones hitting Russian arms depots on a regular occurrence, nuclear saber-rattling was among the last leverages the Kremlin had in an attempt to cut Kyiv from Western weapons and political support. The Russian military will be able to &quot;determine the conditions&quot; for the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state-controlled television on Sept. 29. &quot;(The military) closely monitors what weapons are used and how. They are the ones who record the direct involvement of the countries of the collective West in the (war in) Ukraine, and they will not diminish their focus,&quot; Peskov said. Following yet another failed launch, Russia&#x2019;s ability to act on its threats was questioned. Putin introduced the RS-28 Sarmat in March 2018, along with the hypersonic missile Avangard and the Kinzhal ballistic missile, which is regularly used by Russian forces to attack Ukrainian cities far from the front line. The 35-meter RS-28 Sarmat silo-based missile is intended to replace the R-36 ICBMs, which are known by the NATO reporting name of SS-18 &quot;Satan.&quot; The recent Russian development is reportedly capable of carrying up to 15 nuclear warheads and covering nearly 18,000 kilometers (11,000 miles). &quot;Each warhead reportedly has a yield of 500 kilotons. So, you get a five-megaton payload, which is quite substantial. These are independently targetable at different sites. So, I have one ICBM, and I can theoretically use that ICBM to launch 10 warheads against 10 cities,&quot; Hoffmann said. The Sarmat&apos;s initial launch phase is reportedly short, allowing little time for surveillance systems to track it. In 2022, after launching an all-out war against Ukraine, Putin said the Sarmat would &quot;reliably ensure the security of Russia from external threats and make those who, in the heat of aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country, think twice.&quot; Nothing had followed. Even though in September 2023, Yuri Borisov, the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said the Sarmat missiles have &quot;assumed combat duty,&quot; according to Russian news agency reports, the latest test run proves otherwise. Relying only on satellite images, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the explosion, said Hans Kristensen, associate senior fellow in the SIPRI Weapons of Mass Destruction Programme. However, the expert added that to create such destruction, it seems likely that the missile exploded inside the silo. According to Hoffmann, the explosion could have been triggered by liquid fuel, which is more sensitive to stimuli than solid fuel. Meanwhile, the incident could have been prompted by other reasons as well. &quot;We don&apos;t know how desperately, but Russia is very eager to upgrade its aging silo fleet, which has not been updated since the 1980s,&quot; Hoffmann said, referring to the latest modifications of the R-36 and UR-100N ICBMs. Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (L) chairs a meeting regarding the situation in Kursk Oblast, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, on Aug. 12, 2024. (Gavril Grigoriov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Russian ICBMs and other heavy missiles have been designed and produced in modern-day Ukraine, with Sarmat being Russia&apos;s first attempt to develop a liquid-fueled ICBM. Yet Hoffman does not rule out the possibility that Russia is still using parts of its previous developments to create new ICBMs. The SS-18 Satan, the Sarmat&apos;s predecessor, was to a large port developed in Ukraine, which played a big role in maintaining these missiles until 2014 when Russia launched its war against Ukraine, Hoffman said. &quot;Then, there is a question of whether Russia was able to build up its own maintenance logistics around the missile or indeed just relying on decommissioned &#x420;-36&#x41C;s to serve as a spare powered material.&quot; The expert noted that the situation in Russian production is not known for sure, but if this is true, sooner or later, Russia will run out of parts from decommissioned ICBMs. He also does not rule out that Western sanctions may create additional pressure. &quot;This is not too good from a Russian perspective. They (Russians) really want to get this new thing out (the Sarmat) because they don&apos;t want to rely on an aging ICBM that potentially has a limited number of spare parts left that they can use,&quot; Hoffman said. Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova, thank you for reading this article. While I was on a work trip abroad, away from my family, Russia stepped up its threats of a possible attack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. I would never wish anyone to go to bed every day thinking that they might not see their family or friends in the morning. I believe that our articles give a better understanding of what Ukrainians are dealing with everyday.

Energoatom orders additional protection for Rivne Nuclear Power Plant only at end of September, media reports	Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy agency Energoatom signed on Sept. 25 a contract worth Hr 509 million ($12.3 million) for the design and construction of a protective structure at the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant, Ukrainian investigative media outlet Nashi Groshi reported on Sept. 30. The outlet noted that the agreement was concluded only after President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants and that the infrastructure around the plants was not properly protected. The protective structures around the plants include U-shaped structures that shield large transformers from drones and shrapnel damage in the event of an indirect missile hit, Nashi Groshi said. Energoatom signed the contract via Prozorro, Ukraine&apos;s electronic public procurement system, designed to increase transparency and competition in the bidding process, Nashi Groshi reported. The outlet also said that the contract itself was not published on Prozorro, so details about how many and how large the structures that are to be built under this new contract will be are unknown. For comparison, Ukrainian state grid operator Ukrenergo recently signed contracts worth Hr 98 million ($2.3 million) and Hr 120 million ($2.9 million) for structures that protect one transformer, Nashi Groshi reported. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the former head of Ukrenergo, said in an interview with Suspilne after his recent dismissal that more than 60 of the company&apos;s facilities have these types of protective structures. According to Kudrytskyi, these structures helped Ukrenergo recover from a mass Russian attack on Aug. 26. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter due to the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. There are three operating nuclear power plants on Ukrainian-held territory: the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks cut off power to the units, putting their safety in jeopardy. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/energoatom-orders-additional-protection-for-rivne-nuclear-power-plant-only-at-end-of-september/	2024-09-30T11:43:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Belarusian military starts checking combat capability of Air Force, Air Defense	The Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on Sept. 30 a new stage of inspection of its Armed Forces&apos; military units, with a focus on the air force and air defense troops, according to the statement. The combat training tasks will involve all training areas of the Belarusian Armed Forces. During the inspection, military conscripts from the country&apos;s reserves will be called up, the ministry said. Two anti-aircraft missile and two radio-technical brigades, five anti-aircraft missile regiments, and three air bases may be involved in the inspection, according to the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun. Minsk is Moscow&apos;s closest ally and hosts Russian troops and missiles, but has so far not been directly involved in Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview on Aug. 15 that Belarus moved a third of its army to the border with Ukraine earlier in the summer. Speaking to the Rossiya TV channel, Lukashenko claimed it was in response to a build-up of Ukrainian troops that had been prompted by a misinterpretation of preparations for Belarus&apos;s Independence Day celebrations on July 3. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry released a statement on Aug. 25 that Belarus is &quot;concentrating a significant number&quot; of weaponry and personnel at the border with Ukraine, including some former Wagner Group mercenaries. The Foreign Ministry warned, &quot;in case of a violation of Ukraine&apos;s state border by Belarus, our state will take all necessary measures to exercise the right to self-defense guaranteed by the UN Charter.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/belarusian-army-starts-checking-combat-capability-of-air-force-air-defense/	2024-09-30T09:31:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1522418745.jpg
Opinion: War risk insurance bridges the gap in Ukraine’s reconstruction	Ukraine is at a crucial turning point. As we focus on reconstruction amid ongoing Russian aggression, one aspect is pivotal to our success: war risk insurance. This tool is indispensable for attracting foreign investment and ensuring the resilience of local businesses. War risk insurance is designed to protect businesses against losses caused by military conflict, covering a wide range of risks, from physical destruction to operational disruptions. Its importance extends beyond damage recovery &#x2013; it&#x2019;s about building confidence, which is essential for both investors and businesses operating in conflict zones like Ukraine. One notable example of mitigating war risks is a collective plan with funds shared by multiple states. We all know about the Marshall Plan during World War II, which provided significant financial assistance to European countries to help rebuild their economies and infrastructure after the war. While the primary focus of the Marshall Plan was economic recovery and reducing risks of future conflict, it effectively provided a form of war risk insurance. By fostering stability and confidence, it created a favorable environment for investors and contributed to Europe&apos;s long-term recovery and growth. Several insurance programs are currently addressing war risks in Ukraine. International agencies, such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), have made significant strides. DFC, for example, recently announced $357 million in new political risk insurance to protect critical investments necessary for our recovery. MIGA offers coverage for foreign investors starting at $5 million, with terms lasting up to 20 years. Some international programs may not specialize in Ukraine, but they offer political and war risk insurance that includes coverage for investments in the country. However, the process for securing coverage from international agencies can be slow and bureaucratic, often taking many months. Limited available information complicates this further. This creates challenges for investors seeking confidence and swift protection, especially in high-risk areas. Despite the growing presence of international insurers, a significant gap remains &#x2013; especially for medium and high-value commercial property and for Ukrainian businesses requiring coverage exceeding $5 million. It&#x2019;s important to note that international agencies aren&#x2019;t the only ones providing war risk coverage. Local providers, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s Export Credit Agency (ECA) and private insurers like ARX and INGO, are playing an increasingly important role. ECA has made progress offering war and political risk insurance for Ukrainian businesses, covering projects up to 200 million hryvnias (about $5 million), with premiums ranging from 0.5% to 8%. However, ECA has yet to issue any significant investment insurance policies, signaling that more must be done to bridge the gap between potential and reality. Meanwhile, private insurers like ARX and Oranta are offering coverage for property damage caused by war, with premiums averaging between 1-3% of the insured amount. Their coverage limits typically cap at &#xA0;10-20 million hryvnias ($241,369-$482,738), providing a vital, albeit limited, service to small Ukrainian businesses. International stakeholders&apos; participation is critical. Organizations like USAID, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), DFC, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are essential in overcoming the bottlenecks in war risk insurance. These organizations are uniquely positioned to offer financial and structural support to local and international insurers, enabling them to provide larger-scale coverage, faster processing times, and more flexible terms. For Ukraine, these organizations are not just partners but crucial stakeholders, whose support will directly impact the pace of recovery. High hopes are placed on their ability to work with private and state insurers to create a robust framework capable of meeting Ukraine&#x2019;s complex insurance needs. The recent appointment of the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine&#x2019;s Economic Recovery brings new optimism. This role is expected to play a pivotal part in galvanizing international coordination on war risk insurance. By working closely with institutions like DFC and USAID, the Special Representative can help streamline processes and expand coverage &#x2013; critical steps toward unlocking more investment in Ukraine. Additionally, representatives for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction have been appointed by countries such as France, Poland, Germany, Italy, and others. These appointments reflect a unified international commitment to supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery. However, more countries would benefit from appointing similar representatives to enhance international coordination, streamline aid delivery, and ensure a comprehensive approach to recovery. Despite the availability of war risk insurance, coverage for medium and large-scale commercial properties remains far below what&#x2019;s needed to support Ukraine&apos;s recovery. Existing solutions, while helpful, only cover a fraction of the demand. This gap leaves businesses exposed and the market underserved, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and robust insurance offerings to fully protect investments and encourage large-scale reconstruction efforts. Expanding these services is essential for boosting investor confidence and driving sustainable economic growth in Ukraine. Ukraine is offering foreign investors the protection they need, but we must strengthen the infrastructure to back it up. Communication must also be systematic to provide transparency and confidence to everyone interested in doing business with Ukraine. War risk insurance should be seen as a core part of our reconstruction strategy, not only underwriting new investments but also safeguarding existing businesses that remain the backbone of our economy. As a member of the Ukrainian parliament and representative to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I call on our partners in Europe and the international financial community to take decisive action. It is vital that we develop and fund war risk insurance programs that allow Ukraine to unlock its full potential as a strategic economic player in Europe and the global market. Insurance programs must target large, medium, and small businesses, offering a variety of insurance products to meet diverse needs. The road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but with the right financial tools, Ukraine can emerge from this war stronger, more resilient, and more connected to the global economy than ever before. War risk insurance is the key to unlocking that future.

Opinion: Is Russia’s new nuclear doctrine a game of bluff or a shift in strategy?	Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a seemingly significant modification of Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine in a statement on Sept. 25. He revealed that the new doctrine would propose considering aggression against Russia by a non-nuclear state, &#x201C;with the participation or support of a nuclear state,&#x201D; as a &#x201C;joint attack&#x201D; on Russia. Putin&#x2019;s message to the West is clear: If you help Ukraine militarily, we may also target you. The Russian president further explained that the new doctrine will &#x201C;clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons.&#x201D; &#x201C;We will consider such a possibility (of nuclear retaliation) when we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack assets and them crossing our state border,&#x201D; Putin warned darkly, citing &#x201C;strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, (and) &#xA0;hypersonic and other flying vehicles.&#x201D; He clarified that the changes apply to both Russia and Belarus. What makes this threat different from Putin&#x2019;s earlier ones is not its boldness but that it concerns a forthcoming formal document. Despite this, Putin&#x2019;s announcements do not fundamentally alter Russia&#x2019;s position. The pre-announced changes to Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine are as much a psychological operation by the Kremlin as previous nuclear intimidations. As with past threats, Moscow aims to scare away foreign supporters of Ukraine from continuing and expanding their aid. The proposed change in military doctrine is another attempt to curtail Western assistance to Ukraine. However, it&#x2019;s important to put Putin&#x2019;s statement in context. Russian official texts &#x2013; whether laws, doctrines, or treaties &#x2013; carry little weight in a country where there is no rule of law and state behavior is marked by arbitrariness. As in domestic affairs, Kremlin decisions are based on political preferences, with legal acts being adapted, interpreted or amended as needed. Putin&#x2019;s latest threats are linked to ongoing strategic debates in the West. One critical discussion is whether to provide Ukraine with more advanced &#xA0;weaponry, including Germany&#x2019;s highly effective, yet now notorious, Taurus cruise missiles. Another debate concerns allowing Ukraine to use Western missiles inside Russia. The latter, in particular, seems to be a source of concern for the Kremlin. These issues must be viewed in their broader historical context. For more than two years, Ukraine has attacked Russian military targets in Crimea, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts &#x2013; territories Russia considers its own following the illegal annexations of 2014 and 2022, as well as respective changes in the Russian Constitution. More recently, Ukraine has also targeted military and industrial sites within Russia&#x2019;s undisputed territory, including a drone attack on the Kremlin. Some of these strikes, particularly those on large ammunition depots deep inside Russia, have been notably successful. A Russian RS-24 Yars nuclear missile complex arrives at a Victory Day military parade rehearsal in Moscow, Russia, on May 5, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s current military doctrine already allows the use of nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks. Since 2010, the doctrine has permitted nuclear retaliation if the state&apos;s existence is threatened by conventional weapons. This provision was reaffirmed in the 2020 &quot;Foundations of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Area of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; Given Ukraine&#x2019;s repeated attacks on Russian territory, Moscow could have invoked this doctrine long ago as justification for a nuclear response. Since 2014, Putin and his associates have repeatedly signaled their willingness to use nuclear weapons in response to Western-supported Ukrainian resistance against Russia&#x2019;s territorial expansion using conventional weaponry. The phrase &quot;the very existence of the Russian state&quot; could be interpreted to encompass the inviolability of its borders and the security of its airspace &#x2013; including the annexed Ukrainian territories that Moscow now views as part of Russia. Ukraine&#x2019;s strikes and incursions into legitimate and illegally held Russian territory since 2022 could also have been viewed by the Kremlin as justification for retaliating with weapons of mass destruction. However, no nuclear weapons have been used. This is because Russian threats &#x2013; whether verbal or written &#x2013; are not previews of actual actions. They are part of a psychological warfare campaign aimed at undermining Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Putin&#x2019;s recent announcement of changes to Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine is just another move in this high-stakes PR game. A decision to use nuclear weapons would be driven more by political calculations than by doctrinal documents. If the Kremlin believes that using such weapons would enhance its power, it may act &#x2013; regardless of the specific wording in official texts. Political utility, rather than legal obligation, will guide Moscow&#x2019;s choices. This means, first, that an escalation against NATO remains unlikely as long as Moscow believes in the seriousness of the alliance&#x2019;s mutual defense commitments. Second, Western and other governments must make it clear to the Kremlin that using nuclear weapons in Ukraine will have severe consequences. To prevent nuclear escalation, world leaders should send an unequivocal message to Moscow: Further escalation of Russia&#x2019;s genocidal war on Ukraine will not go unpunished. Putin&#x2019;s threats must be met with a resounding global rejection.

Kyiv, Budapest see 'positive dynamics' on national minorities issue, Ukrainian foreign minister says	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 30 after talks with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto in Budapest that both sides see &quot;positive dynamics&quot; in resolving issues related to national minorities, as reported by European Pravda. Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian leadership denies. Hungary has been long considered the most Kremlin-friendly country within the EU, repeatedly obstructing sanctions against Russia and military aid to Kyiv. Sybiha and Szijjarto held talks in a one-on-one format and discussed &quot;in detail a wide bilateral and international agenda,&quot; according to the Ukrainian official. Following the meeting, the Ukrainian minister mentioned opening a bilingual Ukrainian-Hungarian school for Ukrainian children in Hungary. &quot;I am confident that this educational institution will contribute to the preservation of Ukrainian identity, help children adapt to the environment without losing their cultural roots, and will be another step towards understanding between Ukraine and Hungary,&quot; Sybiha said after his visit to the school. Sybiha added that Ukraine reaffirms its bilateral and international commitments to ensure the rights of persons belonging to the Hungarian national community. &quot;Mr. Minister (Szijjarto) and I have noted the positive dynamics in resolving this issue (on national minorities) and agreed to cooperate further to reach an understanding on all sensitive issues,&quot; he said. The Hungarians of Ukraine are &quot;an integral and equal part of the Ukrainian political nation and a key bridge of understanding between the two countries,&quot; Sybiha said. Many of Kyiv and Budapest&apos;s disputes over the national minority question center around Ukraine&apos;s language laws that require at least 70% of education above fifth grade to be conducted in Ukrainian. While Budapest has called this measure discriminatory toward the Hungarian minority, Kyiv retorted that it only aims to ensure that every Ukrainian citizen has sufficient knowledge of the official language. Hungary has formulated an 11-point request to Ukraine regarding the rights of national minorities, which included the restoration of the status of a national school, the ability to gain a high school diploma in Hungarian, and the ability to use Hungarian in public life. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported in mid-March that Hungary has sent a document to the EU member states criticizing Ukraine&apos;s policies on national minorities. In the document, Budapest reportedly demanded the restoration of the rights its minority had before 2015, noting that the protection of national minorities&apos; rights is one of the priorities mentioned in the negotiating framework for Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to the EU. Hungary also called for the possibility of political representation at the regional and national levels, according to the document. Kyiv has not publicly responded to the document. In September 2023, the Ukrainian parliament approved changes to national minorities law, which was one of seven steps recommended by the European Commission in June 2022 for Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union. The changes were signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelensky in November. Russia, a longtime ally of Hungary and its Prime Minister Viktor Orban, claimed, among other pretexts, that it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine to &quot;protect Russian speakers in Ukraine.&quot; There is has been no evidence to support the claim that Russian-speakers in Ukraine faced discrimination. According to the 2023 survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 84% of Ukrainians believe there are no problems with using the Russian language in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-budapest-see-positive-dynamics-on-national-minorities-issue-sybiha-says/	2024-09-30T08:05:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYuIfgEWcAEyrGJ.jpeg
Putin says 'all intended goals will be achieved' in Ukraine on 2nd anniversary of major failed achievement	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30 vowed that &quot;all the intended goals will be achieved&quot; in Ukraine, in a speech marking the second anniversary of something the Kremlin has yet to achieve. In a video message to the Russian public, Putin said he was addressing his people to &quot;celebrate the Day of Reunification with Russia of the Donetsk and Luhansk People&apos;s Republics, Zaporizhia and Kherson Regions.&quot; Putin declared the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in September 2022, despite only partially occupying the southern and eastern areas of Ukraine in question. A Ukrainian counteroffensive just weeks later liberated great swathes of the Kherson Oblast territory, including the provincial capital, claimed by Russia. The regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia remain under Ukrainian control, while Luhansk and Donetsk have been occupied by Russia since 2014. &quot;I cordially congratulate all citizens of our country on this truly fateful event,&quot; Putin said. The Russian president also took aim at Ukraine&apos;s Western allies, who he claimed have &quot;turned Ukraine into their colony, into a military base aimed at Russia.&quot; &quot;They systematically instilled hatred and radical nationalism, incited hostility towards everything Russian, supplied weapons, sent mercenaries and advisers, prepared the Ukrainian army for a new war, so that again, as in the spring and summer of 2014, they could carry out a punitive action in the southeast,&quot; he added. &quot;I thank all citizens of the country for this unity and patriotic spirit. The truth is on our side. All the intended goals will be achieved.&quot; Putin&apos;s original goals in his full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in early 2022 were to &#x201C;liberate the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, &quot;demilitarize and denazify&quot; the country which in the Kremlin&apos;s eyes, envisioned the removal of its Jewish president, and the occupation of its capital city Kyiv. After swiftly failing to achieve these goals, with the exception of Russian forces occupying all of Luhansk Oblast, Putin was forced to lower his ambitions and earlier this month said Russia&apos;s &quot;main goal&quot; was to capture all of Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas area that also includes the adjacent Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-all-intended-goals-will-be-achieved-in-ukraine-on-2nd-anniversary-of-major-failed-achievement/	2024-09-30T06:16:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173708243.jpg
Russia intensifies attacks on recaptured Vovchansk plant, uses 'maximum range of weapons,' military says	Russian troops are using &quot;the maximum range of weapons&quot; to attack the recently recaptured aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Kharkiv Group of Forces spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said on Sept. 30. Describing the situation as &quot;difficult,&quot; Sarantsev said Russian forces were continuously assaulting in the Kharkiv sector, and had made the Vovchansk plant its &quot;number one goal.&quot; Russian troops had been in control of the facility for several months before it was recaptured by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) special forces. on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;(The plant) is not a tactical target as such for (Russia). But at the same time, the loss of this facility was a very powerful blow to its image,&quot; the spokesperson said. Speaking on national television, Sarantsev said that Russian forces are carrying out attacks against the plant with guided aerial bombs and &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. &quot;In other words, (Russia) is following its standard practice of destroying what it could not capture,&quot; he added. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed last week. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-attacks-on-recaptured-vovchansk-plant-as-number-one-goal/	2024-09-30T05:41:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-30-151342.png
Russia aims to draft 133,000 during new round of fall conscription	Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regularly occurring fall conscription campaign. The decree applies to Russians who are not in the reserve and are subject to military service. Those soldiers whose service has already expired are to be dismissed. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that is likely recruiting around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Ukraine adopted a law on mobilization in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine after opened a new front in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. After the law came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, over 4,6 million military-aged men had done so, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-aims-to-draft-133-000-during-new-round-of-fall-conscription/	2024-09-30T04:29:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/gettyimages-1243878229-1-1665572527iw7je.webp
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 45 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and injured at least 45 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 30. Ukrainian forces downed 67 out of 73 Shahed-type drones as well as one Iskander-M ballistic missile, Kh-59/69 cruise missile and a Kh-31P missile launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another drone entered Belarusian airspace and three more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. A Russian air strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least 16 people, including two boys aged 17, and eight, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The attack damaged residential buildings and a railway. Two people were killed in the villages of Lysivka and Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Three more people were injured in the region over the past day. Ten peopled were injured in several communities in Sumy Oblast as a result of guided aerial bomb and FPV drone attacks, local authorities reported. Russian attacks on the villages of Bohuslavka and Odnorobivka in Kharkiv Oblast injured three men and a woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 17 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 12 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-3-injure-45-over-past-day/	2024-09-30T03:26:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-30_09-37-37.jpg
Ukraine's new FM arrives in Hungary, holds talks with Szijjarto	Ukraine&apos;s new Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha arrived in Budapest on Sept. 30 to meet his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto, his ministry has announced. The ministers began talks in a one-on-one format, according to a statement posted on social media. The two are expected to discuss the development of relations, the implementation of joint projects, including protection of the rights of national minorities, and Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU and NATO among other topics. Budapest has repeatedly opposed Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the EU, sanctions on Russia, undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine, and maintained close relations with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. In June, Kyiv imposed sanctions blocking Lukoil, one of the largest oil companies in Russia, from transiting crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline running through Ukrainian territory, affecting supplies to Hungary. The move aims to cut off one of the Kremlin&apos;s sources of income used to finance its war against Ukraine. This is Sybiha&apos;s first trip to Hungary as foreign minister as part of his tour. In recent weeks, he visited Romania and Slovakia. Sybiha&apos;s predecessor, Dmytro Kuleba, and head of the Presidential Office Andrii Yermak held several meeting with Szijjarto before Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv for the first time since the start of the full-scale war. During his talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in early July, Orban urged him to consider a ceasefire as a step toward peace, which Ukraine&apos;s president dismissed, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-fm-arrives-in-budapest-holds-talks-with-szijjarto/	2024-09-30T01:42:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/459035259_944440644393068_5124456779231225497_n.jpg
Some details of Ukraine's victory plan will remain secret, Yermak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan will be made public but some parts will remain secret, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 29. Zelensky presented the five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Speaking on national TV, Yermak said the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; he added. While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports emerged that the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia Following the visit to the U.S., presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said that Washington took the plan &quot;constructively.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians/	2024-09-30T01:31:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/ffacfaa7983e7e7df4c60c3a62791069_1714407581_extra_large.jpeg
Commander of Ukraine's 72nd Brigade transferred amid battle for Vuhledar	Colonel Ivan Vinnik, commander of Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently defending the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, has been transferred, the brigade confirmed on Sept. 29. According to Operational Command &quot;North,&quot; Vinnik was transferred &quot;for the purpose of promotion and to transfer combat experience.&quot; It was not announced who would replace him. Vinnik was appointed commander of the 72nd Brigade in August 2022. Under his command, the brigade has defended Vuhledar for more than two years. Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;Since the summer of 2022 till today, I have had a long and difficult journey. But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. I had a loyal and motivated team by my side,&quot; Vinnik said in a post on Facebook. &quot;I thank each and every one of you for your patience, willpower and strength. Thank you for listening, hearing, talking and offering suggestions. Thank you for our joint struggle. &quot;Thank you for being by my side. I really appreciate it! I am honoured to be a part of the Black Cossacks, and the bond that has been formed between us will remain forever.&quot; The reshuffle comes at a time when fierce fighting for Vuhledar is still ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of Vuhledar as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. A day later, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating from the town and released a video from the town. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState claimed on Sept. 29 that Russian troops trying to gain a foothold in high-rise buildings on the outskirts of Vuhledar. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-72nd-brigade-commander-dismissed-amid-battles-for-vuhledar/	2024-09-29T23:34:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/298546450_376472717990310_6001794130969474415_n.jpg
Hours of explosions heard in Kyiv as capital fends of waves of Russian attack drones	Kyiv was targeted by several waves of Russian attack drones overnight, city authorities said on Sept. 30. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital just after 1 a.m., with the all clear not being given until just after 6 a.m. As air defenses engaged the drones, Kyiv Independent correspondents heard multiple explosions, anti-aircraft fire, and the sound of the UAVs flying overhead in at least one district of the city. Shortly before 5 a.m., Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said several drones were &quot;over and near the capital,&quot; adding: &quot;Stay in shelters!&quot; No damage or casualties have been reported at this time, though Klitschko said the wreckage of one drone had been found near a residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Obolon district. &quot;All Russian attack drones that threatened Kyiv were neutralized,&quot; Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said in a post on Telegram, adding several waves had attacked the city from different directions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force later said Russian forces had launched 73 Shahed-type drones against cities across Ukraine overnight, 67 of which were intercepted. It did not specify how many had attacked Kyiv. Russian drone attacks on Kyiv have stepped up in recent weeks &#x2013; overnight on Sept. 26, more than 15 drones were spotted near the capital, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/hours-of-explosions-heard-in-kyiv-as-capital-fends-of-waves-of-russian-attack-drones/	2024-09-29T22:49:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-09_17-13-51.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 653,060 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 653,060 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 30. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,874 tanks, 17,503 armored fighting vehicles, 25,548 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,822 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 963 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,224 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-653-060-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-09-29T22:06:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166827688-1.jpg
Helsinki Commission paper calls for reconsideration of US strategy toward Russia, The Hill reports	The bipartisan committee tasked with promoting democracy and human rights in post-Soviet states is urging the U.S. to abandon its post-Cold War approach to Russia and officially recognize Moscow as a &quot;persistent&quot; threat to global security. In a report obtained by The Hill ahead of its release, the Helsinki Commission calls for a major shift in Washington&apos;s strategy toward Russia, similar to its recent rethinking of relations with China, and recommends allocating resources accordingly. A key element of the proposed strategy is ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s victory in its war against Russia. The report advocates for &quot;massive&quot; military and humanitarian aid to Kyiv and supports allowing Ukraine&apos;s forces to strike targets deep inside Russia using U.S.-supplied weapons. These recommendations go beyond the Biden administration&#x2019;s current commitments to Ukraine and conflict with the views of former President Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his congressional allies. Trump has argued that the U.S. is overspending on European security and has campaigned on negotiating a deal between Ukraine and Russia through direct talks with their leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Helsinki Commission&apos;s report recommends that Russia&apos;s nuclear threats &quot;cannot simply be dismissed,&quot; but should instead be countered with &quot;sound reasoning.&quot; &quot;We can&#x2019;t let fear dominate how we think about this kind of stuff,&quot; a congressional aide said, explaining the report&#x2019;s call for a clear plan to address and respond to potential nuclear threats and attacks. The report also advocates for a shift in how Washington views Russia, urging policymakers to stop treating the country as a superpower or near-peer to the U.S. solely because of its nuclear arsenal. The report emphasizes the need for the U.S. to be fully engaged with its global allies, particularly those on the front lines of Russian aggression, manipulation, and coercion. This stance pushes back against the rising trend of isolationism, especially within the GOP.	https://kyivindependent.com/helsinki-commission-paper-calls-for-reconsideration-of-us-strategy-toward-russia-the-hill-reports/	2024-09-29T20:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1546180412.jpg
Norway considering building fence along Russian border to curb migrant crossings	Norway is considering building fencing along the country&apos;s border with Russia amid ongoing concerns over migrant crossings, Norway&apos;s Justice Minister Emily Anger Mel said in an interview with Norway&apos;s NRK media outlet. Mel said that the country is looking at &quot;several measures&quot; to increase security along the nearly 200 km northern border with Russia, including building fences. &quot;A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border&quot; Mel told NRK in an interview published late on Sept. 28 No details have yet to be provided about a potential plan and it is unclear as to whether the whole 200 km border would be fenced off. The consideration follows neighboring Finland&apos;s construction of a border fence after Finland accused Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging migrants from countries like Syria and Somalia to cross the border. Finland closed its land borders with Russia late last year after more than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia. Pointing to concerns over a lack of security at the Norway-Russia border, Mel cited a 2015 example of approximately 5,000 asylum seekers who arrived at the Sturskug border in northeastern Norway - the only legal land border crossing between the two countries. No data was immediately available as to how many Russian migrants crossed the border since the start of the full-scale invasion. In November 2023, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said that the country may follow the example of Finland and close its land border crossing with Russia &quot;if necessary&quot; &#xA0;- although it has yet to do so. Reports of Moscow-orchestrated migrant crisis echo the strategy used by Belarus against its NATO neighbors. Minsk has been facilitating flows of third-country migrants to the Baltic countries and Poland since 2021.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-considering-building-fence-along-russian-border-to-curb-migrant-crossings/	2024-09-29T17:06:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1258278947.jpeg
Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast injure 10	Russian forces attacked 14 communities on Sept. 29, injuring 10 people throughout the day, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. In the town of Esman, five people were injured after a Russian KAB guided aerial bomb struck the community. Another KAB guided bomb attack on the village of Hlukiv injured a further two people. According to the Sumy Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office, the attack on Esman injured a total of five women between the ages of 38 and 77, while in Hlukhiv a 53-year-old woman and her 50-year-old husband were injured. Elsewhere in Sumy Oblast, drone attacks targeted various communities resulting in civillian casualties. In Yampil, one person was injured as a result of a Russian drone attack, while in the village of Druzhba two others were injured. According to investigators, the drone attack in the village of Druzhba targeted a passenger train at the railway station. The train conductor and an employee of the railway station were injured in the attacks. No details were provided on the attack on the community of Yampil. Residents in Sumy Oblast are subjected to daily attacks on the region, with Russia intensifying the use of KAB guided aerial bombs in the area. On Sept. 28, Russian forces launched a double-tap strike on a hospital in the northeastern city of Sumy, killing 10 people and injuring 22. Moscow initially attacked with an airstrike and Shahed-type drones, followed by a powerful KAB guided bomb strike, the Air Force confirmed. The security situation in Sumy Oblast became more tense with the start of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in Russia, which began on Aug. 6. Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with CNN, published on Sept. 5, that Russia was planning an offensive from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast onto Sumy Oblast before Ukrainian forces launched operations there. In late August, amid ongoing attacks on the region, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko told reporters that authorities are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from Sumy Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-sumy-oblast-injure-10/	2024-09-29T15:19:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/IMG_2804.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky says Putin 'afraid' to use nuclear weapons because he 'loves his life'	Key developments on Sept. 29: President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed skepticism in an interview with Fox News over Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s continued nuclear threats throughout the full-scale war, saying that Putin &quot;loves his life&quot; and is, therefore, likely afraid to use nuclear weapons. &quot;Nobody knows what&apos;s in his head,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview, which was posted to the president&apos;s official Youtube channel on Sept. 29. &quot;He could use nuclear (weapons) on any country at any time &#x2013; or not. (But) I don&apos;t think that he will.&quot; Since the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of its nuclear arsenal to deter Western military support for Ukraine. The Russian military will be able to &quot;determine the conditions&quot; for the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state-controlled television on Sept. 29. &quot;(The military) closely monitors what weapons are used and how. They are the ones who record the direct involvement of the countries of the collective West in the (war in) Ukraine, and they will not diminish their focus,&quot; Peskov said. Peskov went on to blame NATO member states for aiding Ukraine in its war effort against Russia, claiming that it &quot;made it necessary to make adjustments both to the nuclear doctrine and to the foundations of state policy in the area of &#x200B;&#x200B;nuclear deterrence.&quot; In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 28, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Ukraine and its Western allies should not try &quot;to fight to victory with a nuclear power.&quot; Lavrov&apos;s remarks come days after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed revisions to Moscow&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia with guided bombs overnight on Sept. 29, injuring at least 16 civilians, local authorities reported. As of 1:58 p.m. local time, the number of injured stands at 16, according to regional police. Among the wounded include a 17-year-old boy. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said via his official Telegram channel that the city was targeted at least 10 times. Several buildings caught fire following the attack which also destroyed a high-rise and several residential homes. More people may be trapped under the rubble, Fedorov added. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces. On Sept. 23, Russia&apos;s strike against the city killed one man and injured seven other civilians, including a 13-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, according to local authorities. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. Ukrainian forces struck the Kotluban military arsenal in Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast, the General Staff reported on Sept. 29. The military arsenal was used to store and modernize missiles and artillery, according to the General Staff. Iranian-made Shahed missiles had also been transported to the facility shortly before the attack took place. &quot;The military facility was heavily protected by electronic warfare and air defense systems. Nevertheless, our units successfully completed the combat mission,&quot; the General Staff wrote. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify the claim. Earlier on Sept. 29, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 67 Ukrainian-launched drones were shot down over Volgograd Oblast and that 125 drones in total had been intercepted over seven Russian regions. Kyiv has carried out a number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations throughout the full-scale war, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Russian officials often play down attacks and claim no significant damage was inflicted. Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 18. On Sept. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed a strike on the Tikhoretsk weapons depot in Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of three largest ammunition depots in Russia and &quot;one of the key storage facilities in the Russian military&apos;s logistics system.&quot; One hundred twenty-five Ukrainian drones launched overnight were intercepted over seven Russian regions, Russian state-controlled media TASS claimed on Sept. 29. The drones targeted Volgograd, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, Bryansk, and Kursk oblasts, as well as Krasnodar Krai, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Ministry also claims three drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov. The aforementioned regions are located at various distances along Ukraine&apos;s eastern border. The ministry claims 67 drones were shot down over Volgograd Oblast, 17 over Belgorod Oblast, 17 over Voronezh Oblast, 18 over Rostov Oblast, and one each over Bryansk and Kursk oblasts. There has been no comment on the attacks from Kyiv. Kyiv has carried out a number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations throughout the full-scale war, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. No casualties resulted from the drones targeting Voronezh Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev claimed. The drone attack inflicted property damage in the city and the surrounding region, including one residential building that was &quot;significantly damaged,&quot; but somehow &quot;none of the residents need temporary housing,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-says-putin-afraid-to-use-nuclear-weapons-because-he-loves-his-life/	2024-09-29T12:44:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768511.jpeg
Far-right party opposed to Ukraine aid wins Austria elections	Austria&#x2019;s far-right Freedom Party came first in a general election on Sept. 29, according to voter projections. The party is known for its Kremlin-friendly stance and opposition to aid for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Freedom Party of Austria, or FPO, which is led by Herbert Kickl, is expected to secure 29.1% of the vote over the ruling conservative Austrian People&apos;s Party and the center-left Social Democrats. Following the elections, the party will have to create a coalition government, but other party leaders have already signaled they are opposed to forming a government with the FPO. Kickl has recently forged an alliance with Orban and opposes providing aid to Kyiv. He has also said he wants sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine lifted, claiming they hurt his country more than Moscow. The country&#x2019;s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, has criticized the FPO for its stance on Ukraine and failure to condemn Russia&#x2019;s aggression against the country, as well as its Euroskepticsm. The FPO, which was originally formed by a Nazi lawmaker in the 1950s, is critical of immigration and asylum seekers, saying it will curb migration to Austria. The election follows other far-right election successes in the Netherlands, France, and Germany.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-party-opposed-to-ukraine-aid-wins-austria-elections/	2024-09-29T12:13:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174719950.jpg
Denmark to invest nearly $630 million into Ukraine's defense production	Denmark will invest 4.2 billion Danish kroner ($628 million) into Ukraine&apos;s arms production, according to Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. Poulsen signed the following agreements with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov and Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin in Kyiv. The Danish defense minister&apos;s trip to Kyiv took place as part of the run-up to the defense industries forum set to start on Oct. 1. Of the sum announced by Poulsen, 1.3 billion kroner ($200 million) will be provided by the Danish government, while the rest will be provided by Denmark as part of the country&apos;s commitments to hand over profits obtained from frozen Russian assets. &quot;It is important that we continue to support Ukraine&apos;s freedom struggle in all the ways we can,&quot; Poulsen said. The Danish government has previously allocated 130 million Danish kroner ($19.5 million) to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after Russia&apos;s mass attacks, according to the Sept. 23 Denmark Energy Ministry&apos;s statement. The Danish government also announced a $115 million military aid package for Ukraine on Aug. 19. The Danish government promised to transfer another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine later this year, Poulsen said earlier this month. Copenhagen has pledged to deliver 19 aircraft to Ukraine in total but did not disclose how many had already been provided. Poulsen did not name the size of the second batch either &quot;for the sake of operational security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-to-invest-nearly-630-million-into-ukraines-defense-production/	2024-09-29T11:59:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996068.jpg
The Insider: Obtained documents drawn following Navalny's death omit acute stomach pain, hint at possible poisoning	According to The Insider, the Russian independent investigative outlet received access to &quot;hundreds&quot; of official documents that were drawn following the death of Alexei Navalny in a penal colony in Russia&apos;s Arctic. The discrepancy between internal documents and the ones made public by the state suggests that officials have lied about the causes of death and forged documents meant for the public eye. The initial documents detail moments before Navalny&apos;s death. According to papers signed by investigator Alexander Voropaev, Navalny felt sick, fell to the floor, and called for help, saying that he felt severe stomach pain and began to vomit. In the final version of the same document, stomach pain and vomiting were omitted. According to intensivist Alexander Polupan, who provided care for Navalny following his poisoning with Novichok nerve agent in 2020, all the symptoms in the initial documents hint at yet another poisoning. &quot;Such symptoms can hardly be explained by something other than poisoning,&quot; Polupan told The Insider. Navalny was Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s main opponent, and the Kremlin had used all the tools at its disposal to shut him up. He was sentenced in several criminal cases, and some of his allies have also been imprisoned. Back in 2020, Navalny was poisoned in Russia and flown for treatment to Germany while in a coma. German doctors, as well as several independent labs in Europe, said that he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent &#x2013; a chemical weapon produced by the Russian government. A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned by agents of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service. The media also identified the agents&apos; names.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-insider-official-documents-following-navalnys-death-were-forged-hinting-at-possible-poisoning/	2024-09-29T10:18:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1915800931.jpg

Zelensky: Putin 'afraid' to use nuclear weapons because he 'loves his life'	President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed skepticism in an interview with Fox News over Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s continued nuclear threats since the full-scale war, saying that Putin &quot;loves his life&quot; and is, therefore, likely afraid to use nuclear weapons. &quot;Nobody knows what&apos;s in his head,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview, which was posted to the president&apos;s official Youtube channel on Sept. 29. &quot;He could use nuclear (weapons) on any country at any time &#x2013; or not. (But) I don&apos;t think that he will.&quot; Since the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of its nuclear arsenal to deter Western military support for Ukraine. The Russian military will be able to &quot;determine the conditions&quot; for the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state-controlled television on Sept. 29. &quot;(The military) closely monitors what weapons are used and how. They are the ones who record the direct involvement of the countries of the collective West in the (war in) Ukraine, and they will not diminish their focus,&quot; Peskov said. Peskov went on to blame NATO member states for aiding Ukraine in its war effort against Russia, claiming that it &quot;made it necessary to make adjustments both to the nuclear doctrine and to the foundations of state policy in the area of &#x200B;&#x200B;nuclear deterrence.&quot; In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 28, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Ukraine and its Western allies should not try &quot;to fight to victory with a nuclear power.&quot; Lavrov&apos;s remarks come days after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed revisions to Moscow&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-military-can-determine-conditions-for-russias-use-of-nuclear-weapons/	2024-09-29T08:07:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768511.jpg
General Staff: Ukraine strikes Russian military arsenal storing missiles, drones in Volgograd Oblast	Ukrainian forces struck the Kotluban military arsenal in Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast, the General Staff reported on Sept. 29. The military arsenal was used to store and modernize missiles and artillery, according to the General Staff. Iranian-made Shahed missiles had also been transported to the facility shortly before the attack took place. &quot;The military facility was heavily protected by electronic warfare and air defense systems. Nevertheless, our units successfully completed the combat mission,&quot; the General Staff wrote. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify the claim. Earlier on Sept. 29, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 67 Ukrainian-launched drones were shot down over Volgograd Oblast and that 125 drones in total had been intercepted over seven Russian regions. Kyiv has carried out a number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations throughout the full-scale war, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Russian officials often play down attacks and claim no significant damage was inflicted. Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 18. On Sept. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed a strike on the Tikhoretsk weapons depot in Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of three largest ammunition depots in Russia and &quot;one of the key storage facilities in the Russian military&apos;s logistics system.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-ukraine-strikes-russian-military-arsenal-storing-missiles-drones-in-volgograd-oblast/	2024-09-29T06:47:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Ze.jpeg
Russian parliament speaker announces bills tightening migration policy	The Russian State Duma introduced five bills that would tighten migration policy in the country, Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin announced on Sept. 29. There has been an uptick in anti-migration sentiment in Russia in recent months, especially toward migrants from Central Asia, after several gunmen opened fire at a venue in the Moscow suburbs at the end of March. The bills propose harsher punishments for illegal immigrants who commit crimes given their migration status, increased penalties for &quot;organizing&quot; illegal migration, increased liability for forged documents, blocking internet services that offer illegal services to migrants, and banning intermediary organizations involved in administering exams - such as Russian language proficiency - for migrants. Volodin claimed that over 4,500 cases of document forgery were registered by the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry this year. The proposed bills would &quot;contribute to establishing order in the area of migration policy,&quot; he added. Following the terrorist attack on Moscow in late March, Russia began conducting raids on dormitories and apartments known to house Central Asian migrants and carrying out mass deportations. A branch of the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack shortly thereafter, and Russia detained four men from Tajikistan, the alleged perpetrators of the attack. In total, over a dozen people were arrested under suspicion of having a connection to the attack. Central Asian migrants make up a large number of Russia&apos;s workforce. At the end of March, Tajikistan&apos;s Labor, Employment, and Migration Ministry reported that more Tajik migrants in Russia were returning home than usual.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-state-duma-announces-bills-that-would-tighten-migration-policy/	2024-09-29T06:28:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1855401938.jpg
Ukraine commemorates 83rd anniversary of Babyn Yar tragedy	Ukraine commemorated the 83rd anniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy on Sept. 29, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that it is a &quot;terrifying symbol&quot; of what can happen when the world &quot;lacks the determination to stand up against evil.&quot; The Babyn Yar tragedy was a mass murder of nearly 34,000 Jews by Nazi forces over two days in September 1941, near Kyiv, as part of the Holocaust. Estimates put the total death toll, which also includes Soviet prisoners of war and the Romani people, at over 100,000. &quot;Babyn Yar is a vivid proof of the savagery that regimes led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence are capable of,&quot; Zelensky said, evidently drawing parallels between the atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II and Russia&apos;s current full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;They have remained unchanged throughout history. But the world&apos;s reaction must be different. This is what the world should have learned. We must stand guard over humanity, life, and justice.&quot; Last year, Zelensky commemorated the anniversary at the site of the massacre in Kyiv with members of the Jewish community. Zelensky emphasized how the Nazis indiscriminately targeted men, women, and children, forcing them to walk down what was later called &quot;the Road of Death&quot; to the Babyn Yar ravine. &quot;The scale of this evil is still hard to perceive,&quot; he added. &quot;When the eyes of the world are closed, humanity loses. We must defend ourselves against evil.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-commemorates-83rd-anniversary-babyn-yar-tragedy/	2024-09-29T04:53:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/382327268_18037735963561006_6852805925983607540_n.jpeg

Moldovan broadcaster's headquarters targeted in pre-election vandalism spree	Moldova&apos;s state-owned broadcaster reported on Sept. 28 that vandals had splashed paint across the entrance of its building in the capital, Chisinau. This incident occurred a day after police attributed similar acts to a group trained in Moscow with the aim of destabilizing the upcoming elections. &quot;We are not afraid of this act of vandalism, as long as we are devoted to society and citizens,&quot; Andrei Zapsa, deputy director general of Teleradio-Moldova, was quoted as saying, according to Reuters. Zapsa noted that the station had always anticipated potential attacks from &quot;radical groups.&quot; Police also reported that vandals poured paint on the Supreme Court building overnight. Moldovan authorities have connected these incidents to a group trained in Moscow to provoke instability ahead of next month&#x2019;s presidential election, where pro-European incumbent President Maia Sandu is favored to win against 10 challengers. Sandu&apos;s main opponents include Alexander Stoianoglo, who lost his position as prosecutor general and is supported by pro-Russian opposition parties, and Renato Usatii, who advocates for good relations with both the West and Moscow. On Sept. 27, Moldovan law enforcement agencies detained two young men in connection with similar incidents that occurred overnight, where they splashed yellow paint&#x2014;the color of Sandu&apos;s ruling pro-European party&#x2014;on two other government buildings. Police apprehended a 21-year-old man in a park and his 20-year-old accomplice near the parliament. According to police, the detainees said that they received 5,000 euros for one attack and underwent training in Russia. One of them admitted to recruiting young individuals who later traveled to Moscow and were paid 500 euros a month.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovan-broadcasters-headquarters-targeted-in-pre-election-vandalism-spree/	2024-09-28T22:01:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg
Russia's attack on Zaporizhzhia destroys apartment building, injures 5	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia with guided bombs overnight on Sept. 29, injuring at least five civilians, local authorities reported. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said via his official Telegram channel that the city was targeted at least 10 times. Several buildings caught fire following the attack which also destroyed a high-rise and several residential homes. More people may be trapped under the rubble, Fedorov added. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces. On Sept. 23, Russia&apos;s strike against the city killed one man and injured seven other civilians, including a 13-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, according to local authorities. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-damages-apartment-building-injures-5/	2024-09-28T21:19:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-28-22_16_32.jpeg
North Korea claims that US military aid to Ukraine is 'incredible mistake'	North Korea, facing accusations of illegally supplying weapons to Russia, slammed the U.S. decision to send $8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, labeling it an &quot;incredible mistake&quot; and warning that it risks sparking nuclear conflict with Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced the new aid package, which includes long-range weapons to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s ability to hit Russian targets from safer distances, during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accused the U.S. of intensifying the war in Ukraine and pushing Europe toward the edge of nuclear war, according to Reuters. In a statement released by state news agency KCNA, Kim said: &quot;The United States and the West should not dismiss or underestimate Russia&apos;s serious warning. Are they truly prepared to face the consequences of recklessly playing with fire against Russia, a nuclear superpower?&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly cautioned that Russia may use nuclear weapons if attacked, and he views any assault on Russia supported by a nuclear-armed nation as a collective strike. Kim also condemned the U.S. decision to provide further military aid to Zelensky, calling it a &quot;dangerous and irresponsible gamble&quot; and describing the move as &quot;an incredible mistake and foolish act.&quot; Kim regularly issues statements on North Korea&apos;s political and security positions, which are widely believed to reflect the views of the country&apos;s supreme leader.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-claims-that-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-is-incredible-mistake/	2024-09-28T19:43:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1247659588.jpg
Energoatom confirms detention of company official on bribery charges	Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy agency Energoatom on Sept. 28 confirmed that one of its officials had been detained for accepting a bribe. The official, who leads the control and audit department, was apprehended near Energoatom&apos;s office in Kyiv while accepting a bribe of UAH 100,000 ($2,400). The money was demanded in exchange for resolving fuel supply issues. According to a statement from Energoatom, &quot;The detainee used his connections to help resolve the issue with another company, acting as a middleman between the contractor and the other firm.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Security Service&apos;s (SBU) Main Directorate in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, with oversight from the Kyiv City Prosecutor&apos;s Office, conducted the operation. &quot;A top priority for Energoatom is ensuring compliance with current laws, and the company has a strict zero-tolerance policy for corruption,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;This policy applies not only to internal matters but also to employees&apos; conduct outside of their official duties.&quot; Energoatom plays a crucial role in Ukraine&apos;s energy sector and is actively involved in modernizing and expanding the country&apos;s nuclear power capabilities, despite challenges posed by the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/energoatom-confirms-detention-of-company-official-on-bribery-charges/	2024-09-28T18:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1243382762.jpg
China's FM cautions against 'escalation' of Ukraine-Russia war	China&apos;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi cautioned on Sept. 28 against the escalation of the war in Ukraine, amid accusations from Kyiv that Beijing is supporting Russia. Kyiv has expressed skepticism towards Beijing&apos;s calls for negotiations, yet Wang reiterated China&apos;s willingness to assist in brokering a resolution. &quot;The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,&quot; he said during the U.N. General Assembly, according to Agence France-Presse. &quot;China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains.&quot; China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. This assistance encompassed a range of critical elements, including the supply of crucial components and materials to Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex, the provision of dual-use technologies that have both civilian and military applications, and the delivery of chips, design features, and capacities associated with explosive manufacturing. China has also been instrumental in supporting the development of unmanned aerial vehicles that Russia has deployed in Ukraine, enhancing its battlefield capabilities. Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-fm-cautions-against-escalation-of-ukraine-russia-war/	2024-09-28T15:21:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/W020240724564401152035.jpg
Lithuania delivers ammunition, other support to Ukraine in military aid package	A military aid package that includes ammunition, computers, and logistical supplies will arrive in Ukraine this week, the Lithuanian government announced on Sept. 28. Lithuania has emerged as one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The Baltic nation has provided Ukraine with helicopters, drones, armored vehicles, and air defense equipment along with extensive humanitarian support. &quot;Lithuania continues to provide military support to Ukraine. Logistics, ammunition, laptops and other support for its military will arrive in Ukraine this week,&quot; the government said in a statement. According to Vilnius, Lithuania has already delivered 155 mm ammunition, M577 and M113 armored vehicles, anti-drone systems, anti-tank weapons, remote detonation systems, and other equipment since the beginning of this year. The delivery comes as Ukraine&apos;s front-line troops work to recover from the devastating effects of a spring ammunition shortage. The shortage was brought on in large part by delays in U.S. military assistance. Lithuania on Sept. 23 signed a memorandum with the U.S. Northrop Grumman Corporation, a leading global aerospace and defense technology companies, to produce and supply medium-caliber ammunition. Earlier in September, Lithuania announced plans to allocate 10 million euros ($11 million) to buy new Ukrainian-made Palianytsia missile-drones for Kyiv. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Lithuania has provided Ukraine with military support worth over 683 million euros (approximately $763 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-delivers-ammunition-other-support-to-ukraine-in-military-aid-package/	2024-09-28T12:48:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/lithuania.jpeg
West should not 'fight to victory' against nuclear state, Russian FM says at UN	Ukraine and its Western allies should not try &quot;to fight to victory with a nuclear power,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 28. Since the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of its nuclear arsenal to deter Western military support for Ukraine. In his General Assembly address, Lavrov called Western attempts to defeat Russia &quot;a suicidal escapade.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,&quot; Lavrov said. Lavrov&apos;s remarks come days after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed revisions to Moscow&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Lavrov also derided Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, calling it a &quot;doomed ultimatum&quot; while defending Russia&apos;s ongoing occupation of Ukrainian territory. Russia&apos;s escalating nuclear rhetoric coincides with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington, where he continued to push U.S. President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use American weapons to strike targets deep within Russian. The U.S. announced around $8 billion in additional military aid for Ukraine during the visit, but did not signal any changes to its policy around long-range strikes. Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nikiforov, said during an interview on Ukrainian television that Russia would be &quot;the first to know&quot; if restrictions on long-range attacks were lifted. &quot;First, it is important to understand that the first to learn about the authorization to strike deep into Russian territory will be the Russians themselves,&quot; Nikiforov said. &quot;They will be the first to know it, and then there will be an official announcement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/west-should-not-fight-to-victory-against-nuclear-state-russian-fm-says-at-un/	2024-09-28T12:02:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174265841.jpg
Explosions damage railway bridge in Samara Oblast, Russian media reports	Explosions on a railway bridge in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast have damaged the concrete structures supporting the track, the Russian Telegram news channel Baza reported on Sept. 28. An &quot;unknown device&quot; exploded at around 1:30 p.m. local time near the city of Kinel, Baza reported. The explosion set off car alarms in neighboring villages. A freight train was traveling along the bridge at the time of the explosion, but was not derailed. No casualties have been reported. The explosion damaged two concrete structures supporting the railway bridge. Eyewitnesses claimed they saw a suspicious vehicle driving away from the bridge shortly after the explosion, Baza reported. A number of sabotage attacks have been carried out against Russian railways since the beginning of the full-scale war. Earlier this month, on Sept. 11, Ukrainian reconnaissance and special forces reportedly blew up a railroad in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast. In January 2024, sabotage attacks targeted train tracks in multiple cities in western Russia. &#xA0;Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) did not say whether it was involved in the attacks but said the actions would disrupt Russian military logistics. In November 2023, HUR claimed responsibility for a joint operation against train lines in Moscow Oblast. &#xA0; Around the same time, an explosion on Russia&apos;s far-eastern Baikal-Amur railway line was linked to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-damage-railway-bridge-in-samara-oblast-russian-media-reports/	2024-09-28T10:18:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1237502911.jpg
Russian colonel killed near Moscow, military intelligence says	Aleksey Kolomeitsev, a Russian colonel who trained specialists in the use of attack drones, was killed in the city of Kolomna in Moscow Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 28. Kolomeitsev, 51, led Russia&apos;s 924th State Center of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a military unit responsible for training specialists to operate combat drones. The unit specialized in the use of Shahed drones, which Russia employs daily in mass aerial attacks against Ukraine. Kolomeitsev was found dead in Russia on Sept. 27, HUR reported. The Russian colonel was &quot;directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and war crimes against Ukraine,&quot; HUR said. While HUR did not disclose the details of Kolomeitsev&apos;s death or claim direct responsibility for the killing, the post said that &quot;every war crime will be punished with justice.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-colonel-killed-near-moscow-military-intelligence-says/	2024-09-28T09:25:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1489472156.jpg
Ukrainian Supreme Court judge killed in Russian drone attack	Leonid Loboyko, a judge on Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court, was killed on Sept. 28 by a Russian drone strike in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv Oblast. A Russian FPV drone struck a civilian vehicle on Sept. 28, killing the driver immediately, the Kharkiv Oblast regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported. The Supreme Court&apos;s press service later identified the victim as Loboyko. Loboyko, 61, was a Supreme Court judge of the Cassation Criminal Court. He was reportedly delivering humanitarian aid to residents of the village at the time of the attack. &quot;In the hearts of all who knew Leonid Loboyko, he will always be remembered as a kind, wise and compassionate person,&quot; the Supreme Court&apos;s press office said in a statement. Three women were also injured in the drone strike. They were in the vehicle when it was hit and have all been hospitalized. Attacks on civilian targets are a daily reality in Kharkiv Oblast. On the same day Loboyko was killed, a Russian airstrike on the village of Slatyne killed three people and injured three others. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-supreme-court-judge-killed-in-russian-drone-attack/	2024-09-28T09:04:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/car.jpg
Russian air strike in Kharkiv Oblast kills 3, injures 3	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian air strike on the village of Slatyne in Kharkiv Oblast on Sept. 28 killed three people and injured at least three others, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The attack targeted civilian infrastructure, hitting an educational institution and shops while people were walking on the street, Syniehubov said. One of the victims, a woman, is in serious condition following the attack. No details have been reported on the remaining victims. All emergency services are at work on the scene, and the consequences of the strike are currently under investigation. Kharkiv Oblast borders Russia to the northeast. Repeated daily attacks are a fact of life for the residents of the embattled region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-air-strike-in-kharkiv-oblast-kills-3-injures-3/	2024-09-28T08:28:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147873245.jpg
Russia preparing for assault operations in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian military says	Russian troops appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. The statement comes as Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where the outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. Speaking on national television, Voloshyn said, citing the Ukrainian military&apos;s intelligence data, that Russia is massing personnel for what could be a new manoeuver in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, particularly near the Russian-occupied village of Pryiutne located on the border with Donetsk Oblast. Voloshyn also said on television that Russian troops received 25 light buggies that could be used by small infantry groups for assaults. &quot;These are such signs of preparation for the fact that in the near future, assault actions will be carried out in the Zaporizhzhia direction,&quot; Voloshyn said, though stressing that it would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive. The spokesman suggested that the potential operation may be Russia&apos;s attempt at improving its tactical position in the area, but &#x201C;there is no talk of an offensive yet.&#x201D; The village of Pryiutne lies about 40 kilometers west of Vuhledar, a mining town that Russian troops have been trying to seize for more than two years. Russia has scaled up its offensive on Vuhledar in August, slowly gaining ground to encircle the town. The defense of Vuhledar is strategic as capturing the town would allow Moscow to form the southern flank, which is needed as a staging ground for a bigger push onto Pokrovsk &#x2013; a crucial Ukrainian-controlled logistic hub in the Donbas. Pryiutne is located about 70 kilometers southwest of Pokrovsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-for-assault-operations-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-ukrainian-military-says/	2024-09-28T06:59:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2158959316.jpg
Advisor to Putin accuses West of isolating Kaliningrad by disrupting transit links	Nikolai Patrushev, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, accused the West on Sept. 27 of attempting to isolate Kaliningrad Oblast by disrupting transportation links between the exclave and mainland Russia. Speaking at a meeting in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, Patrushev claimed Western nations are imposing &quot;maximum complications&quot; on cargo and passenger transit to the region. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western countries have imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Russia&apos;s ability to continue the war. These sanctions have limited transportation links to Kaliningrad, Patrushev alleged. Russian state-controlled news agency TASS reported Patrushev as saying Moscow would shift the majority of road and rail cargo between Kaliningrad and mainland Russia to sea routes. He claimed 80% of goods &quot;necessary for the life and economy of the region&quot; cannot be transported by land. Patrushev, a former KGB officer reappointed in May to oversee shipbuilding after serving as secretary of the Security Council, also said Russia plans to prepare two ship and rail routes by 2028. Kaliningrad Oblast became Russian territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The strategic exclave is home to the Russian Baltic Fleet.	https://kyivindependent.com/advisor-to-putin-accuses-west-of-isolating-kaliningrad-by-disrupting-transit-links/	2024-09-28T05:18:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151387932.jpg

As Russian losses in Ukraine surge, some military bloggers turn on Kremlin, military command	The Kremlin is facing a backlash from Russian military bloggers outraged at reports of specialist troops being sent to storm Ukrainian positions in order to maintain pressure on the front lines. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; a U.K. Military Intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day, and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion was &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; &quot;It is expected that Russia&apos;s casualty rate will average more than 1,000 per day throughout September, as their soldiers are needlessly (killed) or wounded,&quot; it added. As the losses mount, some pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers (milbloggers) are accusing authorities of ignoring an apparently widespread practice of using specialist troops as cannon fodder in mass infantry attacks. &quot;Specialists, the handicapped, wounded, and so on are sent to storm one way, and in some cases they will not even make it to the assault &#x2014; a needless death,&quot; prominent milblogger Anastasia Kashevarova said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 24. The bodies of killed Russian soldiers in the Bakhmut area in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on June 29, 2024 (Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Despite hopes that Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast would divert and slow Russian forces, Moscow&apos;s troops continue to make grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, leveraging in particular its advantage in manpower. &quot;Their tactics never change: they attack with quantity, and we fight them off with quality,&quot; one soldier defending the embattled town of Pokrovsk told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. &quot;If we had that many people, that much ammunition, we would have fought all of them off a long time ago, but instead, we have shortages.&quot; Steven Wolff, Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s huge losses are indicative of a Russian military mindset that has not changed in decades. &quot;Russian military doctrine is Soviet-style, and it always relied on the depth of Russia and its enormous resources, including manpower resources,&quot; he said. &quot;The way in which Stalin just threw millions of people at the Nazis in the 1940s, it&apos;s not very different to what (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does in this terrible war of aggression against Ukraine.&quot; In order to sustain this pool of manpower, Putin earlier this month signed a decree increasing the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000, to just under 2.4 million. The Russian milblogger community has recently been highlighting numerous cases where skilled and specialized troops have been sent to the front in order to maintain the levels of men required to keep up pressure at the front. Russian milblogger Roman Alekhine has described incidents in which Russian special forces officers, Aerospace Forces, and even sailors were being used to storm Ukrainian positions. &quot;Oh, yes, and rocket scientists too,&quot; he claimed in a post on his Telegram channel. &quot;And if&#x2026; they died in vain then it depends on us &#x2014; bloggers, military correspondents, journalists&#x2026; to convey to the Defense Ministry and the Supreme Council the information about systemic problems at the front.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military has also noted a recent increase in specialist Russian troops taking part in infantry assaults. Speaking to Espresso TV on Sept. 5, a commander with the 60th Brigade&apos;s 97th Battalion said waves of repelled assaults using &quot;young and inexperienced soldiers&quot; in the Lyman sector had led to large losses for Russian forces. &quot;New reinforcements have not yet arrived, so the enemy is forced to use trained and well-equipped special forces units for assaults,&quot; he added. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) also reported on the trend on Sept. 24, saying the &quot;systematic misuse of Russian specialists&#x2026; indicates that Russia is struggling to meet the manpower demands of its war in Ukraine.&quot; Russian military cadets take part in a rehearsal of next May 9&apos;s 79th anniversary military parade celebrating Soviet Union&apos;s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, on April 23, 2024 (Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;Compounding the high levels of losses, a recent scandal exposed the apparently common practice of transferring skilled and specialized troops to assault units and, in many cases, their deaths as punishment. Earlier this month, two Russian reconnaissance drone specialists Dmitriy Lysakovskiy and Sergey Gritsay &#x2014; call signs &quot;Goodwin&quot; and &quot;Ernest&quot; &#x2014;recorded a video in which they said their unit was being punished for reporting accurate information about the situation on the front lines. &quot;The entire long-range UAV drone unit was destroyed so that we&apos;d stop receiving actual front line information, and sent into the assault,&quot; one of the men says in the video, adding: &quot;Our regiment commander &apos;Zloy&apos; already reported the capture of Lesovka, and obviously it&apos;s a lie. It&apos;s not taken.&quot; &quot;This situation is not unique, it happens all across the front line. Lies are an absolute norm. It&apos;s normal to lie about capturing places,&quot; he adds. &quot;And I record this because there is a high chance I won&apos;t return from this assault.&quot; Both men were reportedly killed by a drone while storming Ukrainian positions. A very curious incident occurred for Russians in the Pokrovsk direction. We&apos;ve all heard when Russians send specialists like UAV operators and tankmen into meat assaults. In this case, one operator recorded a video before his death...1/ pic.twitter.com/b893g7mF3w The video gained traction among Russian milbloggers, prompting many to raise similar cases. The milblogger North Channel said the practice &quot;continues everywhere,&quot; while one of the most popular Russian milbloggers Rybar said it was endemic, and &quot;scoundrel commanders remain in power while truth-telling soldiers and officers die.&quot; &quot;Note that all this is not happening in some backwater where the army could fall apart, but in the most important direction, in the Pokrovsk area (where) the success of the entire strategic campaign of the Russian Armed Forces depends right now,&quot; another milblogger, artjockey, said on Telegram. &quot;There is no more important place on the entire front right now,&quot; they added. Such was the outcry that Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov initiated an investigation into the case of Goodwin and Ernest, the preliminary results of which were reported by a milblogger Alexander Kots earlier this week. According to his report, the investigation found Goodwin and Ernest&apos;s commander did nothing wrong by disbanding their drone unit and sending them to the front as infantry. Many milbloggers reacted to the report with fury, with one saying authorities were &quot;not interested either in an objective investigation of this particular case, or in correcting the situation in the army.&quot; But Wolff expects little to change, in large part because of a lack of outcry among the Russian public. &quot;There&apos;s also a particular mindset that makes that possible, where the Russian population just goes along with it because that&apos;s what they&apos;ve always done,&quot; he said. &quot;You can go back all the way to the Napoleonic wars, there&apos;s just an enormous capacity for suffering, and that doesn&apos;t excuse it, but it just makes it so much more acceptable in a way.&quot; A February poll from the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, found that 77% of Russians supported the full-scale war in Ukraine, but a more recent survey suggests there may have been a shift in public mood in the months since. According to polls conducted by independent pollsters ExtremeScan and Chronicles in September 2024, 49% of Russians support the immediate withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and peace talks with Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russian-losses-in-ukraine-surge-some-military-bloggers-turn-on-kremlin-military-command/	2024-09-28T03:55:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151934692.jpg

Russian double-tap attack on Sumy hospital kills 6, injures 1, interior minister says	Russian forces launched a double-tap strike on a hospital in the northeastern city of Sumy, killing six people and injuring another, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Sept. 28. The initial attack claimed one life and caused extensive damage to several floors of the hospital, according to Klymenko. The second strike hit as rescuers and police arrived to evacuate patients to safety. &#x201C;As of now, six people are known to have died, including a policeman. Another policeman was wounded,&#x201D; Klymenko said in a Telegram post. The regional military administration reported that Russian troops targeted the healthcare facility around 8:30 a.m. local time with an airstrike and Shahed drones. About 10 minutes later, the Air Force confirmed Russian forces had also deployed powerful KAB-guided bombs in Sumy Oblast. In his Sept. 28 update, Klymenko noted it was the second consecutive day that Ukrainian police had suffered casualties. He added that search efforts were ongoing in Kryvyi Rih, where another worker might still be trapped beneath the rubble. For more than two years, Russia has indiscriminately attacked civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, striking hospitals, schools, and residential buildings in a campaign seemingly designed to erode the nation&#x2019;s morale. Since Ukraine&apos;s surprise cross-border operation into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in August, launched from Sumy Oblast, the fighting has intensified around Sumy. The region had seen relative calm following Russia&#x2019;s withdrawal in the early months of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-double-tap-attack-on-sumy-hospital-kills-6-injures-1-interior-minister-says/	2024-09-28T00:56:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-09-28-10_59_28.jpg

Blinken criticizes China's Ukraine peace proposals following meeting with his counterpart	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed strong U.S. concerns to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sept. 27 regarding China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry, saying that Beijing&apos;s claims of seeking peace in Ukraine &quot;don&apos;t add up.&quot; During their meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Blinken also criticized China&apos;s &quot;dangerous and destabilizing actions&quot; in the South China Sea and emphasized the need for improved communication between their militaries, Reuters reported. At a press conference, Blinken said that he and Wang also discussed strategies to curb the flow of drugs into the U.S. and addressed the risks associated with artificial intelligence. Blinken highlighted that approximately 70 percent of the machine tools and 90 percent of the microelectronics Russia is importing come from China and Hong Kong. That was materially helping Moscow to produce the missiles, rockets, armored vehicles and munitions needed to perpetuate its war, he said. &quot;So when Beijing says that, on the one hand, it wants peace, it wants to see an end to the conflict, but on the other hand, is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping (Vladimir) Putin continue the aggression, that doesn&apos;t add up,&quot; Blinked said. Wang said his country&apos;s position on the war in Ukraine had always emphasized the need for peace through talks, China&apos;s foreign ministry said in a statement.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-criticizes-chinas-ukraine-peace-proposals-following-beijing-meeting/	2024-09-27T18:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
Over 71,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, media report suggests	More than 71,000 Russian soldiers have been confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine amid the full-scale war, according to a report by independent Russian media outlet Mediazona on Sept. 27. Mediazona, along with BBC News Russian, has been documenting the names of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine through open-source research. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in mid-September, the names of 1,998 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,100 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 13,175 Russian inmates have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. According to the journalist, a surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. The last few month, amid the renewed Kharkiv offensive as well as Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. According to undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17 that roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded since February 2022 - including civillians. The WSJ also claimed that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the war and around 400,000 wounded - a number some Ukrainian lawmakers have rebuked as &quot;exaggerated.&quot; In February of this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 180,000 Russian troops had been killed since the start of the all-out war. The president said that over 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed during the same time. Western officials gave similar estimates about Russian battlefield losses. As of Sept. 27, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 649,170 troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-71-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-media-report-suggests/	2024-09-27T16:05:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Paraguay becomes 95th country to join global peace summit communique, Zelensky says	Paraguay formally signed the global peace summit joint communique on Sept. 27, becoming the 95th country to add their signature onto the final communique, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. Switzerland hosted Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit on June 15-16, with representatives of around 100 countries and organizations in attendance. Seventy-eight states and four organizations signed the final joint communique of the peace summit on June 16. Since then, multiple countries signed on the ever-expanding list of delegations. &quot;One more South American country has endorsed our Peace Formula, the UN Charter, and our vision for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, adding that he was &quot;looking forward to further deepening political dialogue&quot; with more South American countries. The communique called to return the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant under full control of Ukraine, ensure uninterrupted manufacturing and supply of food products in Ukraine, secure full access to sea ports in the Black and Azov Seas, release all prisoners of war and return all deported Ukrainian children, among other things. Russia was not invited to join the inaugural global peace summit in June. Kyiv is planning to arrange the second global peace summit before the end of 2024, which Ukraine hopes will be held in either the Middle East or India. Despite hopes that Russia will participate in a second peace summit, Moscow has repeatedly signalled it will not take part in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit.	https://kyivindependent.com/paraguay-becomes-95th-country-to-join-global-peace-summit-communique-zelensky-says/	2024-09-27T14:08:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/95177401e8873a3c1d40e58aa4f8bf30_1702214719_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine launches program allowing foreigners to remotely start businesses in Ukraine	Ukraine has launched uResidency, a program enabling foreigners to start a business in the country remotely, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Sept. 27 at the Lviv IT Arena, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist reporting from the event. The program offers foreign entrepreneurs favorable conditions for conducting business, including a 5% tax on profits, the ability to register remotely as individual entrepreneurs, and the ability to conduct business through a mobile application and website. Kyiv has long sought to open business opportunities as it seeks to regain economic investments and rebuild entrepreneurial opportunities lost throughout the duration of the war. &quot;Thanks to technology, we can create products that can attract funds to Ukraine and grow the brand of an innovative country. One of these products is the uResidency,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;This is a revolutionary project that will not only offer foreigners a great service for doing business in Ukraine but also support the Ukrainian economy. There are only a few similar projects in the world.&quot; Despite what the name implies, no additional pathways for permanent residency in Ukraine are provided. Foreigners do not need to travel to Ukraine to obtain &quot;e-residency status&quot;. To do this, they just need to undergo a one-time offline verification at the Ukrainian consular office in their country of residence. Subsequently, this procedure will also take place online. The uResidency was implemented with the support of the European Union through projects implemented by the eGovernance Academy of Estonia. The uResidency members are also not required to handle financial accounting on their own, as the bank will do it for them as a tax agent The program is currently available to citizens of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Slovenia. The first phase is expected to involve about 1,000 e-residents. According to Fedorov, the list of countries will be expanded in the future. The Digital Transformation Ministry continues to work towards the concept of &quot;the state in a smartphone,&quot; which was established in 2020 with the launch of the Diia app - a state mobile application for government services. Ukrainians can access digitized versions of various official documents, including their passport, driver&apos;s license, vehicle registration, or tax ID. It is also possible to do things like register a business or the birth of one&apos;s child on the app.Last year, President Zelensky announced that Ukraine was helping other countries in Europe, Latin America, and Africa to develop the equivalent of Diia.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreigners-to-become-e-residents-start-business-in-ukraine-remotely-digital-transformation-ministry-announces/	2024-09-27T12:47:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/tech.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky meets with Trump in New York, shows him his 'victory plan'	Key developments on Sept. 27: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said everything possible must be done to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky made the remarks on Sept. 27 after meeting with Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York City. &quot;This war should not have started. I think that the problem is that Putin killed so many people, and of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war,&quot; Zelensky said in a joint interview with Trump for Fox News. Zelensky met with Trump for the first time in five years during his trip to the U.S., where he held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, and addressed the U.N. General Assembly. Ukraine&apos;s president also introduced Trump to his &quot;victory plan,&quot; which he had presented a day earlier to U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Following his meeting with Trump, Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine seeks only a just peace and relies on continued U.S. support in the ongoing full-scale war launched by Russia. Trump said he has &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed. &quot;The president (Zelensky) wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place,&quot; Trump said. &quot;If I win (in the presidential election), we&apos;re going to have a very fair and, I think, rather rapid deal. It (the war) should stop, and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I&apos;m sure President Putin wants it to stop. And that&apos;s a good combination,&quot; Trump added. When asked how he sees the war ending, Trump evaded the question, saying it was &quot;too early&quot; to discuss and that both he and Zelensky had their &quot;own ideas&quot; on the matter. Zelensky and Trump did not disclose whether another meeting between them would take place soon. However, the Ukrainian president invited the Republican nominee to visit Ukraine, and Trump accepted the invitation. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become more critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican leaders on Sept. 25 also accused Zelensky of interfering in the election by visiting an ammunition factory in U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s hometown of Scranton, Pennyslvania, a hotly contested battleground state. House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded that Zelensky fire Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Makarovka, for her role in arranging the tour. The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee also announced he was opening an investigation into the Biden-Harris administration&apos;s alleged misuse of government funds. Zelensky criticized Trump&apos;s plans for an end to the war in an interview with the New Yorker earlier this week. He called Trump&apos;s running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance, &quot;too radical&quot; and said the war should not end at Ukraine&apos;s expense. Russia is attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps, it was reported on Sept. 27. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, the metal structures have been put in place using barges and a floating crane for the last month. An unverified photo accompanying the post showed a barge pulling what resembles a large section of metal fencing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but it comes a day after Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge. &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he added. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Ukraine is reported to have been testing an underwater sea drone dubbed Marichka, but scant details have been made public. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot; U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned that Russia may respond with increased force, potentially including lethal attacks on the U.S. and its allies, if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles supplied by the U.S., U.K., and France for strikes deep into Russian territory, the New York Times reported. The news outlet cited a previously unreported assessment that also downplays the strategic impact these long-range missiles might have on the war, mentioning Ukraine&apos;s limited supply and the uncertainty over how many more Western nations may provide those missiles. The analysis underscores the significant risks and uncertain benefits of the decision, which now lies with President Joe Biden, following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Sept. 26. The difficulty in President Biden&apos;s decision-making on Ukraine&apos;s request for long-range missiles is partly rooted in concerns highlighted by U.S. intelligence, American officials told the New York Times. Zelensky has been pushing both publicly and privately to gain permission to target Russian territory with the advanced missiles. Vladimir Putin has regularly used threats to deter the U.S. and its allies from sending more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine. Critics argue that Biden&#x2019;s administration has been overly cautious, claiming their slow, incremental approach to arming Ukraine has hurt their performance on the battlefield. On the other hand, supporters of the current strategy point to its effectiveness in avoiding major Russian retaliation, though they admit this balance may now be at risk. The intelligence assessment outlines a range of potential Russian reactions if the U.S. and European nations authorize Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes with their supplied missiles. These responses could include increased acts of sabotage and arson targeting infrastructure across Europe, and even potentially lethal attacks on military installations belonging to the U.S. and its allies. According to U.S. officials, most of the sabotage in Europe so far has been orchestrated by Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU). If Putin opts to escalate this covert campaign in response to missile strikes deep inside Russian territory, officials believe the Kremlin would likely continue to operate in the shadows, avoiding direct and open attacks on U.S. and European military facilities to prevent triggering a broader conflict. Kyiv did not conduct a Qatar-brokered &quot;exchange&quot; of children with Moscow, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 27. Lubinets refuted an AFP report citing an unnamed Qatari official who claimed nine children and one adult had allegedly returned to Ukraine, while four children &quot;will be reunited with their families in Russia.&quot; under the agreement. According to the ombudsman, no deals were made between the two countries and the reports are &quot;promoting Russian narratives.&quot; Qatar has acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. International humanitarian law does not provide for such a process as the exchange of children, Lubinets said. &quot;Ukraine has not kidnapped and does not hold Russian children on its territory, nor does it prevent their return to Russia if they are on our territory,&quot; he added. Over 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. An attack on Belarus would lead to World War III, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Sept. 27, following Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s call to update Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine, according to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta. Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine on Sept. 25 during a Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. He also stated that Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack, including if an enemy using conventional weapons poses a critical threat to Russia and Belarus. &quot;An attack on Belarus is World War III,&quot; Lukashenko said. &quot;Putin recently confirmed this by amending the nuclear doctrine, that in an attack on Russia and Belarus, we use nuclear weapons,&quot; Lukashenko added, thanking his Russian counterpart for the recent move. The Belarusian dictator claimed that NATO countries had allegedly deployed troops on the border with Belarus, specifically in Poland. &quot;The red line is the state border. If you step on it, there will be an immediate response. We are preparing for that,&quot; Lukashenko said. Russia&apos;s decision to modify its nuclear doctrine is a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about whether to allow Ukraine to launch conventional Western missiles into Russian territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Sept. 26 that updates had been made to a document titled &quot;The Foundations of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; While Belarus doesn&apos;t have nuclear weapons of its own, Russia has allegedly moved some of its nuclear arsenal to Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-meets-trump-presents-him-victory-plan-in-new-york-city/	2024-09-27T12:08:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg
Serhii Sukhomlyn named head of Ukraine's Agency for Restoration and Development of Infrastructure	Former Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn has been appointed head of the Agency for the Restoration and Development of Infrastructure, he announced on Facebook on Sept. 27. Sukhomlyn became mayor of Zhytomyr in November 2015 and resigned at his own request in early September 2024. Before Sukhomlyn, Mustafa Nayyem headed the agency specializing in Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. Nayyem resigned on June 10 after being prevented from attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference scheduled for June 11-12 in Berlin. In a lengthy Facebook post, he outlined a series of complaints about &quot;systemic obstacles&quot; that limited his ability to do his job, ultimately leading to his decision to resign. Nayyem&apos;s resignation and reshuffles strained relations between Kyiv and Western allies, raising concerns about Ukraine&apos;s ability to address the ongoing attacks on its energy infrastructure by Russia, the Financial Times reported on June 10, citing unnamed Ukrainian and Western officials. Nayyem is also credited as one of the first activists to call for demonstrations in Kyiv in November 2013, marking the beginning of the protest movement that culminated in the EuroMaidan Revolution.	https://kyivindependent.com/government-appoints-new-infrastructure-development-head-after-controversial-predecessors-resignation/	2024-09-27T11:13:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1221786684.jpg

India won't buy from sanctioned Russian Arctic LNG 2 project, Indian oil secretary says	India will not purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia&apos;s Arctic LNG 2 project, which has been sanctioned by Western countries, Indian Oil Secretary Pankaj Jain said on Sept. 27, Reuters reported. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&#x2019;s Novatek, aims to produce nearly 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, primarily for Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. The project was envisioned as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a key part of its plan to become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer. Earlier this year, the U.K., along with the U.S. and the European Union, sanctioned Arctic LNG 2. &quot;We will not buy (from) Arctic LNG 2. We are not buying any sanctioned commodity. Something which has broad-based sanctions, we are not touching it,&quot; Jain said. India has maintained close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a record high in 2023. India overtook China as the world&#x2019;s largest importer of Russian oil in July as Chinese refiners bought less due to lower profit margins from fuel production, Reuters reported on Aug. 22, citing a comparison of import data. At the same time, India has been developing its relationship with Ukraine, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting Kyiv in August, the first time an Indian prime minister set foot in Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established over 30 years ago. Modi&apos;s visit to Ukraine came just weeks after his trip to Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/india-wont-buy-from-sanctioned-russian-arctic-lng-2-project-indian-oil-secretary-says/	2024-09-27T07:34:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1013825882.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko admits to decade-long cooperation with occupied Donetsk	In a meeting with a top Russian militant, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko admits to a decade-long cooperation with occupied Donetsk and complicity in hosting abducted Ukrainian children. The U.S. condemns Belarusian state-owned TV channel for broadcasting &#x201C;repentance&#x201D; of U.S. citizen turned Belarusian political prisoner Yury Ziankovich. Far-right German politician J&#xF6;rg Dornau accused of using jailed Belarusian activists for cheap labor at his onion plantation in Belarus. European Parliament adopts new resolution on Belarusian political prisoners, urges Serbia not to extradite the Belarusian activist at the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s request. Austria&#x2019;s Raiffeisen Bank agrees to sell its stake in its Belarusian subsidiary to UAE investors, marking a full exit from the Belarusian market. International Chess Federation FIDE reaffirms the ban on the participation of Russia and Belarus in its tournaments. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has admitted to cooperating with the proxy authorities in Ukraine&#x2019;s Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast for over a decade, also reaffirmed his complicity in hosting children abducted by Russia from occupied Ukrainian territories. Lukashenko made the remarks during a meeting in Minsk on Sept. 19 with Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-installed leader of the Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. While Minsk hasn&#x2019;t formally recognized Russia&apos;s claim to have annexed the occupied territories of Ukraine, Lukashenko claimed that Belarus &#x201C;has always cooperated&#x201D; with occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast &#x201C;for the past ten years.&#x201D; The Belarusian dictator also admitted to hosting Ukrainian children abducted by the Russian authorities while claiming the abductions were for the purpose of &#x201C;recreation.&#x201D; &#x201C;We host your children for treatment and recreation,&#x201D; Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office quoted him as telling Pushilin. &#x201C;However, they threatened me with legal action for allegedly stealing your children. So I told both Ukraine and the United States, &#x2018;Please come and find at least one stolen child. It runs contrary to our principles.&#x2019;&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry condemned the meeting and &#x201C;Lukashenko&#x2019;s hypocritical rhetoric,&#x201D; underscoring the dependency of Belarus&#x2019; policies on the Kremlin. &#x201C;The stance of the current Belarus authorities with regard to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is being dictated exclusively by the Kremlin and has nothing to do either with international law or the international obligations of the Republic of Belarus,&#x201D; the Ukrainian ministry&#x2019;s statement reads. This was Pushilin&#x2019;s third visit to Belarus. Following the previous meeting of the two on April 18, 2023, in Minsk, Ukraine recalled its Ambassador, Ihor Kyzym, for consultations. Kyzym did not return to the Belarusian capital and was appointed Ambassador-at-Large to support Kyiv&#x2019;s dialogue with the Belarusian opposition in exile. Belarus, a close Kremlin ally, has been involved in the abduction of Ukrainian children from the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Belarus officials have repeatedly confirmed their participation in the abductions, while describing the deportations as &#x201C;recuperation trips.&#x201D; According to official estimates, Russia has abducted over 20,000 children from the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, although the true number is likely much higher. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children&#x2019;s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for their role in organizing the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. The European Parliament has called on the ICC to issue a similar arrest warrant against Lukashenko for his complicity in the crime. Several human rights organizations, including Freedom House, Ukraine&apos;s Regional Human Rights Center, and Ukraine&#x2019;s Zmina Human Rights Center, have announced that they submitted to the ICC on Sept. 23 new evidence of the abduction, brainwashing, and militarizing of more than 2,219 children from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. The U.S. charge d&apos;affaires at the embassy in Minsk, Peter Kaufman, has condemned a Belarusian state-owned TV channel&apos;s broadcasting of a documentary featuring U.S.-Belarusian citizen and political prisoner Yury Ziankovich. During the broadcast, Ziankovich was shown pleading for help from U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. &#x201C;I resolutely condemn the Belarusian regime&#x2019;s reprehensible showing of a detained U.S. citizen on state media for propaganda purposes, and refute the baseless claims made in the program, &quot; reads a statement issued by Kaufman on Sep. 20. &#x201C;The regime&apos;s history of using coercive tactics to produce content like this strongly calls into question the voluntary nature of the U.S. citizen&apos;s participation.&#x201D; Kaufman reiterated the U.S. government&apos;s long-standing advice to U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to Belarus. The statement was released after the airing on Sep. 19 of the film, titled &#x201C;Murderous Conspiracy,&#x201D; on Belarusian television. It shows U.S.-Belarusian citizen and lawyer, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on trumped-up charges of conspiracy to seize power, appealing to Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon, as well as pleading to candidates Harris and Trump to help him return to his family in Houston, Texas. Filmed in prison, Ziankovich is said to have lost a significant amount of weight. Likely under duress, in the film he &#x201C;confesses&#x201D; to conspiring to seize power and gives details of alleged plans to overthrow the Lukashenko regime. The documentary aired as 115 Belarusian political prisoners &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; by Lukashenko were released. According to Belarusian political analyst Valer Karbalevich, the broadcast was a &#x201C;bargaining offer to Washington&#x201D; from Lukashenko, who is likely testing the West&apos;s readiness for negotiations with his regime. As Lukashenko signed the fourth round of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; releasing dozens of Belarusian political prisoners, his propaganda mouthpiece, Yury Vaskrasenski, urged &#x201C;the West (to have) discussions&#x201D; so that the process could continue. Over 1,300 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus following Lukashenko&#x2019;s four-year-long crackdown on dissent after the 2020 presidential election, which he claimed to have won but which was condemned by observers as neither free nor fair. J&#xF6;rg Dornau, a member of Saxony&#x2019;s State Parliament from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), uses Belarusian convicts &#x2013; including those jailed on political charges &#x2013; as labor on his onion plantation in Belarus, the independent Belarusian news outlet Reform.by claimed on Sept. 24. According to the outlet&#x2019;s investigation, Dornau&#x2019;s firm, Zybulka Bel, an agriculture company cultivating several hundred hectares planted with onions, signed a contract with the local Center for the Isolation of Offenders in Lida in western Belarus. As the Lukashenko regime ramped up the repressions against civil society following the disputed 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, the Centers for Isolation of Offenders have regularly held Belarusians sentenced to days of administrative arrest on politically motivated grounds. According to Human Rights Center Viasna, around 30,000 Belarusians underwent detention in 2020 alone. One of the laborers at Dornau&#x2019;s farm, sentenced to 15 days of arrest for liking an online post critical of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, described the working conditions as harsh. For 5 euros ($5.60) per day, the detainees sorted onions in an underground warehouse in freezing temperatures. The working day commenced at 7 a.m. and finished at 6 p.m. with no breaks or meals provided. According to the report, the labor was not forced; Dornau&#x2019;s foreman collected signed consent forms for daily work and monitored the quality of the labor performed. The funds prisoners earned were reportedly used to cover the costs of their detention. As of 2023, the cost of administrative arrest that prisoners are obliged to pay is roughly $5.70 per day. Dornau himself is claimed to have inspected the work of the farm in person at least once, with one prisoner describing a visit by a &#x201C;tall, bald man&#x201D; similar to Dornau arriving in a German-registered car. Dornau&#x2019;s press office has declined to comment on Reform.by&#x2019;s report. Dornau established Zybulka Bel&#x2019;s operations in Belarus in October 2020 while nationwide pro-democracy protests were still sweeping the streets of Belarus. His business relations with Belarus were not revealed until April 2024. While conducting business is not prohibited for members of parliament under Saxony&#x2019;s legislation, Dornau was fined 20,862 euros for failing to disclose his economic interests. The European Union has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Belarus for the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s ongoing human rights violations and its complicity with Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine. The European Parliament issued a resolution on Belarusian political prisoners on Sept. 19, calling on Serbia to refrain from extraditing Belarusian activist Andrey Hnyot, and noting that the Belarusian regime was abusing Interpol&#x2019;s arrest warrant system. Detained in October 2023 under an Interpol &#x201C;Red Notice&#x201D; international arrest warrant, Hnyot has for a year been battling in the Serbian courts to avoid being extradited to Belarus, where, he claims, he would face prison and torture. While the Serbian Appeals Court recently ordered a retrial, the risk of his eventual extradition remains. MEPs also expressed concern that the estimated 300,000 Belarusians who have fled Belarus since 2020 now risk political persecution in absentia. The EU parliament resolution, adopted with 549 votes in favor, 21 against, and 37 abstentions, demands that the Belarusian authorities unconditionally release all political prisoners, and provide lawyers, family members, and the Red Cross access to the most prominent political prisoners held incommunicado for over a year. It also calls for further sanctions against those involved in organizing repression in Belarus. Following the disputed 2020 presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, mass protests erupted across Belarus. The protests were met by a violent government crackdown, leading to mass arrests and detentions of over 65,000 Belarusians. Human rights organizations say some 1,300 political prisoners are now behind bars, and around 300,000 Belarusians are in exile.

The deal, reached after six months of negotiations and first announced on Feb. 14, is now subject to regulatory approval. Upon completion, the deal will mark RBI&#x2019;s full exit from the Belarusian market, reducing &#x201C;operational complexity in line with its risk mitigation strategy in Eastern Europe,&#x201D; as per a press release from the bank. RBI expects to suffer a loss of around EUR 300 million ($335 million), which it said &#x201C;essentially results from the difference between the purchase price and the book value of the equity of Priorbank.&#x201D; The last major Western bank remaining in Russia and Belarus &#x2013; the Kremlin&#x2019;s accomplice in its aggressive war against Ukraine &#x2013; RBI has come under heavy criticism from Western institutions for continuing to do business in Russia and Belarus, and thus indirectly financing Russia&#x2019;s war by paying taxes to those countries. The General Assembly of the International Chess Federation FIDE voted on Sept. 22 to uphold a ban on chess teams from Russia and Belarus competing in international events. FIDE banned both countries from its events in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and prohibited holding any of its events on Russian and Belarusian territory. However, individual Russian and Belarusian players were allowed to participate under the neutral FIDE flag. During a meeting in Budapest, 21 delegates supported lifting the ban, whereas 41 countries voted not to admit players at all. With 66 votes in favor, the federation supported a last-minute proposal to consult the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow some Russian and Belarusian disabled and junior teams to participate in international chess events. The FIDE Council still has to approve the decision, although there is no expectation that it will be overturned. The proposal to reinstate Russia and Belarus&#x2019; participation in FIDE tournaments was made on June 5 by the Kyrgyz Chess Federation. It provided no arguments to support its proposal. Ahead of the General Assembly of the International Chess Federation, 13 Ukrainian chess players sent a letter to FIDE supporting the ban of Russian and Belarusian players from competitions due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. During FIDE&#x2019;s Greatest Of All Time award in Budapest, the award&#x2019;s winner, Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, spoke against reinstating the Russian and Belarusian chess federations.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-admits-to-decade-long-cooperation-with-occupied-donetsk/	2024-09-27T05:55:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Ukraine's Achilles drone strike battalion releases video of failed Russian assault in Kharkiv Oblast	A Russian assault near the village of Pishchane in Kharkiv Oblast was repelled, and dozens of vehicles damaged and destroyed, the Achilles drone strike battalion of Ukraine&apos;s 92nd Separate Special Forces Brigade claimed on Sept. 27. Commander Yurii Fedosenko said Moscow&apos;s forces had attempted to advance toward Kolesnykivka and Kruhliakivka the previous day, using around 50 armored vehicles and troops. Footage shared by Fedosenko show repeated Ukrainian FPV drone strikes on Russian vehicles which reportedly destroyed 14, and damaged 26 pieces of Russian military equipment, including infantry fighting vehicles and tanks. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Pishchane is located some 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the town of Kupiansk in eastern Kharkiv Oblast. Twenty engagements took place in the Kupiansk sector over the past day, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. 0:00/1&#xD7;Another Russian attack was repelled in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s 79th Tavrian Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 22. This week, Ukrainian forces also recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. The intensity of fighting in the area has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repels-russian-attack/	2024-09-27T04:57:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-27-141103.png
Crimean bridge defenses being bolstered by underwater drone traps, according to reports	Russia is attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps, it was reported on Sept. 27. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, the metal structures have been put in place using barges and a floating crane for the last month. An unverified photo accompanying the post showed a barge pulling what resembles a large section of metal fencing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but it comes a day after Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge. &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he added. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Ukraine is reported to have been testing an underwater sea drone dubbed Marichka, but scant details have been made public. &#x26A1;&#xFE0F;More detailed footage showing the design and appearance of the Marichka underwater multi-purpose drone developed by &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;Ukrainian inventors pic.twitter.com/NQBDzgtEWf The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-bridge-defenses-being-bolstered-by-metal-drone-traps-media-reports/	2024-09-27T04:15:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-09-27-13_56_44.jpg
Top Orban aide sparks outrage by calling Ukraine's resistance to Russia's full-scale invasion 'irresponsible'	A top aide of Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has criticized Ukraine&apos;s resistance to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, calling it &quot;irresponsible&quot; and suggesting his country would have advised against fighting back if it had been asked. Balazs Orban &#x2013; no relation to the prime minister &#x2013; made the comments when discussing Hungary&apos;s anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 which was brutally put down by the Red Army. &quot;Considering 1956, we would have probably not done what President Zelensky did 2.5 years ago, as it is irresponsible, as we can see that he led his country into a defensive war, many lives were lost and territories lost,&quot; he said in an interview published Sept. 26. &quot;Let me say again, it is (Ukraine&apos;s) right and sovereign decision... but had they asked us, we would have not recommended this, based on what happened in 1956.&quot; In a post on Facebook, Hungary&apos;s leading opposition figure Peter Magyar said the aide &quot;has no place in public life after his scandalous and traitorous comments.&quot; Speaking on national radio on Sept. 27, in comments reported by Reuters, Orban claimed his aide&apos;s words were an error and emphasized that people should speak &quot;very carefully and clearly&quot; on such matters. &quot;Now my political director made an ambiguous statement which is a mistake, as our community stands on the basis of the 1956 revolution has grown from it,&quot; he said. Hungary is widely regarded as a key ally of Russia in the EU. Orban has repeatedly blocked aid to Ukraine, pushed for negotiations, and frequently spouted Kremlin talking points. Hungary has also condemned the war but has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons. Since taking the presidency of the European Commission in July, Orban has amped up attempts to stand as a negotiator between Moscow and Kyiv. In July, he embarked on a &#x201C;peace tour&#x201D; and met with Russian dictator Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Orban&apos;s visits sparked criticism from the EU and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The latter said that NATO and the EU can resolve the war without Orban. In early July, Hungary quietly changed the rules for its National Card program to allow Russian and Belarusian &quot;guest workers&quot; to enter the country in a streamlined visa-acquisition process that does away with enhanced security checks or other restrictions. In response to the policy change, European parliamentarians published a letter urging parliament to reconsider Hungary&apos;s Schengen membership. Earlier on Aug. 22, Ukrainian refugees from southwestern Zakarpattia Oblast began being evicted from shelters after in Hungary after the government passed a decree to restrict housing assistance for Ukrainians fleeing their country.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-orban-aide-sparks-outrage-by-calling-ukraine-resistance-to-russian-invasion-irresponsible/	2024-09-27T03:03:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169793556.jpg
Ombudsman denies reports on Qatar-brokered Ukraine-Russia deal on 'children exchange'	Kyiv did not conduct a Qatar-brokered &quot;exchange&quot; of children with Moscow, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 27. Lubinets refuted an AFP report citing an unnamed Qatari official who claimed nine children and one adult had allegedly returned to Ukraine, while four children &quot;will be reunited with their families in Russia.&quot; under the agreement. According to the ombudsman, no deals were made between the two countries and the reports are &quot;promoting Russian narratives.&quot; Qatar has acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. International humanitarian law does not provide for such a process as the exchange of children, Lubinets said. &quot;Ukraine has not kidnapped and does not hold Russian children on its territory, nor does it prevent their return to Russia if they are on our territory,&quot; he added. Over 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database.	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsmen-denies-reports-on-qatar-brokered-ukraine-russia-deal-on-children-exchange/	2024-09-27T02:31:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1752126674.jpg
Russian missile hits administrative building in Kryvyi Rih, governor says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A Russian missile attack has struck an administrative building in the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on Sept. 27. People may be trapped under the rubble, Lysak said. There is no further information on casualties at this time. An explosion was reported in Kryvyi Rih almost immediately after an air raid alert went off. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. It has suffered multiple deadly attacks by Russian forces since the outbreak of the full-scale war. At least 53 people were injured in the Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih on July 8. The strike also killed 10 people, local authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-hits-administrative-building-in-kryvyi-rih/	2024-09-27T00:04:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241638872.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 49 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed eight people and injured at least 49 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 27. Ukrainian forces downed 24 out of 32 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. One more drone was &quot;lost,&quot; and another entered Romanian airspace, it added. Russia also fired a North Korean Iskander M/KN-23 missile and two Kh-22 cruise missiles at Ukraine, the statement said. Russian drones attacked the town of Izmail in southern Odesa Oblast, killing three people and injuring at least 11, including a child, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Two women born in 1934 and 1955 as well as a 73-year-old man were killed. The attack damaged houses, apartment buildings, and cars, causing several fires that were put out, according to the governor. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast overnight on Sept. 27, 2024. (Oleh Kiper/Telegram)Two people were killed in the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were killed in the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Siversk. A total of 11 people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, Filashkin added. A Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv injured three women and two men, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three men, aged 77, 74 and 46, suffered injuries after Russian attacks on Kupiansk, Vuzlovyi, Vovchansk and Ivashky in Kharkiv Oblast. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 19 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-8-injure-49-over-past-day/	2024-09-26T23:47:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-27_09-25-04.jpg
Russia building unknown structure near Crimean Bridge, Ukraine's Navy says	Russia is building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on national television on Sept. 26. The purpose of the construction is not yet currently known for certain, Pletenchuk said, adding that it is unlikely to be completed &quot;this season.&quot; &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he said. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. The bridge connects the Russian mainland with the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula and became a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Pletenchuk said that no matter what the structure is, deteriorating weather conditions as winter approaches will make it difficult to complete. &quot;They are constantly trying to place something new in the Kerch Strait, to build various hydrotechnical or barrier structures. But periodically they end up on the shore after another storm,&quot; he said. The bridge was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Following these attacks, Russian proxies further fortified the bridge with underwater barriers. Russian proxy authorities in occupied Crimea regularly shut down traffic on the bridge amid reports of explosions and drone strikes. According to Ukraine&apos;s Navy, destroying the Crimean Bridge now would not have the same effect now because Russia barely uses it for military purposes anymore. Vasyl Maliuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), did not rule out that Russia may try to use the structure for weapons supplies again after it is fully restored. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-building-new-structure-near-kerch-bridge-in-occupied-crimea-navy-says/	2024-09-26T22:58:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1243955050.webp

Blinken to hold talks with Chinese counterpart amid worries about China's drone assistance to Russia	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sept. 27 during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This meeting between the top diplomats of both countries comes in response to increasing U.S. concerns regarding Chinese companies supplying chips and drones to Moscow, significantly enhancing Russia&apos;s military capabilities in its ongoing war against Ukraine. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has informed Congress that China&apos;s material support for Russia&apos;s war effort &quot;comes from the very top,&quot; the Voice of America (VOA) reported. Blinken&apos;s discussions with Wang will occur before a scheduled call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, anticipated later this fall. Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the U.N. General Assembly, asserting that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by other nations to conclude Russia&#x2019;s 31-month invasion, and questioned the intentions of China and Brazil in advocating for negotiations with Moscow. For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively supporting Russia&apos;s war effort. Washington has placed sanctions on Chinese firms supplying critical components to Russia&apos;s defense sector. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that the U.S. openly discusses its &quot;differences&quot; with China to ensure both countries &quot;at least understand where the other is coming from, even if we can&#x2019;t reach an agreement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-to-hold-talks-with-chinese-counterpart-amid-worries-about-chinas-drone-assistance-to-russia/	2024-09-26T21:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2158488146.jpg
Kremlin says recent adjustments to Russia's nuclear policy intended as a message to Western nations	The Kremlin on Sept. 26 emphasized that President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s revisions to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear weapons doctrine should serve as a warning to Western nations, making clear that involvement in attacks on Russia would carry serious repercussions. A day earlier, Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Russia&apos;s decision to modify its nuclear doctrine is a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about whether to allow Ukraine to launch conventional Western missiles into Russian territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that updates had been made to a document titled &quot;The Foundations of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; When asked if these changes were intended as a message to the West, Peskov said: &quot;This should be considered a definite signal.&quot; Peskov emphasized that Russia&apos;s updated nuclear doctrine serves as &quot;a signal that warns these countries about the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, and not necessarily nuclear ones.&quot; He added that the world is witnessing an &quot;unprecedented confrontation&quot; provoked by the &quot;direct involvement of Western countries, including nuclear powers,&quot; in the war in Ukraine. &quot;Russia&apos;s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and reckless,&quot; outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Council on Foreign Relations, according to Reuters. &quot;We are closely watching what Russia is doing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-recent-adjustments-to-russias-nuclear-policy-intended-as-a-message-to-western-nations/	2024-09-26T20:32:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2158007453.jpg
US intelligence warns of risks in permitting Ukraine's long-range strikes, NYT reports	U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned that Russia may respond with increased force, potentially including lethal attacks on the U.S. and its allies, if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles supplied by the U.S., U.K., and France for strikes deep into Russian territory, the New York Times reported. The news outlet cited a previously unreported assessment that also downplays the strategic impact these long-range missiles might have on the war, mentioning Ukraine&apos;s limited supply and the uncertainty over how many more Western nations may provide those missiles. The analysis underscores the significant risks and uncertain benefits of the decision, which now lies with President Joe Biden, following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Sept. 26. The difficulty in President Biden&apos;s decision-making on Ukraine&apos;s request for long-range missiles is partly rooted in concerns highlighted by U.S. intelligence, American officials told the New York Times. Zelensky has been pushing both publicly and privately to gain permission to target Russian territory with the advanced missiles. Vladimir Putin has regularly used threats to deter the U.S. and its allies from sending more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine. Critics argue that Biden&#x2019;s administration has been overly cautious, claiming their slow, incremental approach to arming Ukraine has hurt their performance on the battlefield. On the other hand, supporters of the current strategy point to its effectiveness in avoiding major Russian retaliation, though they admit this balance may now be at risk. The intelligence assessment outlines a range of potential Russian reactions if the U.S. and European nations authorize Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes with their supplied missiles. These responses could include increased acts of sabotage and arson targeting infrastructure across Europe, and even potentially lethal attacks on military installations belonging to the U.S. and its allies. According to U.S. officials, most of the sabotage in Europe so far has been orchestrated by Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU). If Putin opts to escalate this covert campaign in response to missile strikes deep inside Russian territory, officials believe the Kremlin would likely continue to operate in the shadows, avoiding direct and open attacks on U.S. and European military facilities to prevent triggering a broader conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-warns-of-risks-in-permitting-ukraines-long-range-strikes-nyt-reports/	2024-09-26T18:28:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419941.jpg
Trump says he will meet with Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York on Sept. 27	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Sept. 26 that he would meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York City on Sept. 27. The previous day, the AP reported, citing sources from Trump&apos;s campaign, that there was no meeting planned between the two. Zelensky has been in the U.S. since Sept. 22, where he has held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, as well as a visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and an address to the U.N. General Assembly. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 26, Trump shared a screenshot of a message purportedly from Zelensky on Truth Social. The message, which cannot be independently verified, reportedly carried a personal request from Zelensky to meet with Trump. &quot;Days ago, we requested a meeting with you, and I really want to hear your thoughts directly, and firsthand. You know I always speak with great respect about everything connected to you, and that&apos;s how it should be,&quot; the message read. &quot;I believe it&apos;s important for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100%.&quot; Trump announced the meeting shortly after he shared the post. During his comments to the press, Trump declined to answer if he thought that Ukraine should cede territory in exchange for peace. Senator J.D. Vance, his running mate, said earlier in September that Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time, it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added. Trump has regularly repeated that if elected, he would end the full-scale war within 24 hours. However, when asked by reporters during his announcement of the meeting with Zelensky how he envisioned the end of the war, he said, &quot;I don&apos;t want to tell you what that looks like.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-zelensky-at-trump-tower-in-new-york-on-sept-27/	2024-09-26T16:20:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Harris criticizes calls for concessions from Ukraine during joint press conference with Zelensky in Washington	U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a joint press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 26, ahead of their in-private meeting. Zelensky has been in the U.S. since Sept. 22, where he has held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, as well as a visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and an address to the U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky thanked Harris for her commitment to Kyiv and said, &quot;we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine.&quot; In her remarks, Harris reiterated her support for Ukraine and warned that a Russian victory would lead to further aggression and cause other nations with imperialist ambitions to be &quot;emboldened.&quot; Harris said that she had &quot;told world leaders (at the U.N.), nothing about the end of this war can be decided without Ukraine.&quot; But she added that &quot;there are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality, and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations.&quot; &quot;These proposals are the same as those of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and let us be clear, these are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.&quot; While she did not mention anyone by name, some in the Republican Party, reportedly including presidential nominee Donald Trump, have suggested that Ukraine could cede territory in exchange for peace. At a rally on Sept. 24, Trump vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war in Ukraine if elected president. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance said in an interview with Shawn Ryan earlier in September that Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time, it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added.	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-zelensky-hold-joint-press-conference-in-washington/	2024-09-26T15:48:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174706977.jpg
Zelensky meets with Biden in Washington, presents 'victory plan'	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 26. The two held talks &quot;to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; the White House said in a statement. Zelensky also presented Biden with his much-discussed victory plan. The details of the plan have not yet been made public, but the White House said that the two leaders discussed its &quot;diplomatic, economic, and military aspects.&quot; Separately, Zelensky wrote on X that he and Biden had talked about &quot;details to strengthen the plan, coordinated our positions, views, and approaches, and tasked our teams with holding consultations on the next steps.&quot; During the meeting with @POTUS, I presented the Victory Plan to him. We discussed details to strengthen the Plan, coordinated our positions, views, and approaches, and tasked our teams with holding consultations on the next steps.We deeply appreciate that Ukraine and the United&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/ow67qHZqF9 &quot;Russia will not prevail in (this) war,&quot; Biden said in the recorded remarks shared by Zelensky. &quot;Ukraine will prevail, and we will continue to stand by you every step of the way.&quot; In response, Zelensky said that &quot;we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and the U.S. have stood side-by-side from the very first moments of this terrible Russian invasion.&quot; &quot;Your determination is incredibly important for us to prevail.&quot; During Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S., Ukraine received pledges of new military aid from allies, including almost $8 billion from the U.S., as well other aid from the U.K., Germany, and Canada. The White House also said Biden would &quot;host a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany (in October), where the two leaders will review progress on these consultations and coordinate with international partners on additional assistance for Ukraine.&quot; The statement concluded with a declaration that &quot;Biden is determined to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-biden-in-washington-presents-victory-plan/	2024-09-26T14:18:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768341.jpg
White House defends Zelensky's ammunition plant visit, calls Republican investigation 'political stunt'	White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back on calls from top Republicans to investigate President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant, telling reporters on Sept. 26 that it was a &quot;political stunt&quot; and that they &quot;need to drop this.&quot; Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on Sept. 22, along with Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro and other Democratic politicians from the state, to thank workers for producing critically needed 155 mm shells for Ukraine. Following the visit, Republican Congressman James Comer, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, announced on Sept. 25 that he was opening up an investigation into the White House&apos;s &quot;misuse of government resources.&quot; Later in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson, also a Republican, wrote a letter to Zelensky demanding that Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, be fired for alleged &quot;election interference.&quot; Johnson argued that Markarova had arranged a taxpayer-funded trip to a battleground state that &quot;purposely excluded&quot; Republicans ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Jean-Pierre dismissed the investigation into the visit as a partisan effort from Republicans. She said the Ukrainian delegation had asked to visit the plant, and the Department of Defense (DoD) arranged for their transportation, &quot;which is common.&quot; The press secretary added that Zelensky had visited Utah&apos;s Republican Governor Spencer Cox in July to address the National Governors Association and that &quot;there was not a single demand for an investigation&quot; after the trip from Republicans. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the ammunition plant was &quot;business as usual for a Ukrainian request during wartime,&quot; Jean-Pierre said.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-defends-zelenskys-ammunition-plant-visit-says-calls-for-investigation-political-stunt/	2024-09-26T13:31:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYHWiqJWoAAna_c.jpeg
Deepfake' caller posing as Ukraine's ex-foreign minister talks to US Senator	U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin received a Zoom call from an unknown person claiming to be former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Sept. 26, citing a letter from the Senate security service and its undisclosed sources. The senator&apos;s office received an email from a person posing as Kuleba on Sept. 19 requesting to contact him via a Zoom call. During the video call, the person looked and spoke like Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister. The senator became suspicious when the person posing as Kuleba began to behave atypically, asking &quot;politically charged questions in relation to the upcoming election&quot; and demanding opinions on sensitive foreign policy issues such as the launch of long-range missiles into Russian territory, the media outlet wrote. The senator ended the conversation and informed the State Department, which confirmed that the person introducing himself as Kuleba was an impostor who had used &quot;deepfake&quot; technology. Deepfake video technology uses artificial intelligence to create videos with fictional people who look and sound like real ones. This technology has also been used to impersonate public figures, such as in 2022, when a video that purported to show President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing Ukraine&apos;s surrender in the war with Russia was circulated on social media. The video was later debunked. &#xA0; While the Senate security email did not specify that Cardin was involved, two Senate officials familiar with the matter confirmed it to the NYT. Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also confirmed in a statement on Sept. 25 that &quot;the malign actor&quot; had fraudulently attempted to communicate with him by posing as a &quot;known individual.&quot; Cardin did not specify that the &quot;known individual&quot; was Kuleba. It was not clear at first who had organized the operation against Cardin, the NYT said. Intelligence officials have warned that foreign actors such as Russia, Iran, and China are using artificial intelligence, including &quot;deepfakes,&quot; to bolster their election interference efforts, with Russia generating the most content, the NYT reported, citing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The presidential election will be held on Nov. 5, 2024. Democratic candidate and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will face Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/deepfake-caller-posing-as-ukraines-ex-foreign-minister-talks-to-us-senator/	2024-09-26T12:26:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168226157.jpg
UK to provide Ukraine with 4 additional AS90 self-propelled artillery howitzers	The U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Sept. 26 that it will provide Ukraine with 16 AS90 self-propelled artillery howitzers instead of 12. The announcement comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky continues his visit to the U.S., where he hopes to gain support for his recently announced &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Labor government headed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, formed following the July 4 elections, previously announced its intention to transfer 12 AS90s to Kyiv within the first 100 days of taking office. Ten of these howitzers have been delivered to Ukraine, and in the coming weeks, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will receive six more, the statement read. The British government has also announced the establishment of a new joint British Defense Ministry and Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) unit in Ukraine, headed by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey, which will &quot;integrate expertise and help drive a new whole-of-government approach to Ukraine.&quot; The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine and has pledged a total of 12.8 billion pounds (approximately $16.2 billion) in support for the country, which includes 7.8 billion pounds (around $9.9 billion) allocated for military assistance and 5 billion pounds (approximately $6.3 billion) designated for non-military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-ukraine-with-4-additional-as90-self-propelled-artillery-howitzers/	2024-09-26T11:22:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1564439232.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces new military aid package worth almost $8 billion for Ukraine	Key developments on Sept. 26: U.S. President Joe Biden announced a military aid package for Ukraine worth $7.9 billion on Sept. 26. &quot;I am grateful to U.S. President Joseph Biden, the U.S. Congress and both parties, Republican and Democrat, and the entire American people for today&apos;s announcement of significant defense aid to Ukraine totaling $7.9 billion and the imposition of sanctions against Russia,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media. Washington authorized a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $375 million the day before, on Sept. 25, amid Zelensky&apos;s ongoing visit to the U.S. Biden said that the Pentagon will allocate the remaining Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds by the end of 2024. He authorized $5.5 billion in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) &quot;to ensure this authority does not expire.&quot; Another $2.4 billion are pledged through the USAI. The new tranche will include an additional Patriot air defense battery, unmanned aerial systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as funds to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements. Washington will also provide Kyiv with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) munition &quot;to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike capabilities,&quot; Biden said. The U.S. president also announced the expansion of training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots by supporting the training of an additional 18 next year. &quot;Through these actions, my message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,&quot; Biden said. The German parliament&apos;s lower chamber, the Bundestag, has approved the German government&apos;s proposal to increase funding for military support for Ukraine by nearly 400 million euros ($447 million), according to the Sept. 25 statement. The Bundestag announced the decision to increase financial aid following a meeting under the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allied countries at the NATO summit in July 2024. The meeting was held on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The additional financial assistance will allow the procurement of more air defense systems, tanks, drones, ammunition, and spare parts, &quot;effectively strengthening the Ukrainian Armed Forces in defending their country,&quot; the statement read. Berlin also announced it will provide an additional 170 million euros ($190 million) &quot;soon&quot; to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, which comes under frequent Russian attacks. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Berlin will provide Kyiv with around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) this year, but the aid will be reportedly cut by half &#x2014; to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) &#x2014; in 2025. Berlin had been hoping that the shortfall in assistance would be made up by Ukraine receiving $50 billion in profits from frozen Russian assets. However, Hungary has caused delays in the U.S.&apos;s procedural involvement in the assets scheme. &#xA0;In addition to budgetary concerns, German &quot;anti-war&quot; parties that oppose aid to Ukraine on the right and left made gains in regional elections on Sept. 1, causing political complications for Germany&apos;s commitment to support Ukraine.According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), as of June 2024, Germany has allocated 14.7 billion euros ($16.4 billion) in support for Ukraine since 2022. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. The brigade released a video purportedly from Vuhledar saying it had been filmed there earlier in the day. &quot;We want to dispel all doubts and the pseudo-experts&apos; thoughts that the 72nd Brigade withdrew from Vuhledar,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier said. &quot;Despite heavy assaults and difficult circumstances, we are still there.&quot; The statement came after a media report suggested Ukrainian soldiers had begun to withdraw from the town, adding Vuhledar was &quot;about to fall.&quot; The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that Russian forces are aiming to encircle Vuhledar. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of town as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. &quot;Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he added. An overnight Russian drone and missile strike targeted three Ukrainian energy transmission facilities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 26. &quot;But the Russian terrorists did not achieve their goals &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s energy system is operating in a balanced mode, no power cuts are planned,&quot; he added in a post on Telegram. Shmyhal said one of the facilities targeted was in Mykolaiv Oblast in southern Ukraine, but did not specify the location of the other two. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. On the morning of Sept. 26, Russian forces also launched three Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Ukraine has 55,000 citizens in its unified register for persons missing under special circumstances, Deputy Interior Minister Leonid Tymchenko told Ukrinform in an interview published on Sept. 26. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters. The figure underscores the humanitarian impact of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which has brought illegal deportations, kidnappings, and a large number of deaths among both the military and civilians in Ukraine. &quot;The register contains information about 55,000 people. Most of them are military personnel. This figure is quite dynamic: when the whereabouts of missing persons are established, in some cases, it turns out that a citizen, for example, is in captivity,&quot; Tymchenko said. &quot;Unfortunately, we also identify the dead among those who were considered missing,&quot; he added. The latest figure shows a considerable growth since July, when the Interior Ministry revealed that 42,000 Ukrainians were considered missing. This number does not include Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories, whose numbers exceed 19,500.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-military-aid-package-worth-almost-8-billion-for-ukraine/	2024-09-26T10:39:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174502892.jpg
UK introduces sanctions against ships, companies involved in export of Russian LNG	The U.K. imposed sanctions on Sept. 25 against five vessels and two companies involved in the transportation of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it looks to exert more pressure on sources of revenue for the Kremlin, according to a statement. While LNG exports have been less heavily sanctioned than oil, recent restrictions have begun tightening the noose around this sector as well. &quot;LNG is an important source of funding for (Vladimir) Putin&apos;s illegal war in Ukraine. Russia has plans to expand its LNG revenues, aiming to grow its global LNG market share from 8% to 20%,&quot; the statement read. The vessels Pioneer, Asya Energy, Nova Energy, North Sky, and SCF La Perouse were sanctioned in this latest move. London also imposed restrictions on two entities, including Ocean Speedstar Solutions OPC, the operator of the Pioneer and Asya Energy vessels, as well as on White Fox Ship Management, the operator and manager of the North Sky vessel. Under British sanctions legislation, listed ships are prohibited from accessing U.K. ports and may face other restrictions, including arrest and denial of registration. The U.K. has now sanctioned 15 vessels and entities involved in the Russian LNG sector, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the U.K., along with its allies, the U.S. and European Union, sanctioned Arctic LNG 2. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, aims to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. It was envisaged as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a flagship project to help the country become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-introduces-sanctions-against-ships-organizations-involved-in-export-of-russian-lng/	2024-09-26T09:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1259161176.jpg

US-sanctioned ex-Ukrainian official wins defamation lawsuit against media, including Kyiv Independent	The Shevchenkivskyi District Court in Kyiv on Sept. 23 ruled in favor of Andriy Portnov, a former top official in ex-President Viktor Yanukovych&#x2019;s administration, in a defamation case against several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent. Portnov challenged a reference to him as a &#x201C;pro-Russian&#x201D; politician and a person &#x201C;infamous for his open support for Russia.&#x201D; The lawsuit concerns a story by Glib Kanievskyi, then a Ukrainian journalist and currently a defense ministry official, published in several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, in September 2023. The story was an investigative report pointing out that Ukrainian officials impose sanctions on petty pro-Russian politicians, but ignore the most high-profile ones. Portnov was listed as one of the examples: He is under sanctions in the U.S., but not in Ukraine. In response to the story, Portnov sued the author of the report and the news outlets that ran it, including Statewatch, LB.ua, and Kyiv Independent as represented by Chief Editor Olga Rudenko. Portnov, a lawyer, is known as one of the most litigious Ukrainian ex-officials. In 2021, Portnov was added to the U.S. sanctions list over allegations that he was involved in corruption in Ukraine, particularly in the judiciary. In the commentary that ran with the sanctions inclusions, the U.S. treasury wrote that Portnov &#x201C;cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine&#x2019;s judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery.&#x201D; &#x201C;Widely known as a court fixer, Portnov was credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine&#x2019;s courts and undermining reform efforts,&#x201D; reads the U.S. Treasury website. &#x201C;As of 2019, Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions. In mid-2019, Portnov colluded with a high ranking Ukrainian government official to shape the country&#x2019;s higher legal institutions to their advantage and influence Ukraine&#x2019;s Constitutional Court. Additionally, Portnov has been involved in an attempt to influence the Ukrainian Prosecutor General.&#x201D; In 2010-2014, Portnov served in the administration of then-President Yanukovych. In February 2014, Yanukovych and his administration were ousted by the protests known as the EuroMaidan Revolution. Over the course of the next few years, Ukrainian authorities looked into Portnov&#x2019;s activities as part of a number of criminal investigations, including one that concerned high treason and alleged that Portnov had a role in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. The case was closed in 2019. According to media reports, Portnov doesn&#x2019;t currently reside in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chief Editor Olga Rudenko and other defendants will appeal the ruling. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a sad irony that an ex-official sanctioned over allegations of holding undue influence over Ukrainian courts wins a case against journalists &#x2014; in a Ukrainian court,&#x201D; said Rudenko. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s alarming because it&#x2019;s symptomatic of the endemic problems in the Ukrainian judiciary. We are going to fight this ruling until the highest possible judicial instance.&#x201D; The lawyers who defended the journalists in the case said that there were obvious violations in the ruling. &#x201C;The court pronounced value judgment &#x2018;false information&#x2019; while a value judgment can&#x2019;t be disproved,&#x201D; said Oksana Maksymeniuk, head of the legal department of the Regional Press Development Institute, whose lawyers represent the media sued by Portnov. &#x201C;This ruling was certainly carried out with violations, and it will be appealed.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctioned-ex-ukrainian-official-wins-defamation-lawsuit-against-media-including-kyiv-independent/	2024-09-26T08:11:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-18_08_32-1.png

New Skynex video shows Ukraine's cutting-edge drone destroyer in action	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force has released footage showing one of its most advanced weapons in action &#x2013; the German-supplied Skynex system. Filmed in an unidentified location, the video released on Sept. 25 via social media shows the air defense system engaging and destroying targets over the skies of Ukraine. &#x201C;Practical strikes have been conducted using the Skynex air defense system against various types of aerial targets &#x2026; all are operating smoothly &#x2013; Glory to Ukraine,&#x201D; an unidentified Ukrainian soldier is seen saying in the video as other troops operate the technologically advanced system in the background. Skynex Air Defence System of the Ukrainian Air Force &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; pic.twitter.com/hhJzDXc9vs According to its German manufacturer Rheinmetall, Skynex is a &quot;networked air defense&quot; that provides &quot;a highly effective layered protection shield against a wide spectrum of air threats&quot; and serves as &quot;the necessary answer against saturation and swarm attacks in the future.&quot; In short, it&apos;s a big, powerful, and highly accurate mobile gun that is very effective at shooting down drones. Big-ticket air defense systems provided to Ukraine by Western allies like NASAMs, IRIS-T and Patriots are costly surface-to-air missiles. Hence, they are set aside to intercept Russian missiles. Air defense systems firing multiple rounds of high-caliber bullets using sophisticated computer targeting and mechanical systems like the Skynex, in contrast, are used to protect Ukraine&#x2019;s skies by intercepting drones. The Iranian-made Shahed drones deployed by Russia&#x2019;s invading forces daily for strikes across Ukraine are cheap. Export versions cost around $193,000, and those made by Russia domestically cost only about $10,000-$50,000. One NASAM missile costs from $600,000 to $1 million. A Patriot missile is nearly $4 million. A relatively cheap IRIS-T missile is still around $450,000. Russia launches Shahed-type drones against Ukraine on an almost nightly basis. In the early hours of Sept. 26, it was reported that 78 were used in overnight attacks across the country, so using air defense missiles to shoot them down is not a financially viable option in the long term. &quot;One of the key features of the war is the use of relatively low-cost delivery systems such as drones,&quot; Martin J. Dougherty, weapons expert and author of &quot;Aircraft, Tanks and Artillery of the Ukraine War,&quot; told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year. &quot;Defense against such weapons requires a low cost per engagement and the ability to eliminate multiple threats in a short time. &quot;The difficulty of detecting, tracking, and hitting such small targets is also considerable,&quot; Dougherty added. Ukraine has relied on systems like the German-made Gepard and the more basic and not always effective tactic of shooting them down with large 50-caliber machine guns mounted on trucks. Close one. Ukrainian mobile air defense units in Kharkiv oblast trying to repel a Shahed drone attack. The drone hits the ground just tens of meters away. pic.twitter.com/8xuHNPwO7t Skynex is a middle ground between the two &#x2013; a highly accurate system that can down drones more efficiently. Skynex is a modular system, meaning it can be configured in a variety of ways depending on the threat. Details of those systems sent to Ukraine have not been made public, but a version featured in a Rheinmetall promotional video from 2022 would seem likely to be a candidate. In it, an Oerlikon Revolver Gun Mk3 &#x2013; used in the Skynex system and capable of firing at a rate of 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of 4,000 meters &#x2013; mounted on a truck takes out a swarm of small FPV (first-person-view) drones in a single burst of fire. According to Rheinmetall&apos;s rather vague description, Skynex uses a variety of &quot;sensors and effectors,&quot; as well as &quot;one or several medium-range radars&quot; to detect and identify the drones, all coordinated through the Oerlikon Skymaster Battle Management System. But it&apos;s the ammunition that is key. Skynex fires 35mm Oerlikon Ahead rounds. Instead of directly striking the target, they explode just before they reach it, releasing a cluster of tungsten sub-projectiles which increases the chances of successfully destroying the drone. (Please add the credit)Crucially, it&apos;s also relatively cheap. Taking out a target costs just over $4,000, significantly less than even the lowest price estimate of a Shahed. According to the manufacturer, it can also, in theory, take down cruise missiles, though it&apos;s not currently known if it has done so. &quot;Skynex was developed to counter small, low-cost threats such as mortar rounds. This capability has transferred well to the emerging drone threat and may be essential to a layered air defense system,&quot; Dougherty said. As far as has been reported, Ukraine only possesses two Skynex systems, far too few to have a decisive impact on the war. While their locations are not public, given their effectiveness, it can be safely assumed they&apos;re protecting at least two very important targets &#x2014; possibly even their longer-range and more powerful big brothers. &quot;High-value missile systems, capable of engaging enemy aircraft at long range, may be vulnerable to attack by small, hard-to-track loitering munitions,&quot; Dougherty said. &quot;It may be that short-range air defense systems such as Skynex will be necessary to keep the big hitters in the game.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/new-skynex-video-shows-ukraines-cutting-edge-drone-destroyer-in-action/	2024-09-26T07:14:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_Skynex.jpg
Biden to convene Ramstein leader-level meeting in October	U.S. President Joe Biden will convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany in October &quot;to coordinate the efforts of the more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; he announced on Sept. 26. The announcement comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky continues his visit to the U.S., where he hopes to get support for his recently-announced &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. During the meeting, which Zelensky attended in person, Ukraine received pledges of new military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. Kyiv has been promised at least one air defense system, along with missiles, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and other munitions. The much-coveted long-range weapons like additional ATACMS or Storm Shadow were not on the list, nor were changes to restrictions on their use. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia but wants the backing of the U.S. and other countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-to-convene-ramstein-leader-level-meeting-in-october/	2024-09-26T07:05:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161024572-1.jpg
What we know about the ‘victory plan’ Zelensky is presenting to Biden today	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to present the victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26, a potentially pivotal moment in the long-running saga of Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine. Zelensky, who is visiting the U.S. this week, has said that the plan is designed to push Russian President Vladimir Putin into a fair peace agreement by boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s firepower and giving it an upper hand two and a half years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky has not publicly specified how it will achieve this. Here&apos;s what we know so far&#x2026; The announcement that Kyiv was preparing a victory plan came as Ukraine gained momentum following its surprise incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. The ongoing operation, the first significant invasion of Russian territory since World War II, was a significant blow to the Kremlin and Putin. It exposed Russia&#x2019;s inability to defend its own territory and challenged Putin&#x2019;s so-called &quot;red lines&quot; aimed at deterring Ukraine&#x2019;s Western allies from stepping up weaponry supplies. It also showed Ukraine&apos;s backers that Kyiv could still seize the initiative on the battlefield. As well as riding the momentum of the Kursk operation, events in the U.S. could also be a big factor in Kyiv&apos;s push to present the plan &#x2014; the November U.S. presidential election that might bring former President Donald Trump back to the White House and jeopardize the U.S. support for Ukraine. The fine details of the plan are yet to be made public. It is expected to address military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies. A source close to Zelensky told the Kyiv Independent last week that it aims &quot;to create such conditions and such an atmosphere that Russia will no longer be able to ignore the peace formula and the peace summit.&quot; But some elements have been revealed. The head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak earlier this week said that an invitation to join NATO is part of the plan. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 22, Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Yermak also said that the five-point victory plan includes both diplomatic and military components. US President Joe Biden shakes hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at an event with world leaders launching a Joint Declaration of Support for Ukrainian Recovery and Reconstruction on the sidelines of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, US on Sep. 25, 2024. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I also urged our partners to ignore Russia&apos;s threats of escalation,&quot; he said. One element certain to be in the plan is the U.S. and other allies&apos; approval for Ukraine to use long-range weapons including Western-provided missiles to target military sites deep inside Russia. Kyiv has long been pushing for restrictions to be lifted as it would enable Ukraine to destroy the airfields from which Russian aircraft are taking off to attack Ukrainian civilian infrastructure as well as degrade Russian air defenses. And we also know one thing that won&apos;t be in the plan &#x2013; a partial ceasefire. After a German media report suggested otherwise, Zelensky personally refuted the claim. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18. The first reports aren&apos;t too positive. The White House is concerned that Zelensky&apos;s plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 25, citing U.S. and European officials. Some officials familiar with the plan&apos;s outlines said it focuses too heavily on requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes. &quot;I&apos;m unimpressed, there&apos;s not much new there,&quot; one senior official told the WSJ. White House officials are worried that Zelensky&apos;s plan does not offer clear, actionable steps that Biden can support in his four remaining months in office, the WSJ reported. U.S. and European officials told the WSJ that parts of the plan remain underdeveloped, and that requests related to weapons are the most specific and detailed. &quot;That&apos;s a horrible thought,&quot; Zelensky said when asked this question by The New Yorker in an interview, published on Sept. 22. &quot;It would mean that Biden doesn&apos;t want to end the war in any way that denies Russia a victory,&quot; he said. &quot;And we would end up with a very long war&#x2014;an impossible, exhausting situation that would kill a tremendous number of people. Having said that, I can&apos;t blame Biden for anything,&quot; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-we-know-about-the-victory-plan-zelensky-is-presenting-to-biden-today/	2024-09-26T06:39:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173579421.jpg
3 energy infrastructure facilities struck in overnight Russian strikes, Ukrainian PM says	An overnight Russian drone and missile strike targeted three Ukrainian energy transmission facilities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 26. &quot;But the Russian terrorists did not achieve their goals &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s energy system is operating in a balanced mode, no power cuts are planned,&quot; he added in a post on Telegram. Shmyhal said one of the facilities targeted was in Mykolaiv Oblast in southern Ukraine, but did not specify the location of the other two. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. On the morning of Sept. 26, Russian forces also launched three Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-energy-infrastructure-facilities-struck-in-overnight-russian-strikes-ukrainian-pm-says/	2024-09-26T06:26:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-26-16_12_08.jpeg
Ukraine's 72nd Brigade releases video from Vuhledar, denies claims about withdrawal	Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. The brigade released a video purportedly from Vuhledar saying it had been filmed there earlier in the day. &quot;We want to dispel all doubts and the pseudo-experts&apos; thoughts that the 72nd Brigade withdrew from Vuhledar,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier said. &quot;Despite heavy assaults and difficult circumstances, we are still there.&quot; The statement came after a media report suggested Ukrainian soldiers had begun to withdraw from the town, adding Vuhledar was &quot;about to fall.&quot; The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. 0:00/1&#xD7;Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. (Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade)The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that Russian forces are aiming to encircle Vuhledar. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of town as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. &quot;Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-72nd-brigade-releases-video-from-vuhledar-denies-claims-about-withdrawal/	2024-09-26T04:40:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325594-2.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 148	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 148 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from September 15-21, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. UDI looking for a new CEO. On Sept. 19, Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI) said that its supervisory board had launched a competitive selection for the CEO position. Candidates can apply from Sept. 20 to Oct. 4. The search and screening of applicants is done by the Ukrainian office of Odgers Berndtson, an international executive search firm, UDI added. As we wrote earlier, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin resigned on Sept. 4 to become the new strategic industries minister the next day, replacing Oleksandr Kamyshin. UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board then appointed Oleh Huliak as an acting CEO and said that it would announce a competitive selection for the new CEO as soon as possible. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia gets a new supervisory board member. On Sept. 13, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Oleksandr Kamyshin as a state representative on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board, starting on Sept. 26. Kamyshin will replace Serhiy Moskalenko, Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source added. (See our Issue 60 for more information on the composition of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board.) As we reported in Issue 39 three years ago, then acting CEO of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ivan Yuryk, filed his resignation in August 2021. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Kamyshin as acting CEO. In Issue 49, we reported that in October 2021, Kamyshin was re-appointed as CEO until Dec. 31, 2021. On March 24, 2022, Kamyshin reported that based on the supervisory board&#x2019;s proposal, the Cabinet appointed the executive board of Ukrzaliznytsia on a permanent basis. Kamyshin was approved for four years, and the other executives, for three years. As we wrote one and half years ago, the Cabinet dismissed Kamyshin on March 21, 2023, and appointed Yevhen Lyashchenko as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years. On the same day, the Verkhovna Rada appointed Kamyshin as the new strategic industries minister. See Issue 80 for more detail. As we reported two weeks ago, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin left the company to become the new strategic industries minister. He replaced Kamyshin, who later moved to the position of president&#x2019;s advisor for strategic issues. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrenergo to get a new supervisory board. On Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry (in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting) announced a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they filed their resignation notices. &#x201C;We strongly believe that the decision on the early dismissal of the CEO of Ukrenergo is politically motivated and, based on the results of the presented report, there are no valid grounds for it,&#x201D; they said in a statement. On Sept. 6, Bridget Brink, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that Ukraine should complete Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board after independent members resigned in protest against Kudrytskyi&#x2019;s dismissal. See Issue 146 for more detail. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine would have access to about $1.1 billion. According to IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. The terms of office of the current members of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s board expire in late 2024 &#x2014; early 2025, the ministry added. Along with the competitive selection of independent members, the ministry would also identify and select candidate state representatives. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. As we reported in June 2023, the Cabinet still had to select and approve one independent member for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. Hence, independent members did not constitute a majority of the board, which did not meet the requirements of the law or Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter. See our Issue 95 for more detail. The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. The first and foremost task of the new supervisory board would be to conduct a transparent competitive selection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO, the ministry also said. Naftogaz Group pays Hr 60 billion ($1.5billion) in taxes for January-August 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on 1Sept. 16. This includes Hr 56.5 billion ($1.37 billion) paid to the state budget and Hr 4.3 billion ($104 million) paid to local government budgets. In August alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 7.2 billion ($174 million) in state taxes and about Hr 600 million ($14.5 million) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 6.1 billion ($147.9 million) in taxes to state and local budgets for January 2024 (see Issue 119), Hr 5.3 billion ($128 million) for February (see Issue 123), Hr 8.3 billion ($201 million) for March (see Issue 128), Hr 8 billion ($193 million) for April (see Issue 132), Hr 9.3 billion ($225 million) for May (see Issue 137), Hr 9.2 billion ($223 million) for June (see Issue 140), and Hr 6 billion ($145 million) for July (see Issue 143). As we wrote in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($164 million) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($560 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022. See our Issue 131 for detail. Hotel Ukraina sold. On Sept. 18, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million), a more than twofold increase from the starting price of Hr 1.05 billion ($25 million). According to Prozorro.Sale, the winner is Ola Fine LLC, owned by businessman Maksym Krippa. Notably, Ola Fine&#x2019;s bid was almost double of the second bid, Hr 1.5 billion (around $36 million), and more than double of the third bid, Hr 1.2 billion (ca. $29 million). The sale of the Ukraine Hotel was the country&#x2019;s first online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, the SPFU said. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projects the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around $96 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated Hr 2 billion ($48 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatization. In other words, the winning bid on Hotel Ukraina alone is larger than all the small-scale privatization revenues since the beginning of this year. If Ola Fine pays up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, will be completed for the first time in many years. According to the SPFU, the auction winner has 30 working days to pay the lot price. Only after the funds are transferred to the state budget can the sale and purchase agreement be signed. Maksym Krippa, a businessman that shies publicity, became famous in 2022 when Forbes Ukraine wrote that he had acquired the main Ukrainian esports brand, the NAVI team. Later, the businessman&#x2019;s representatives confirmed that the deal was concluded back in 2018. Krippa also owns Maincast esports broadcasting studio. In 2023, he acquired GSC Game World, a company that developed the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. cyber game. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP), also in 2023, a new media group was formed in Ukraine: the online outlet Glavkom was taken over by Tatiana Snopko. Six months earlier, Snopko had acquired the Ekonomika+ media holding, which includes Delo.ua, Top-100, Wo.mo, and Marketing Media Review. According to EP&#x2019;s sources in the media market, Krippa was behind the acquisition of the news sites, while Snopko was just a nominal owner. According to liga.net, Krippa, who acquired the Brovary Wholesale Market back in 2009, has recently started buying up significant real estate objects in Kyiv. In 2020, he purchased the Dnipro Hotel in Kyiv, which is located near the Ukraine Hotel, and at the end of 2023, the Parus Business Center, previously owned by businessman and former lawmaker Vadym Stolar. In an interview for Forbes Ukraine last week, Krippa claimed that he received funds for these assets from diversified sources: income from successfully implemented business projects, real estate, dividends, and investment assets. Earlier, Forbes Ukraine linked him to the Vulcan Online Casino, GGBet bookmakers, and Evoplay IT company, but Krippa denied this. In his interview for Forbes Ukraine last week, Krippa said that Ukraine Hotel is not just a hotel, but a historic building in central Kyiv with significant capitalization potential. He plans to effectively develop the hotel and renovate it after the full-scale war, but he refused to disclose the plan. As we wrote in Issue 116, the SPFU planned to put Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Hotel Ukraina up for privatization. According to SPFU then-head Vitaliy Koval, the hotel is under-booked because of martial law and has racked up more than Hr 45 million in debt (around $1.1 million at the time). The Cabinet of Ministers designated Hotel Ukraina as a large-scale asset for privatization on April 23 (see our Issue 129). On July 12, the Cabinet approved the terms of sale of the hotel. The starting price was set at Hr 1.05 billion ($25 million). See Issue 140 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 141, the SPFU then scheduled the auction for the Hotel Ukraina for Sept. 18. The tenth and eleventh attempts to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port fail. According to Prozorro.Sale, an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport, scheduled by the SPFU for Sept. 16, failed due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 89 million ($2.1 million). This was the tenth attempt to sell the port. The SPFU then extended the deadline for bidders to Sept. 24 with the same starting price, but the eleventh auction also failed for the same reason. Prior to that auction, the SPFU told delo.ua that if no bidders come forward, the starting price would have to be reduced further. Earlier, liga.net wrote that SME Nika-Tera LLC (part of Dmytro Firtash&#x2019;s Group DF), Potoky Oil Extraction Plant (part of Vadym Yermolayev&#x2019;s Alef Corporation), and grain trading and shipbuilding Nibulon (owned by Andriy Vadatursky) were interested in privatizing the port. The payback period of the port is too long to invest in it in the current realities, Oleg Arestarkhov, Head of Corporate Communications at Group DF, told liga.net. As we wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. This suggests that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.2 million) in total. Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also faces a significant logistical constraint: the drawbridge to the port was destroyed by Russian shelling. Without its restoration, the port would not be able to operate properly, Arestarkhov added. &#x201C;Near Mykolaiv, we have the Nika-Tera port, which was destroyed by Russian attacks. Our post-war priorities are to restore our port. We will restore our port, and only then will we look at other assets,&#x201D; he summarized. Later, Nibulon told delo.ua that it was no longer considering the acquisition of the asset, without specifying the reasons for the refusal. Alef Corporation did not comment on its plans to privatize the port, the media added. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around $5 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest did not pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed. (See Issue 93.)&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, as we reported in Issue 147, the ninth attempt to sell the port also failed.

US pledges nearly $8 billion in military aid for Ukraine, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The U.S. announced a military aid package for Ukraine worth $7.9 billion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 26. &quot;I am grateful to U.S. President Joseph Biden, the U.S. Congress and both parties, Republican and Democrat, and the entire American people for today&apos;s announcement of significant defense aid to Ukraine totaling $7.9 billion and the imposition of sanctions against Russia,&quot; he said in a post on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pledges-nearly-8-billion-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-09-26T03:13:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 8, injure 44 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed eight people and injured at least 44 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 26. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. More than 15 drones were spotted near Kyiv, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, local authorities said. The rest of the drones were destroyed over 14 of Ukraine&apos;s oblasts, the Air Force reported. Russian forces also attacked Odesa Oblast with four missiles overnight, killing a 62-year-old woman, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Two more missiles were fired at Sumy Oblast. The drone attack also damaged a critical infrastructure facility in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine&apos;s west, causing a partial power outage, according to local authorities. Another Russian drone flew near the industrial site of the Rivne nuclear power plant at &quot;a critically low altitude,&quot; state nuclear energy agency Energoatom said. A Russian overnight air strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least 10 people, including a 14-year-old boy, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The attack destroyed and damaged 12 houses. Two people were killed and 19 injured in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast as a result of a Russian Sept. 25 attack, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were killed in the settlements of Hirnyk and Dronivka. A civilian was killed in a Russian guided aerial bomb attack on the Yunakivka community in Sumy Oblast, local authorities reported. A Russian attack on the village of Ivashky in Kharkiv Oblast on the morning of Sept. 26 injured a person, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Two people were killed and 14 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-at-least-8-injure-44-over-past-day/	2024-09-26T02:52:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-26_07-37-32.jpg
3 Red Cross representatives injured in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	A Russian attack on the city of Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 25 injured three representatives of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society while on a humanitarian mission, the organization said. Russia targeted the city center with two guided aerial bombs, damaging two high-rise buildings, shops, and cars. At least two people were killed and 19 injured, including children, local authorities reported. One Red Cross volunteer was injured and hospitalized. The head of the Kramatorsk city organization of the Ukrainian Red Cross and the driver who were in the car also suffered injuries, the organization said. &quot;The Ukrainian Red Cross continues its mission to provide assistance to the civilian population despite the danger posed by the ongoing war in the country,&quot; the statement read. In mid-September, Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others. Kramatorsk comes under regular Russian attacks. The strike on the Safir (Sapphire) Hotel in on Aug. 24 killed British national Ryan Evans, a security adviser for Reuters, and seriously injured Reuters camera operator Ivan Lubysh-Kirdey.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-red-cross-employees-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kramatorsk/	2024-09-26T02:05:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/460963925_942627737909097_8200267715590976812_n.jpg
Explosions heard in Kyiv as Russia reportedly launches Kinzhal missiles	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Explosions were heard in Kyiv on the morning of Sept. 26 almost immediately after an air raid alert went off in the city, Kyiv Independent correspondents reported. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said that Russia had used a Mig-31K aircraft, a carrier of Kinzhal ballistic missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine. At least two missiles were launched, according to the statement. No damage or casualties have been reported at this time. Explosions were also reported in the town of Starokostinatyniv in western Khmelnytskyi Oblast, which is the home of a Ukrainian air base. Overnight, more than 15 drones were spotted near Kyiv, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-kyiv-amid/	2024-09-26T00:33:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163411657.jpg
Over 30 nations, EU adopt declaration in support of Ukraine's recovery	More than 30 countries and the European Union adopted the Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine during a meeting in New York on Sept. 25, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office said. Backed during the Group of Seven (G7) + Ukraine meeting, the document contains several points including helping to rebuild Ukraine on its path to EU accession, and providing about $50 billion by the end of 2024 in profits from frozen Russian assets. &quot;I&apos;m determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival. Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military,&quot; U.S. President Joe Biden said. The U.S. authorized a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $375 million on Sept. 25. Washington is also reportedly planning a military aid package worth over $8 billion, which is expected to be announced when President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the White House on Sept. 26. The countries said that by collectively supporting Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction they will ensure that Russia is unable to achieve its goals, as well as contribute to the post-war stability of Ukraine&apos;s economy, according to the Presidential Office. Zelensky said that the effort will be coordinated through the Ukrainian Donor Platform. &quot;It is absolutely justified that those who help us withstand now will be the first to benefit together with Ukraine from the large-scale reconstruction,&quot; he added. The material costs of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine continue to grow as Moscow&apos;s forces regularly strike the country&apos;s cities and infrastructure with missiles and drones. The estimated cost of Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery has risen to $486 billion over a 10-year period, the World Bank said in February. Kyiv has been searching for new sources of income, both at home and abroad, to cover these needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-30-nations-eu-adopt-declaration-in-support-of-ukraines-recovery/	2024-09-25T23:49:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/b5add7458d49a8184a52e165f82ffd46_1727302903_extra_large.jpeg
Opinion: As Russia circumvents sanctions, Europe faces a strategic crossroads	Returning from their summer recess, European Union leaders have a packed agenda. At the top of the list are strengthening the bloc&#x2019;s readiness for conflict and bolstering its economic competitiveness. For decades, the EU relied on economic influence as a substitute for hard power. But in an era of renewed geopolitical tensions, soft power is not sufficient. The evidence of this comes in many forms. If Europe&#x2019;s shrinking industrial base and scramble to adjust to the reality of de-globalization are not convincing enough, Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine surely must be. That conflict has not only upended the long-held belief that full-scale wars in Europe belonged to the past; it has also demonstrated the limits of economic ties and levers to shape countries&#x2019; behavior. Despite facing one of the most expansive sanctions regimes in history, Russia&#x2019;s economy grew by 5.4% in the first quarter of this year, and 4% in the second &#x2013; well above the global average. A key reason for this resilience is that Russia has found ways to circumvent sanctions and acquire restricted goods, including defense and high-tech products. More than half of the battlefield equipment that Russia obtained between February and August of 2022 contained components made in Europe or the United States. And the majority of the semiconductors being exported from China and Hong Kong to Russia &#x2013; a trade that has surged tenfold since the war started &#x2013; originated with U.S. manufacturers. The Western firms producing those goods, however, are not reaping the full profits of this trade, which is happening largely through complex networks involving third countries. It is no coincidence that Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and several Central Asian countries have drastically increased their trade with both Russia and Europe since the 2022 invasion. Kazakhstan has a relatively small tech industry, yet its tech exports to Russia surged from $40 million in 2021 to $298 million in 2023. Russia&#x2019;s success at circumventing sanctions &#x2013; often at high cost to Western businesses &#x2013; has forced European policymakers to scramble to adapt. While 14 rounds of sanctions have been introduced in two and a half years, Europe&#x2019;s leaders have so far failed to devise effective solutions. The new trade with Russia is simply too lucrative for intermediary countries to pass up. While the EU could step up its pressure on these countries, using either carrots (like aid packages) or sticks (secondary sanctions), coercion would create its own challenges, and it could undermine Europe&#x2019;s economic and security interests.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Intermediaries are also handling goods headed in the opposite direction: as the EU has sought to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, it has often ended up importing refined Russian fuel at inflated prices via third countries, such as India. Even in terms of direct energy imports, many EU countries continue to rely on Russia. Austria now gets a staggering 98% of its natural gas from Russia&#x2019;s state energy company, Gazprom, with the share having risen since the start of the Ukraine war. Moreover, the EU&#x2019;s imports of liquefied natural gas from Russia surged by 37.7% between 2021 and 2023. Given that LNG is particularly expensive, this has further exacerbated energy costs &#x2013; and internal discord. The EU&#x2019;s failure to update its fragmented and reactive energy framework has left it unable to balance geopolitical considerations with economic realities. This has not only eroded the bloc&#x2019;s soft power &#x2013; including its international credibility and its economic competitiveness &#x2013; but also has undermined its ability to invest in strengthening its hard power. This situation calls for a fundamental rethink of Europe&#x2019;s priorities and policies, argues Mario Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank and prime minister of Italy, in a just-released report. For example, he suggests that the EU should break its habit of blocking mergers over competition concerns &#x2013; a practice that has often kept European firms too small to compete globally &#x2013; and instead introduce a new regime for monitoring potentially problematic mergers after they happen. More broadly, Draghi argues that the EU must urgently strengthen its industrial base, simplify its regulatory framework, and increase investment in defense and innovation. Without these reforms &#x2013; designed carefully and implemented quickly &#x2013; the EU risks falling even further behind at a time when it can ill afford to. The stakes will grow only higher if Donald Trump returns for a second term in the White House, which would surely lead to the U.S. becoming a far less reliable partner, leaving Europe&#x2019;s security and economy even more vulnerable than they already are.

Opinion: Achieving peace through strength in Ukraine	Russian President Vladimir Putin denies Ukraine&#x2019;s right to sovereignty, having invaded it twice since 2014. Thankfully, his efforts to subjugate the country have been thwarted by the courage of the Ukrainian people. After two and a half years of fiercely defending their homeland, it has become abundantly clear that Ukrainians will never submit to Russian tyranny. But despite their resilience, Putin&#x2019;s brutal war of aggression continues. If Ukraine&#x2019;s allies fail to show the necessary resolve, the conflict could drag on for years, undermining European stability. Moreover, an increasingly militaristic Russia threatens not only Ukraine but the entire world, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Russia&#x2019;s war has already sent shockwaves around the world, driving up energy and food prices and jeopardizing nuclear safety. By violating fundamental principles of international law, Russia has destabilized the global order. To promote peace, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies must make Putin understand that he cannot dictate the terms of how the war will end. They can do this by building global support for a peace agreement rooted in the fundamental principles of international law, strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield, providing long-term security guarantees, and outlining a clear path to NATO accession. While Putin aims to prolong the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is actively pursuing a sustainable peace. This summer, he gathered representatives from more than 90 countries in Switzerland to rally support for his ten-point peace formula, which calls for strengthening nuclear safety and addressing the conflict&#x2019;s environmental repercussions, in addition to full Russian withdrawal. Global pressure will be critical to reaching an agreement, but enduring peace also requires strong security guarantees. Given that Russia has repeatedly shown its disregard for international law and basic human rights by violating treaties and committing widespread war crimes, peace cannot rest on Putin&#x2019;s promises alone. The outcome of the war will depend on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself. President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) is welcomed by Switzerland&apos;s Ambassador to Ukraine Felix Baumann (L) and Deputy Head of Swiss Protocol Manuel Irman (R) as he arrives at the Zurich airport on June 14, 2024, ahead of the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland. (Michael Buholzer/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The immediate priority is to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield. As Russian missiles and drones continue to kill civilians across the country, with most attacks launched from Russian territory, Ukraine has every right to deploy long-range weapons to hit these targets and enter Russia to prevent further assaults. Limiting its ability to do so is essentially asking it to fight with one arm tied behind its back. Ukrainian forces have consistently shown they can use Western-supplied weapons effectively and responsibly. It is time for allies to lift any remaining restrictions on the types of weapons delivered and how they can be used. But along with immediate support, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies must commit to providing it with military equipment and financial resources for as long as needed. Ukraine has already received long-term security guarantees from more than 30 countries as part of the Kyiv Security Compact, which we co-authored. Now is the time to prove that these guarantees have teeth. In the coming months, our efforts will focus on ensuring that the guarantees deliver on their promise. This involves monitoring their implementation, assessing evolving threats, and highlighting the ways Ukraine&#x2019;s security needs align with Europe&#x2019;s broader defense strategy. Preventing Putin from winning the peace will require more than security guarantees. Ukraine&#x2019;s allies should expand their support by taking steps like training Ukrainian forces within the country and deploying civilian contractors or specialized military teams to repair damaged equipment on-site. Neighboring allies could establish an extended air-defense shield over Western Ukraine to intercept incoming Russian missiles and drones, thereby saving civilian lives and enabling Ukraine to redeploy its air-defense systems to the front lines. Each of these steps will undoubtedly strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s position in any future negotiations. But ultimately, the only way to ensure long-term peace and security in Europe is to bring Ukraine into NATO. Leaving Ukraine in the grey zone between Russia and the Alliance would only invite more instability, aggression, and violence. NATO leaders must act decisively and offer Ukraine a path to membership. While this does not mean that Ukraine will join overnight, such a commitment would send a strong message to Putin that his war will not prevent its eventual accession. Faced with Putin&#x2019;s heavily militarized and increasingly revanchist Russia, Ukraine and its allies must embrace the ancient Roman maxim si vis pacem, para bellum (&#x201C;If you want peace, prepare for war&#x201D;). Over the past two and a half years, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated an unwavering determination to defend their freedom. But to achieve lasting peace, the international community must muster the courage and strength to support and maintain it.

Multiple waves of explosions in Kyiv, 1 injured	Multiple waves of explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight on Sept. 26. Air defense systems were active for a long time, and drone debris was found in the Pecherskyi district, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Emergency services were called to the district due to a fire on the first floor of a residential building caused by falling debris. The Kyiv City Military Administration (KMVA) confirmed that a child was injured during the nighttime attack using Shahed drones and was hospitalized with multiple wounds. Authorities are continuing to assess the damage and monitor the situation as further updates come in.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-waves-of-explosions-in-kyiv-1-injured/	2024-09-25T21:58:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/fire.jpg
US raises concerns over alleged Russian drone production in China	According to a White House spokesperson, the U.S. expressed deep concern over a Reuters report claiming that Russia has established a secret drone production project in China. The Reuters report suggests that a Chinese company is providing lethal assistance to a U.S.-- sanctioned Russian firm, IEMZ Kupol, which is developing drones for use in Ukraine. A White House National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson stated there is no indication that the Chinese government was aware of these transactions, but emphasized that China is responsible for ensuring its companies are not involved in providing lethal aid to Russia. The NSC spokesperson added that China&#x2019;s efforts to prevent such activities &quot;are clearly not meeting the mark&quot; and that the U.S. may take action against Chinese companies involved. A NATO spokesperson also commented on the issue via email, stating: &quot;These reports are deeply concerning and Allies are consulting on this matter.&quot; The report also notes that these drones have been delivered to Russia, although China denies knowledge of the project and maintains strict export controls on drones. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-raises-concerns-over-alleged-russian-drone-production-in-china/	2024-09-25T21:32:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg
Zelensky thanks Starmer for UK's commitment to Ukraine	During a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine&apos;s security situation, the implementation of a bilateral security agreement, and preparations for the second peace summit.

Starmer has recently expressed his intention to continue discussions at the UN General Assembly regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s use of long-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-thanks-starmer-for-uks-commitment-to-ukraine/	2024-09-25T18:43:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162001991.jpg
Some Western leaders 'unimpressed' with Ukraine's victory plan, WSJ reports	The White House is concerned that President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan for Ukraine lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 25, citing U.S. and European officials. Zelensky is set to present the details of his much-anticipated plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during a White House visit on Sept. 26. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace. Some officials familiar with the plan&apos;s outlines said it focuses too heavily on requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes. &quot;I&apos;m unimpressed, there&apos;s not much new there,&quot; one senior official told the WSJ. A key part of the plan hinges on the U.S. and Western countries allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep within Russia, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said. If the U.S. does not grant those permissions, Ukraine&apos;s proposals will be &quot;less relevant,&quot; he told the WSJ. White House officials are worried that Zelensky&apos;s plan does not offer clear, actionable steps that Biden can support in his four remaining months in office, the WSJ reported. U.S. and European officials told the WSJ that parts of the plan remain underdeveloped, and that requests related to weapons are the must specific and detailed. The Biden administration has been reluctant to grant wider permission for Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike military targets on Russian territory, citing the possibility of escalation with Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin played into those fears ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House, proposing changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. Putin said Russia could interpret any &quot;aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state&quot; as a &quot;joint attack&quot; against Russia. Putin&apos;s nuclear warnings come as multiple Western outlets, including Politico and the Guardian, have reported that the U.S. and U.K. are considering shifting their positions on long-range strikes and preparing plans to ease current restrictions. Biden said on Sept. 25 that he plans to announce a number of support measures for Ukraine during Zelensky&apos;s visit. &quot;Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military,&quot; he said. The announcement will reportedly include over $8 billion in military aid to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/some-us-leaders-unimpressed-with-ukraines-victory-plan-wsj-reports/	2024-09-25T16:51:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174503209.jpg
White House announces $375 million in military assistance to Ukraine	The U.S. has authorized a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $375 million, the White House announced on Sept. 25. The aid includes air-to-ground weapons, munitions for rocket systems, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons. The assistance comes via the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which U.S. President Joe Biden authorized on Sept. 25. Prior to the announcement, Biden pledged ongoing support to Kyiv in a Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-announces-375-million-in-military-assistance-to-ukraine/	2024-09-25T15:11:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
US to announce 'series of actions' supporting Ukraine, Biden says	The United States on Sept. 26 will announce &quot;a series of actions to accelerate support&quot; for Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and future recovery, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sept. 25. Biden convened with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 25 to launch a Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine&apos;s Recovery and Reconstruction. &quot;I&apos;m determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military.&quot; The announcement will likely to include a package worth $8 billion in military assistance, Reuters reported earlier on Sept. 25. Zelensky will visit the White House on Sept. 26 to outline his five-point victory plan for Ukraine to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden said that U.S. support will cover Ukraine&apos;s needs on the battlefield as well as its economic recovery. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s economy is resilient, and together, we can help Ukraine go from economic resilience to economic revival,&quot; he said. Biden did not detail what type of military support the U.S. will announce during Zelensky&apos;s visit. Kyiv has been aggressively lobbying Washington to lift restrictions on the use of long-range U.S. weapons to strike military targets within Russia, a step the Biden administration has not yet been willing to take for fear of escalation with Moscow. Ahead of Zelensky&apos;s White House visit, Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. The proposed amendments include treating &quot;aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state&quot; as a &quot;joint attack&quot; against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-series-of-actions-supporting-ukraine-biden-says/	2024-09-25T14:49:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173583735.jpg
Trump slams Zelensky for refusing to 'make a deal' with Moscow	Former U.S. President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky at a campaign rally on Sept. 25, accusing Zelensky of refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; against Trump. The comments come as Zelensky visits the U.S. to rally support for Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit among world leaders and present his five-point victory plan to American leadership. Zelensky has reportedly not scheduled any meetings with Trump. &quot;The president of Ukraine is in our country and he&apos;s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,&quot; Trump said during a campaign speech in the U.S. state of North Carolina. &quot;We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelensky.&quot; At a rally the previous day, Trump vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war in Ukraine if elected president. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican leaders on Sept. 25 also accused Zelensky of interfering in the election by visiting an ammunition factory in U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s hometown of Scranton, Pennyslvania, a hotly contested battleground state. House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded that Zelensky fire Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Makarovka, for her role in arranging the tour. The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee also announced he was opening an investigation into the Biden-Harris administration&apos;s alleged misuse of government funds. Zelensky criticized Trump&apos;s plans for an end to the war in an interview with the New Yorker earlier this week. He called Trump&apos;s running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance, &quot;too radical&quot; and said the war should not end at Ukraine&apos;s expense.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-slams-zelensky-for-refusing-to-make-a-deal-with-moscow/	2024-09-25T13:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173584604.jpg
US to announce $8 billion military aid package when Zelensky visits White House, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing a military aid package for Ukraine worth over $8 billion, Reuters reported on Sept. 25, citing two U.S. officials. The U.S. plans to announce the new aid package when President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the White House on Sept. 26, officials said. U.S. President Joe Biden has been working with Congress to extend $5.8 billion in military funding for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September. A second announcement on Sept. 26 will allocate $2.4 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The second package will include munitions, anti-drone weapons, and material to support ammunition production in Ukraine, one of the officials told Reuters. The U.S. is also expected to announce a $375 million aid package for Ukraine later on Sept. 25, ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit, the officials said. The officials confirmed reports that this package will include a medium-range glide bomb known as the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). The missile has a range of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) and can be dropped from F-16 fighter jets. Zelensky is expected to visit the White House on Sept. 26 to present his victory plan for Ukraine to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22 and has spent the past week meeting with world leaders on the sidelines of the 79th U.N. General Assembly.

Putin suggests changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine on Sept. 25 during a Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence, Russia&apos;s state-owned outlet Ria Novosti reported. Throughout the war, the Kremlin has repeatedly laid down red lines, which it has said could provoke a nuclear response if crossed. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Sep. 1 that Russia will change its nuclear doctrine based on an analysis of recent conflicts and the West&apos;s &quot;escalation course.&quot; Work on drafting the doctrinal changes is at &quot;an advanced stage,&quot; Ryabkov reported at the time without revealing any details as to the changes being introduced. &quot;An aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia,&quot; Putin said during the Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. Moscow also retains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack, including if the enemy, using conventional weapons, poses a critical threat to Russia and Belarus, Putin added. The Russian president said these changes were made in agreement with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. According to the new suggestions, Russia may consider the use of nuclear weapons after receiving information about a massive launch of missiles or drones crossing its state border. Putin said that the nuclear &quot;triad&quot; remains the most important guarantee of Russia&apos;s and its citizens&apos; security. The new draft nuclear doctrine also contains an expanded list of countries and military alliances, as well as a list of military threats, he added. The Russian government did not specify a date when the proposals for changes to the nuclear doctrine would come into force. The head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, responded to Putin&apos;s statements by saying that &quot;Russia has nothing else but nuclear blackmail, no other tools to intimidate the world.&quot; &quot;These tools will not work,&quot; he added. Putin approved a nuclear doctrine in 2020, which listed for the first time the threats against which nuclear weapons could be deployed. Among other provisions, it states that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction are used against it or its allies. Russian forces can also deploy their nuclear arsenal in response to any conventional weapons if Russia&apos;s existence is threatened. The country&apos;s president decides on the use of nuclear arms, it adds. Yet, in late February 2024, journalists from the Financial Times (FT) were able to obtain access to secret Russian documents related to Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons. The threshold for the use of these weapons by Russia is much lower than Russian officials have publicly claimed, the FT said. According to the media outlet, the Russian military could also use them to &quot;deter states from aggression&quot; or &quot;escalating military conflicts.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-suggests-number-of-changes-to-russias-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-09-25T12:13:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169947960-1.jpg
There can be no just peace without Ukraine' — Zelensky's full speech at the UN General Assembly	Editor&apos;s Note: The following is the full translated transcript of a speech delivered by President Volodymyr Zelensky at the UN General Assembly on Sept 25. It was published by the President&apos;s Office online and is republished here without changes. Zelensky delivered the address in English. Dear leaders, Your excellencies, Today, I want to tell you about a day that has already passed, and a day that must never come. On the night of March 4th, 2022, I received one of the most terrifying reports since the beginning of a full-scale Russian invasion against Ukraine. The report was about Russian tanks firing directly at the buildings of our Ukrainian nuclear power plant. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The largest one in Europe. Six nuclear reactors. The Russian army stormed this facility just as brutally as any other during this war. Without thinking about the consequences. Possibly disastrous. This was one of the most horrifying moments of the war, when no one could know how Russian strikes on the nuclear facility would end, and everyone in Ukraine was reminded of what Chornobyl means. Now, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains occupied by Russian forces. Unfortunately. And it&#x2019;s at risk of a nuclear incident. This is the major source of radiation danger in Europe, possibly in the world. That&#x2019;s why, in the Peace Formula I presented, the first point is about nuclear safety. In Ukraine, we know exactly what we&#x2019;re dealing with. And I want to thank you &#x2013; the General Assembly members &#x2013; for adopting a resolution in July this year on the safety of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Most in the world understand &#x2013; what&#x2019;s at stake. The General Assembly demanded that Russia return control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukraine. Only then real nuclear security will return to Europe and the world. And now about the day that must never come. Since Russia can&#x2019;t defeat our people&#x2019;s resistance on the battlefield, Putin is looking for other ways to break the Ukrainian spirit. One of his methods is targeting our energy infrastructure. These are deliberate Russian attacks on our power plants, and the entire energy grid. As of today, Russia has destroyed all our thermal power plants and a large part of our hydroelectric capacity. This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2013; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2013; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages. Putin wants to leave them in the dark and cold this winter, forcing Ukraine to suffer and surrender. Just imagine, please, your country with 80 percent of its energy system gone &#x2013; with such a destroyed part of the system. What kind of life would that be? Recently, I received yet another alarming report from our intelligence. Now, Putin does seem to be planning attacks on our nuclear power plants and their infrastructure, aiming to disconnect the plants from the power grid. With the help of satellites, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, by the way, satellites of other countries, Russia is getting images and detailed information about the infrastructure of our nuclear power plants. But what does this really threaten? Any missile or drone strike, any critical incident in the energy system, could lead to a nuclear disaster. A day like that must never come. And Moscow needs to understand this. And this depends, in part, on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. These are nuclear power plants! They must be safe. President Volodymyr Zelensky giving a speech to the UN General Assemnly in New York on Sept. 25 during a trip the the U.S. (President&apos;s Office)&#xA0;Ladies and gentlemen! Two years ago, in the fall of 2022, I proposed a comprehensive strategy to end the war &#x2013; and to ensure security. And I presented the Peace Formula at a highly inclusive political platform for world leaders &#x2013; the G20 Summit in Indonesia &#x2013; representing billions of citizens from all parts of the globe. And it&#x2019;s important for us that all these people can understand us &#x2013; understand that Ukraine wants to end this war more than anyone in the world. War always poses a threat to many. You all see in the media and read in reports what is happening in Ukraine because of Russia&#x2019;s war &#x2013; it&#x2019;s something, many are imagining happening to themselves. And, yes, the smoke from fires in war-torn cities can reach other countries. And if, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won&#x2019;t respect state borders, and unfortunately, various nations could feel the devastating effects. Many are concerned, but the deepest understanding of war is always found in the home it destroys. It is the Ukrainian people who feel the full pain of this war. It&#x2019;s Ukrainian children who are learning to distinguish the sounds of different types of artillery and drones because of Russia&#x2019;s war. It&#x2019;s our people who are forcefully separated by occupation because Putin decided he could do whatever he wants. It&#x2019;s our heroic soldiers who are giving their lives to defend our country from invaders trying to steal our land. That&#x2019;s why we say, rightfully so &#x2013; there can be no just peace without Ukraine. And I thank every leader, every country that supports us in this, that understands us &#x2013; that sees how Russia, a country more than twenty times larger than Ukraine in territory, still wants even more land, more land &#x2013; which is insane &#x2013; and is seizing it, day by day, while wanting to destroy its neighbor. And Russia found very special buddies for that &#x2013; North Korea and Iran, a telling choice of friends. Now every neighbor of Russia in Europe and Central Asia feels that the war could come to them as well, and just think &#x2013; what kind of losses that would mean for the world. And I thank nearly one hundred nations and international organizations that have supported the Peace Formula. It&#x2019;s truly a global community &#x2013; Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, the Pacific region &#x2013; all united by the Peace Formula. And I&#x2019;m glad that the first Peace Summit was so reminding of the UN General Assembly &#x2013; everyone was equal. All nations that participated in the Peace Summit &#x2013; large and small &#x2013; no veto right, no blocking authority. Those that have been independent for ages, and those that have only recently gained independence. Those that have gone through wars themselves, and those accustomed to peace. All. All were equal &#x2013; that is what Russia hates the most and cannot control, that&#x2019;s why Russia says the Peace Formula doesn&#x2019;t suit it. Here at the UN, I&#x2019;ve already met with leaders from India and Guatemala, Japan and Italy, T&#xFC;rkiye and Finland, Canada and Paraguay, Slovenia, Germany and others. And my meetings will continue. These are different, absolutely, parts of the world and various political ways of life, but they share the same understanding &#x2013; peace is needed, and it must be a real, just peace. Unfortunately, at the UN, it&#x2019;s impossible to truly and fairly resolve matters of war and peace because too much depends in the Security Council on the veto power. When the aggressor exercises veto power, the UN is powerless to stop the war. But the Peace Formula can &#x2013; once again, there is no veto power in it. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s the best opportunity for peace &#x2013; everyone is equal, and it&#x2019;s effective and comprehensive. When some propose alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans &#x2013; so-called &apos;sets of principles&apos; &#x2013; it not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians, who are affected by the war the most, it not only ignores reality, but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war and pressure the world to bring more nations under control. Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are, in fact, efforts to achieve a lull instead of an end to the war, as a global initiative &#x2013; the Peace Formula &#x2013; has already existed for two years. And maybe somebody wants a Nobel Prize for their political biography for frozen truce instead of real peace, but the only prizes Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters. We must restore nuclear safety. Energy must stop being used as a weapon. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians forcibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the UN Charter and guarantee our right &#x2013; Ukraine&#x2019;s right &#x2013; to territorial integrity and sovereignty, just as we do for any other nation. We need to withdraw the Russian occupiers, which will bring an end to the hostilities in Ukraine. We must hold those responsible for war crimes accountable. We need to prevent ecocide and stop the destruction of nature caused by the war. And we must not allow a second or third phase of this Russian invasion. And we need to make it clear &#x2013; the war is over. This is the Peace Formula. What part of this could be unacceptable to anyone who upholds the UN Charter? If someone in the world seeks alternatives to any of these points or tries to ignore any of them, it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing &#x2013; the point they ignore reveals the desire they are hiding. And when the Chinese-Brazilian duo tries to grow into a choir of voices &#x2013; with someone in Europe, with someone in Africa, saying something alternative to a full and just peace, the question arises &#x2013; what is the true interest? Everyone must understand &#x2013; you won&#x2019;t boost your power at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense. And the world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers at the expense of those who are smaller. Every country &#x2013; including China, Brazil, European nations, African nations, Middle East &#x2013; all understand why this must remain in the past. And Ukrainians will never accept, will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past, which suits no one today, can be imposed on Ukraine now instead of a normal, peaceful life. I want peace for my people &#x2013; real peace and just peace. And I&#x2019;m asking for your support &#x2013; from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you &#x2013; do not divide the world. Be united Nations, and that will bring us peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!	https://kyivindependent.com/there-can-be-no-just-peace-without-ukraine-zelenskys-full-speech-at-the-un-general-assembly/	2024-09-25T11:44:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/b52349f90283f7dd654e9fb2e49e20e1_1727278641_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia preparing to attack 3 nuclear power plants in Ukraine, Zelensky says	Key developments on Sept. 25: Russia is preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Sept. 24. &quot;If Russia is ready to go that far, it means nothing you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will keep striking if it&#x2019;s given any room in the world,&quot; he said. Zelensky did not specify which stations are under threat but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. There have been mounting warnings from Kyiv in recent days about such attacks. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 24, Zelensky said that Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat. Russian troops have not yet reached the outskirts of the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Sept. 25. &quot;There is no enemy on the outskirts of the town yet. Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he said on national television. &quot;Our defenders are doing everything possible and impossible. They burned a lot of enemy equipment.&quot; The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Filashkin said Russian forces are trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense line near Vuhledar and &quot;are advancing.&quot; According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState, Russian forces are aiming to encircle the town. Around 100 people remain in Vuhledar refusing to leave, Filashkin added. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk, Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Sept. 25. Speaking to national television, a HUR special forces officer with the call sign Viking revealed details of the operation, adding that a further four Russian soldiers &quot;tried to leave the plant and were neutralized outside the perimeter.&quot; &quot;The battle lasted a little over a week. There was intense shelling from the enemy. The enemy at the factory put up a lot of resistance, but in the end, we completed the task,&quot; he said. Russian troops had been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months before the facility was recaptured on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;The plant is destroyed and damaged. But it is possible to maintain a defense there,&quot; Viking said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation,&quot; HUR said in a statement on Sept. 24, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by the agency&apos;s special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it claimed. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took the territory of the aggregate plant under control after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. Ukraine has developed a three-year plan for the production of drones, electronic warfare equipment, and ground robotic systems, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24. Described as &quot;very thorough and extensive,&quot; the document on Ukrainian manufacturing was presented during Umerov&apos;s recent trips to the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, as well as at the Ramstein meeting earlier this month. &quot;We looked at how many of them (drones, electronic warfare, ground robotic systems) we needed and how we would use them at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,&quot; the minister said. The plan also includes the specific number of weapons that Ukraine can produce and the funds needed, Umerov added without elaborating. &quot;There are already several countries today that have agreed to finance our drones and missiles,&quot; Umerov added. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. According to Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology. Kyiv says it uses domestically-produced drones to hit targets on Russian soil amid ongoing pressure on its partners to lift restrictions on deep strikes with Western-supplied weapons. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said in July. Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet. According to the report, Russia has flight-tested a new drone called the Garpiya-3 (G3) in China with the help of local specialists. Details of the project were revealed in a report by the company behind the project, IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of the Kremlin-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In a comment to Reuters, China&apos;s foreign ministry denied knowledge of the G3 project. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-sept-25/	2024-09-25T11:39:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg

Russia has destroyed all thermal power plants, nearly all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine ahead of winter, Zelensky says	Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Putin wants to leave them in the dark and cold this winter, forcing Ukraine to suffer and surrender. Just imagine, please, your country with 80 percent of its energy system gone &#x2014; with such a destroyed part of the system. What kind of life would that be?&quot; the president added. From October 2022 to September 2024, Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure facilities suffered 1024 Russian attacks, according to the Energy Ministry. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-destroys-all-thermal-power-plants-nearly-all-hydroelectric-capacity-in-ukraine-ahead-of-winter-zelensky-says/	2024-09-25T11:07:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170870951.jpg
Zelensky's stance on 'forcing' Russia to make peace 'fatal mistake,' Kremlin says	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance on &quot;forcing&quot; Russia to peace is a &quot;fatal mistake&quot; and will have &quot;consequences for Ukraine,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sept. 25, according to Russia&apos;s state-owned Ria Novosti outlet. Peskov&apos;s statement comes after Zelensky&apos;s speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, in which he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had violated so many international laws that he would not stop &quot;on his own, so Russia could only be forced to peace.&quot; &quot;In my view, this stance is a fatal mistake. A fatal mistake, a systemic mistake, this is a profound misconception, which, of course, will inevitably have consequences for (Ukraine),&quot; Peskov said in answer to a question about Zelensky&apos;s speech. Peskov said that Russia &quot;could not be forced to peace, adding that Moscow is allegedly &quot;committed to peace,&quot; despite its war in Ukraine. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, kicking off a nearly week-long visit focused on presenting the president&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. Zelensky and Biden will meet at the White House on Sept. 26. Kyiv has remained secretive about the plan&apos;s details. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military aid with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. In addition to a NATO invitation and a pledge for arms supplies, Bloomberg previously reported that the plan includes a clear pathway to European Union membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-stance-on-forcing-russia-to-make-peace-fatal-mistake-kremlin-says/	2024-09-25T09:47:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Russia attacks Kramatorsk city center, killing 2, injuring 12, including children	Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 25, killing at least two and injuring 12 people, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Three children are among the injured, he added. Russia targeted the city center with three guided aerial bombs, damaging two high-rise buildings, shops, and cars. Emergency services are working at the scene, according to Filashkin. The aftermath of the Russian strike against the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 25, 2024. (Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin / Telegram)&quot;This is another war crime by the Russians and another sad reminder that there are no safe places left in Donetsk Oblast,&quot; Filashkin wrote on his Telegram, encouraging remaining local residents to evacuate. Kramatorsk comes under regular Russian attacks. A strike on a restaurant in the city center, popular with volunteers, journalists, and soldiers, in June 2023 killed 13 people and injured dozens of others. The well-known Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina was seriously injured in the June 2023 strike and later died in hospital.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kramatorsk-city-center-killing-2-injuring-12/	2024-09-25T08:57:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-25-17_55_05.jpeg
Death toll in Russia's Sept. 24 attack on Kharkiv rises to 4	The death toll in the Sept. 24 Russian attack on Kharkiv has risen to four people, as rescuers found the body of a woman under the rubble of a damaged building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on Sept. 25. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts. Two high-rise residential buildings were struck in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. The attack killed a total of four people and injured 34. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov. The woman&apos;s body was found on Sept. 25 under the rubble of the building in the Kyivskyi district, which Russian forces attacked for the second time since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Following the first strike, the building was repaired, insulated, and prepared for winter, but it was hit again by a Russian guided aerial bomb. Some 82 people lived in the section that had suffered the most severe damage, according to Terekhov. The recent Russian strikes also damaged a bakery plant, a recreation center, a sports ground, a kindergarten, several windows in apartment buildings, and a supermarket. Russia reportedly used FAB-250 and FAB-500 guided aerial bombs. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian attacks for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/death-toll-in-russias-sept-24-attack-on-kharkiv-rises-to-4/	2024-09-25T08:20:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419941.jpg
Lammy calls Putin head of 'mafia state,' compares him to slave owner	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of running a &quot;mafia state&quot; and compared him to a slave owner during his speech at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24. Lammy, who took over as British Foreign Secretary in July 2024, has consistently reiterated his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and condemned Russia&apos;s attacks against Ukrainian civilians and violations of international law. Lammy criticized Putin&apos;s actions regarding the invasion of Ukraine, recalling the days of slavery, and accused the Russian government of flouting international law, while claiming to be defending the so-called Global South. &quot;Your invasion is in your own interests,&quot; he said, addressing Putin. &quot;Yours alone. To expand your mafia state into a mafia empire. An empire built on corruption.&quot; &quot;Mr. President (Putin), I speak not only as a Briton, as a Londoner, and as a foreign secretary. &quot; &quot;But I say to the Russian representative (in the U.N. Security Council), on his phone as I speak, that I stand here also as a Black man whose ancestors were taken in chains from Africa, at the barrel of a gun to be enslaved, whose ancestors rose up and fought in a great rebellion of the enslaved,&quot; Lammy added. U.K. Foreign Secretary said that he recognizes &quot;imperialism&quot; in the actions of the Russian authorities, adding that &quot;he will call it out for what it is.&quot; Lammy delivered his speech at the U.N. Security Council as Ukraine continues to seek permission to use long-range Western weapons, including British-made Storm Shadow missiles, to strike deep into Russia. Storm Shadow missiles are only allowed to be used on Ukraine&apos;s territory for now. Ukraine has reportedly used Storm Shadow missiles, with a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The Telegraph reported in August, citing unnamed sources, that the U.K. was privately in favor of allowing Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles in strikes on Russia, but was unwilling to publicly press for such a change in policy due to fears of backlash from the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/lammy-calls-putin-head-of-mafia-state-compares-him-to-slave-owner/	2024-09-25T07:34:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172936127.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Hotels and tax hikes	The following is the Sept. 25, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Kyiv&#x2019;s iconic &#x201C;Hotel Ukraina,&#x201D; located on the city&#x2019;s central Independence Square, also known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti, was sold in an auction for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million) after being state-owned since its construction in 1961. Why now? It may seem strange that such a large asset was privatized during a full-scale war. The auction is actually part of the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;Big Privatization&#x201D; initiative to offload its long list of state-owned properties to raise money for the country&#x2019;s wartime budget needs. Privatization is a tricky subject in this part of the world. While it was supposed to facilitate a transition from a planned to a market economy in the wake of the USSR&#x2019;s collapse, mass privatization in the 1990s did little else besides help a few oligarchs get really rich buying valuable state assets for really cheap. Many major enterprises in the country never got privatized. In fact, the Ukrainian government is still the largest owner of assets in the country, with thousands of companies owned by the state. In 2020, the Economy Ministry put the number at 3,343. The figure has undoubtedly only gotten larger during the full-scale invasion, as the state has nationalized some companies, many of which were owned by Russians or other sanctioned individuals. The sale of Hotel Ukraina is one of the first large-scale privatizations in recent years, which seems like a win for the state&#x2019;s privatization efforts. The highest bidder? Little-known Ukrainian businessman Maksym Krippa, who seems to be on a bit of a shopping spree in Kyiv real estate these days. He partly owns the nearby Dnipro Hotel and in 2023, bought the Parus skyscraper in downtown Kyiv. He also owns a few, smaller business centers in the city. In addition to real estate, Krippa is also the owner of the Ukrainian e-sports team Navi, as well as the well-known Stalker video game series. In a brief, written interview for Forbes Ukraine after the Hotel Ukraina bid, Krippa said his business interests also include IT. Regarding the hotel, Krippa declined to divulge any details on how he plans to invest in the property &#x2014; in need of serious capital to bring it into the modern age &#x2014; but reassured Forbes that he and his team &#x201C;have a plan on how to develop the facility.&#x201D; But Krippa also told Forbes that no renovations would start until the war is over and Ukraine is victorious. In other words, the property may have switched hands, but its development is likely still a distant prospect. &#x201C;I don&apos;t even know what to say. This is a nightmare. This will hit the white business hard,&#x201D; Tatyana Izovit, chairman of the board of the Ukrainian Association of enterprises of textile &amp; leather industry, told told Liga.net, referring to the recent tax increase passed in the first reading by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. If you&#x2019;ve been following our reporting on the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s moves to raise taxes &#x2014; the first time since the start of the full-scale war &#x2014; you&#x2019;ve likely seen that businesses in Ukraine feel the increase is totally unfair. In their view, the government should go after illegal businesses and goods that cause billions of dollars of losses in unpaid taxes to the state instead of tax-paying individuals and businesses, known as white businesses in Ukraine. A lot of these losses are often the result of corruption schemes in customs. But the war is raging and Ukraine needs to bring more money to the budget. Raising taxes is one way to do that &#x2014; and good news is, the president will soon sign a new customs reform bill into law. It will likely take years, and a lot of work, for those reforms to really take effect, but it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction.

(Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Ukrainian drones take aim at Russia&#x2019;s energy sectorWhile Russian missiles and drones attempt to cripple Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and will by targeting its vital energy system, Ukraine&#x2019;s military is hitting back with its own attacks on Russia&#x2019;s oil refining capabilities. Since the start of the year, Ukrainian drones have hit around 33 oil assets, mostly refineries, in Russia, OSINT group Liveuamap told the Kyiv Independent. The viral videos of drones slamming into refineries have boosted morale in Ukraine and undermined the Kremlin. But the tangible impact may not be as great as Ukraine initially hoped.

Ukraine&#x2019;s largest steel plant, located in the city of Kryvyi Rih, said that it is facing reduced levels of production and has lowered its forecast, citing a drop in global prices for iron ore, slowing steel markets in Europe, and the high cost of electricity in Ukraine, as well as frequent blackouts brought on by Russian attacks. Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, about one-third of the expected peak demand, International Energy Agency head Fatih Birol told FT. &quot;It&apos;s time for everybody to understand that this winter could be consequential in Ukraine,&quot; Birol said. In other news, the EU plans to help cover 25% of Ukraine&apos;s energy needs this winter. The Sept. 23 meeting at the bank&#x2019;s headquarters in New York reportedly included its president of international operations Bernard Mensah, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. Speaking alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a joint press conference, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the 35 billion euros would be used for energy needs, bomb shelters, and defense purposes. Agriculture Minister Georgi Takhov said on Sept. 19 that Bulgarian producers are facing difficulties due to the growth of imports from Ukraine, hindering competition in the domestic market.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-hotels-and-tax-hikes/	2024-09-25T06:56:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159002883.jpg
No Russian troops on Vuhledar outskirts, governor claims	Russian troops have not yet reached the outskirts of the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Sept. 25. &quot;There is no enemy on the outskirts of the town yet. Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he said on national television. &quot;Our defenders are doing everything possible and impossible. They burned a lot of enemy equipment.&quot; The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Filashkin said Russian forces are trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense line near Vuhledar and &quot;are advancing.&quot; According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState, Russian forces are aiming to encircle the town. Estimated Russian advance in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Sept. 25, 2024. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Around 100 people remain in Vuhledar refusing to leave, Filashkin added. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-russian-troops-on-vuhledar-outskirts-governor-claims/	2024-09-25T06:11:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1770373976.jpg
Zelensky meets with NATO's Stoltenberg in New York	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in New York on Sept. 25, thanking him for &quot;supporting Ukraine throughout his tenure.&quot; In a post on social media, Zelensky said the pair discussed several issues, including &quot;the need to enhance Ukraine&apos;s air defense, (and) the continued efforts on an invitation for our state to join NATO as soon as possible.&quot; Stoltenberg is stepping down as NATO Secretary General next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will take his place. Zelensky is in the U.S. this week where is expected to present his victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. An invitation to join NATO is part of the plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 24. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022, half a year into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.

The countries affirmed Kyiv&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, though Ukraine did not receive any definitive news about its future accession. Biden said that peace in Ukraine means a guarantee that Russia will never occupy the country again, but Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO is not necessary for this. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-natos-stoltenberg-in-new-york/	2024-09-25T05:48:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161907479.jpg
Military intelligence reveals details of operation to recapture Vovchansk aggregate plant	Ukrainian forces captured around 24 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Sept. 25. Speaking to national television, a HUR special forces officer with the call sign Viking revealed details of the operation, adding a further four Russian soldiers &quot;tried to leave the plant and were neutralized outside the perimeter.&quot; &quot;The battle lasted a little over a week. There was intense shelling from the enemy. The enemy at the factory put up a lot of resistance, but in the end we completed the task,&quot; he said. Russian troops had been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months before the facility was recaptured on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;The plant is destroyed and damaged. But it is possible to maintain a defense there,&quot; Viking said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation,&quot; HUR said in a statement on Sept. 24, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by the agency&apos;s special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it claimed. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took the territory of the aggregate plant under control after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/vovchansk-aggregate-plant-recaptured-hur/	2024-09-25T04:52:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-25-141806.png
Russia establishes secret attack drone programme in China, Reuters reports	Russia has secretly established a development and production programme in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet. According to the report, Russia has flight-tested a new drone called the Garpiya-3 (G3) in China with the help of local specialists. Details of the project were revealed in a report by the company behind the project, IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of the Kremlin-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In a comment to Reuters, China&apos;s foreign ministry denied knowledge of the G3 project. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-establishes-secret-attack-drone-programme-in-china-reuters-reports/	2024-09-25T04:18:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172181156.jpg
Ukraine has 'extensive' 3-year plan for drone, ground robotics production, defense minister says	Ukraine has developed a three-year plan for the production of drones, electronic warfare equipment and ground robotic systems, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24. Described as &quot;very thorough and extensive,&quot; the document on Ukrainian manufacturing was presented during Umerov&apos;s recent trips to the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, as well as at the Ramstein meeting earlier this month. &quot;We looked at how many of them (drones, electronic warfare, ground robotic systems) we needed and how we would use them at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,&quot; the minister said. The plan also includes the specific number of weapons that Ukraine can produce and the funds needed, Umerov added without elaborating. &quot;There are already several countries today that have agreed to finance our drones and missiles,&quot; Umerov added. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. According to Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology. Kyiv says it uses domestically-produced drones to hit targets on Russian soil amid ongoing pressure on its partners to lift restrictions on deep strikes with Western-supplied weapons. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-3-year-plan/	2024-09-25T03:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Lula pushes China-Brazil 6-point peace plan at UN, already dismissed by Ukraine as 'destructive'	Brazil&apos;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva touted his peace plan jointly developed with China at the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, despite the proposal already being dismissed as &quot;destructive&quot; by Ukraine. Condemning the &quot;invasion of Ukrainian territory,&quot; Lula said it was now &quot;crucial&quot; to create the conditions needed for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;This is the message of the six-point understanding that China and Brazil are offering to establish a process of dialogue and an end to hostilities,&quot; he added. China and Brazil first put forward the plan in May, setting it up as an alternative to Ukraine&apos;s own efforts of initiating peace negotiations and ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The timing of the proposal, not to mention China and Brazil&apos;s friendly stances towards Russia, have called into question what their vision of peace would actually mean for Ukraine. According to Reuters, Lula&apos;s foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim will meet with representatives of 20 countries in New York on Friday in an effort to garner support. The outlet said Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates are among those who have been invited, but Ukraine&apos;s staunchest allies would not attend. The six-point plan, proposed by China and Brazil, refers to the war as a &quot;crisis&quot; and calls for: It makes no mention of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. China and Brazil proposed and prompted the plan in parallel to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula. Zelensky&#x2019;s plan calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, punishing those responsible for war crimes, and the release of all prisoners, among other goals. A major part of the push for Ukraine&apos;s plan was a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite an invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Metropoles published on Sept. 12, Zelensky was scathing about the six-point plan, describing it as &quot;destructive.&quot; &quot;You either support the war, or you don&apos;t support the war. If you don&apos;t support it, then help us stop Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(Should we) just give up our land, forget that they are killing our people? &quot;What is the compromise in that? That&apos;s why I think it&apos;s destructive. It&apos;s just a political statement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/lula-pushes-china-brazil-6-point-peace-plan-at-un-already-dismissed-by-ukraine-as-destructive/	2024-09-25T02:34:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173393786.jpg
Iran mediating secret talks to send Russian anti-ship missiles to Yemen's Houthis, Reuters reports	Iran is brokering secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen&apos;s Houthis to transfer Yakhont supersonic anti-ship missiles to them, Reuters reported on Sept. 24, citing seven unnamed sources. Representatives of the Iran-backed Houthi group and Moscow met in Tehran at least twice in 2024, two officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. The talks on the supply of &quot;dozens&quot; of missiles are ongoing, and new meetings in Tehran are expected in the coming weeks, the news agency reported. The Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group located in Yemen. Following Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza, the Houthis began launching attacks against shipping vessels in the Red Sea. &quot;The Iranians are brokering the talks but do not want to have their signature over it,&quot; a Western intelligence source said. The Kremlin has reportedly not yet made a final decision on deliveries of the Yakhont missiles, also known as P-800 Oniks, which have a range of about 300 kilometers. Experts believe that such a move will allow the militant group to attack commercial vessels more precisely and increase the threat to the U.S. and European warships defending them, according to Reuters. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. After months of contradictory reports, the U.S. on Sept. 10 confirmed that Iran had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia in what could prove a dramatic development for Ukraine. To date, no Iranian ballistic missiles are known to have been fired at Ukraine by Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 11 at the Crimean Platform in Kyiv, attended by a Kyiv Independent reporter. But with larger warheads and being far more difficult to intercept, they pose a much greater threat than Shaheds. In a statement on Sept. 7, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said the move &quot;will have devastating consequences for Ukrainian-Iranian bilateral relations.&quot; Ukraine, European Union, and the U.S. have recently introduced more sanctions against Tehran in the wake of the confirmation of the ballistic missile delivery to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran/	2024-09-25T02:09:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172431775.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 11, injure 69 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least 11 people and injured 69 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 25. Ukrainian forces downed 28 out of 32 Shahed-type drones and all four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions, it added. Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, killing at least three people and injuring 36 others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russia attacked the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Four districts in the city were attacked, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. One suffered a direct hit. The number of casualties may increase as the rescue operation is still ongoing. Military personnel look at the destroyed house following a Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv on Sept. 24, 2024.

Russian forces also attacked the village of Varvarivka with a first-person-view (FPV) drone, killing a 61-year-old man, Syniehubov said. Two more people were injured. A Russian overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least seven people, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. A 55-year-old man was killed in a Russian attack near the town of Polohy in the region. Russian attacks on the Nova Sloboda community in Sumy Oblast killed a civilian, local authorities reported. One person was killed in the town of Kostiantynivka and two others in the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A total of five people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, he added. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 20 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 18 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day/	2024-09-25T01:19:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419948.jpg
Russia preparing to attack 3 nuclear plants in Ukraine, Zelensky tells UN	Russia is preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Sept. 24. &quot;If Russia is ready to go that far, it means nothing you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will keep striking if it&#x2019;s given any room in the world,&quot; he said. Zelensky did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. There have been mounting warnings from Kyiv in recent days about such attacks. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants (NPP) and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 24, Zelensky said that Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-to-attack-3-ukraines-nuclear-plants-zelensky-says/	2024-09-24T23:55:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173438114.jpg
Ukraine responds after Czech president's 'temporary Russian occupation' comments	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Sept. 24 reiterated that the full withdrawal of Russian troops from all occupied territories is necessary for a &quot;just and lasting peace,&quot; after the president of Czechia said Kyiv should be &quot;realistic&quot; about achieving such a goal. In an interview with The New York Times (NYT) published on Sept. 23, Petr Pavel said the &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said, adding Kyiv needed to be &quot;realistic.&quot; In a statement on its website that didn&apos;t mention Pavel by name, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said there can be &quot;no middle-ground solutions,&quot; and the full withdrawal of Russian troops was &quot;a realistic scenario.&quot; &quot;The withdrawal of Russian occupying forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders is one of the mandatory points of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Peace Formula,&quot; it added. &quot;This and other provisions of the Formula will guarantee a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace not only for Ukraine, but for the entire European continent and the world.&quot; As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine. Pavel later on Sept. 24 responded to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry statement, saying he had previously &quot;warned against unrealistic expectations.&quot; &quot;I have never questioned that we should support Ukraine in restoring its territorial integrity, that this is the ultimate goal. We just have to be realistic about the time horizon and the cost of achieving that goal,&quot; he told journalists in New York. &quot;Defeating Russia in Ukraine at the cost of killing half the Ukrainian population is probably not a victory.&quot; Ukraine says peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Zelensky is also expected to present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to President Joe Biden during his ongoing visit to the U.S. this week. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-responds-after-czech-presidents-temporary-russian-occupation-comments/	2024-09-24T23:23:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160820762.jpg
No Zelensky-Trump meeting scheduled in US this week, AP reports	No meetings have been scheduled between former U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Sept. 25, citing an unnamed official on Trump&#x2019;s campaign. As Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S. continues, he is expected to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden to present a victory plan at the White House on Sept. 26. It was also reported that he planned to discuss it with presidential candidates Trump and Kamala Harris. Last week, Ukraine&apos;s president said that he would most likely meet with Trump on Sept. 26-27, without providing further details. &quot;The main thing is to have time. I will not look into the future, but I think it will be important for both of us,&quot; Zelensky told journalists. But according to the official cited by AP, no meeting has yet been scheduled between Trump and Zelensky. Kyiv has not commented on AP&apos;s reports. Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The former president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris. In his recent remarks, Trump criticized America&apos;s involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is &quot;stuck&quot; and will only be able to &quot;get out&quot; if he wins the election. Zelensky and Trump held the first in five years call in July. According to Ukraine&apos;s president, Trump told him he is &quot;very supportive,&quot; and would do &quot;everything to strengthen Ukraine&quot; if elected president.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-zelensky-trump-meetings-scheduled-in-us-this-week-ap-reports/	2024-09-24T23:06:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 646,400 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 646,400 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 25. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,815 tanks, 17,304 armored fighting vehicles, 25,248 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,549 artillery systems, 1,199 multiple launch rocket systems, 952 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 15,879 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-646-400-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-09-24T22:18:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2164069605-1.jpg
Zelensky says Russia can't be calmed by talks alone	President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that peace cannot be achieved through negotiations alone, but that Russia must be forced to end the war. Zelensky has been rallying support from Western leaders for his &quot;victory plan&quot; to bring an end to the war, which began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He emphasized that the war will eventually conclude, but not because &quot;someone got tired of the war&quot; or through a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, rejecting proposals to cede Ukrainian territory as a means to resolve the conflict. &quot;This war can&apos;t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,&quot; Zelensky said, thanking nations that have supported Ukraine. &quot;Putin has violated so many international norms and rules that he won&apos;t stop on his own. Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what&apos;s needed&#x2014;forcing Russia into peace, as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.&quot; Zelensky also condemned North Korea and Iran for supplying weapons to Russia, calling them &quot;de facto accomplices&quot; of Moscow. Zelensky believes that if his strategy gains Western backing, it could exert significant pressure on Moscow, potentially influencing Putin to seek a diplomatic end to the conflict. While he&apos;s shared few specifics about the &quot;victory plan,&quot; Zelensky has indicated that it would pave the way for a second Ukraine-led peace summit, which Kyiv intends to host later this year and invite Russia to attend. Russia has recently announced it will not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit. During the U.N. Security Council meeting, Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia criticized the inclusion of Zelensky, dismissing the focus on Ukraine. &quot;Western countries could not refrain from poisoning the atmosphere once again, trying to fill the air time with the hackneyed Ukrainian issue,&quot; Nebenzia was quoted as saying.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-russia-cant-be-calmed-by-talks-alone/	2024-09-24T21:30:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173251936.jpg
UK's Lammy aims to secure strongest support for Ukraine	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Sept. 24 that he is working to ensure Ukraine is in the &quot;strongest position&quot; in its war against Russia ahead of the winter months. While Lammy refrained from confirming whether the U.K. would authorize Ukraine to use British long-range precision weapons to strike inside Russia, he acknowledged that Iran&apos;s supply of ballistic missiles to Moscow has marked a &quot;major escalation.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has long requested permission to use British Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS to hit targets deeper within Russia. However, U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer postponed a decision during their meeting on Sept. 13. Lammy, speaking in New York at the U.N. General Assembly, said he didn&#x2019;t want to grant Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;any operational advantage,&quot; but emphasized that &quot;the most important thing is to put Ukraine in the strongest position&quot; as winter approaches, AFP reported. The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine and has pledged a total of &#xA3;12.8 billion (approximately $16.2 billion) in support for Ukraine, which includes &#xA3;7.8 billion (around $9.9 billion) allocated for military assistance and &#xA3;5 billion (approximately $6.3 billion) designated for non-military support. Lammy&#x2019;s remarks followed his speech at the U.N. Security Council, where he criticized Russia&#x2019;s actions, accusing Moscow of violating international law and targeting civilian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-lammy-aims-to-secure-strongest-support-for-ukraine/	2024-09-24T18:50:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170653139.jpg
Trump vows to 'get America out' of Ukraine war, blames Biden for conflict	At a rally in Atlanta on Sept. 24, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized America&apos;s involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is &quot;stuck&quot; and will only be able to &quot;get out&quot; if he wins the election. Trump claimed that &quot;Biden and Kamala (Harris) got us into this war in Ukraine, and now they can&apos;t get us out,&quot; while promising to &quot;settle the war in Ukraine&quot; if elected. &quot;But we&apos;re stuck in that war unless I&apos;m president. I&#x2019;ll get it done. I&#x2019;ll get it negotiated. I&#x2019;ll get out. We gotta get out,&quot; Trump said. He also described President Volodymyr Zelensky as &quot;the greatest salesman on Earth,&quot; alleging that each of Zelensky&apos;s visits to the U.S. results in receiving &quot;a hundred billion.&quot; Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-vows-to-get-america-out-of-ukraine-war-blames-biden-for-conflict/	2024-09-24T17:46:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170263973.jpg
Small percentage of artillery shells from Czech-led initiative malfunction	A few issues have been reported with some of the artillery shells received through the Czech initiative, according to German publication Handelsblatt, which cited a letter from Kyiv to Prague. Czechia unveiled the international initiative earlier this year amid Ukraine&apos;s shell shortages caused largely by delays in U.S. assistance. Through the initiative, Prague had identified 500,000 155 mm shells and 300,000 122 mm shells outside Europe that could be bought and sent to Ukraine after the necessary funds were allocated to the initiative. A small portion of the received shells have exploded prematurely during combat, leading to injuries and damage to artillery systems. Approximately 0.05% of nearly 35,000 artillery shells had this issue, with five out of every 10,000 breaking prematurely. According to Ukrainian officials, the malfunctions were due to older detonators from World War II, resulting in &quot;numerous explosions at a distance of 20 to 60 meters from the muzzle.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously expressed gratitude for Czech President Petr Pavel&#x2019;s initiative and support. Czechia&#x2019;s support for Ukraine has gone beyond artillery ammunition. The country was the first one to provide main battle tanks to Ukraine, in addition to helicopters, multiple rocket launchers, armored vehicles, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/small-percentage-of-artillery-shells-from-czech-led-initiative-malfunction/	2024-09-24T14:56:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2163779496.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Fighting for Vovchansk continues, Kyiv restores control over aggregate plant	Key developments on Sept. 24: Ukrainian forces recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 24. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation&quot; earlier in the day, the agency said in a statement, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by HUR special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in battles with the enemy in densely urbanized conditions,&quot; it added. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took under control the territory of the aggregate plant after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces),&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. During the operation, Ukrainian troops also reportedly took Russian captives. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify this information. Russian troops have been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months. During the operation, Russian soldiers attacked Ukrainian soldiers with kamikaze attack drones, guided aerial bombs, and continued intensive shelling with TOS-1 &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 24, killing at least three and injuring 34 people, local authorities reported. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported at around 3:30 p.m. local time. Kharkiv&apos;s four districts were under attack, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. Terekhov said that Russia used eight FAB-250 bombs in the attack, while Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that one of the strikes was carried out with a FAB-500 bomb. One of the high-rise buildings came under a direct Russian strike, according to Syniehubov. People are trapped under the rubble; emergency services are continuing search and rescue operations at the scene, Syniehubov added. The aftermath of the Russian strike at a backery in the city of Kharkiv on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleg Syniehubov / Telegram)Terekhov said that one of the buildings, which was damaged in the Kyivskyi district, had already been attacked in the beginning of the full-scale invasion. According to the mayor, it was almost repaired, insulated, and prepared for the heating season before Russian forces struck it again. Some 82 people lived in the section of the building that suffered the most severe damage, Terekhov said. &quot;We are now trying to contact all of them to find out if people are under the rubble,&quot; he added. One of the strikes also hit a food industry enterprise, Terekhov said. The local authorities later clarified that Russia attacked a bakery plant with a FAB-500 gliding aerial bomb, killing one person and injuring eight others. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman. The majority of the injured are in moderate condition, with four people in serious condition. Three people are in surgery as of 6 p.m. local time, according to Syniehubov. The Kremlin will maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24 citing draft budget proposals seen by the outlet. With no immediate end to the war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. NATO countries have set a goal to spend 2 percent of the country&#x2019;s GDP on defense in 2024. Russia is spending around 6 percent. Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that backed growth until now, it was reported on Aug. 9. Labor resources are practically drained while the competition between the military and business for recruits becomes more fierce. This is likely to limit the further growth of defense-related industries. The banking and construction sectors are no longer protected from the impacts of high interest rates as the government shuts down the state-subsidized mortgage programs. Despite Russia&apos;s GDP growing by 4% in the first quarter of the year, it will likely slow down to 2% in the last half of the year and hit 0.5% - 1.5% in 2025, says Alex Isakov, Russia economist at Bloomberg Economics. Most of the foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield against Ukraine come from China, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, said on Sept. 24. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and became Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fueling the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. &quot;If you take all the usual types of weapons and count the foreign made components, about 60% would be coming from China,&quot; Vlasiuk said in comments reported by Reuters, calling Beijing &quot;the biggest problem.&quot; Vlasiuk said that Kyiv held talks with some manufacturers on the issue, without providing further details. Important parts used in surveillance systems, drones and missiles also come from countries including the U.S., the Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland, he added. Despite extensive Western sanctions aimed at cutting off supply lines, Russia continues to obtain sanctioned goods, such as microchips, via third-party countries. Kyiv&apos;s allies have sought to halt the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent sanctions. One of the EU&apos;s sanctions package included a ban for third-country entities to re-export sensitive goods to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia uses dozens of critical components from abroad to produce all its missiles. Missiles launched at Kyiv in one of the spring attacks had an estimated total of 1,500 foreign parts. The &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Czech President Petr Pavel said in an interview published on Sept. 23. Speaking to The New York Times (NYT), Pavel said neither Ukraine nor Russia should expect to achieve outright victory. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said. As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-restores-control-over-aggregate-plant-in-kharkiv-oblasts-vovchansk-military-intelligence-says/	2024-09-24T13:20:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-24-155839.png
Despite hardships, head of Kryvyi Rih steel plant ArcelorMittal determined to keep operations running	Mauro Longobardo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, addressed the company&apos;s current situation and future plans, noting both progress and significant obstacles. He acknowledged the company&apos;s recovery efforts but highlighted the challenges they continue to face in 2024, including falling iron ore prices and stagnation in the European steel market. &quot;For our survival, the company needs to achieve at least minimal financial stability,&quot; Longobardo wrote on X. He also said that over 3,000 employees are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, with 233 colleagues either killed or missing in action during the war. Despite these hardships, Longobardo reaffirmed the company&apos;s commitment to overcoming these difficulties and sustaining operations. In the early months of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, ArcelorMittal workers were forced to shut down the plant. The company manages the ongoing power outages caused by frequent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure by using powerful diesel generators and rotating electricity between different parts of the plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-hardships-head-of-kryvyi-rih-steel-plant-arcelormittal-determined-to-keep-operations-running/	2024-09-24T13:16:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Metal-Factory-v2_00_00_09_00_Still043.png
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 74	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 74 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Sept. 16- Sept. 22, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The draft law on customs reform was sent to the president for signing. On Sept. 23, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk signed draft law #6490-d on the restart of the State Customs Service and it was sent to the President&apos;s Office. The bill will come into effect after the president signs it. The Parliament adopted in the first reading the draft law on increasing taxes. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the first reading draft law #11416-d on tax increase. It was the second attempt after the previous rejection of the bill in the parliament and its revision by the Tax Committee. The draft law suggests the record high increase of taxes to ensure additional budget revenues of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) till the end of 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025. As we reported earlier, the revised version has only one update which raises the bank profit tax rate up to 50%. Lawmakers have two weeks to submit amendments to the draft law, so it can be considered the second reading not earlier than in mid-October. It means that the provision of the draft law may be applied retroactively as the text suggests they should come into effect from Oct. 1. The Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law with amendments to the State Budget 2024. Last week, the parliament voted for draft law #11417 on increasing defense spending by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) in the final reading. Thus, in 2024 Ukraine will have the record high budget spending of Hr 3.73 trillion ($90 billion). The Verkhovna Rada supported in the first reading the Accounting Chamber reform. The Parliament adopted in the first reading draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber. The draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the ACU&#x2019;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the Accounting Chamber to all public finances, strengthening its independence, reducing a number of the ACU&#x2019;s members from 13 to 11, and introducing external audit with experts with international auditing experience. Last week the parliament adopted four draft laws from the World Bank requirements. During the parliamentary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada adopted four draft laws in the final reading and one draft law in the first reading which Ukraine was obliged to adopt within the agreements with the World Bank. The Parliament adopted in the final reading draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies and #11474 to address the issue of privatization of the state banks which will be sold transparently via Prozorro.Sale platform. Moreover, the Verkhovna Rada fully adopted draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register and #10143 with the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code which are also obligations to the EU under the Ukraine Plan of Ukraine Facility. Furthermore, the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the first reading the new draft law #11520 on public procurements. Me and my colleagues are preparing several proposals to the draft law in the second reading regarding closing abuses currently allowed by exceptions to the law. Ukraine unlocked large-scale privatization. Hotel &quot;Ukraina&#x201D;in Kyiv was sold in an auction for Hr 2.5 billion (approx $60 million) via online platform Prozorro.Sale. It&apos;s the first case of large-scale privatization after it was allowed by law. During the auction the price increased 2.5 times from the starting price. The Verkhovna Rada obliged SOEs to publish detailed prices of procurements for construction works. The Parliament adopted in the final reading the draft law #11057 on changes in public procurement procedures for the SOEs and required from the state contracting authorities to publish the detailed cost estimate of construction works under the signed contracts. As we reported in Issue 48, currently several provisions, including those adopted due to the martial law, give the SOEs a right not to show the detailed cost estimate within the procurements related to construction works which leads to abuse of the provision by SOEs. The Cabinet of Ministers presented the 2025 state budget in the parliament. On Sept. 20, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko presented the 2025 Draft Budget to the Verkhovna Rada according to the budget process procedure in Ukraine. Lawmakers will submit their amendments by Oct. 1 and the parliament has to vote for the draft law on the State Budget for 2025 for the first time not later than Oct. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-74/	2024-09-24T13:13:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
Russian troops aim to encircle Vuhledar, Ukraine's last fortress in southern Donbas	The long-embattled town of Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southeastern part of Donetsk Oblast, is under threat of encirclement and is being &quot;razed to the ground,&quot; according to reports on Sept. 24. Located 50 kilometers south of Pokrovsk, the strategic roadway junction, Vuhledar is often called a &quot;fortress&quot; among the military. The town is now at the epicenter of a Russian months-long push. The loss of Vuhledar would pose a threat to the southern flank of Pokrovsk, another city Ukraine is struggling to hold amid continuous Russian assaults. In recent days, Russian troops appear to have dramatically stepped up the assault, and information from Russian pro-war military bloggers and open-source monitors suggests Ukrainian forces are at risk of Russian encirclement. &quot;Russian units have entered Vuhledar &#x2013; the storming of the town has begun,&quot; the &#xA0;Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger Yuri Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 23. In a Sept. 24 update, the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState said Russian forces were &quot;simply razing it to the ground&quot; with artillery and guided bombs. A video accompanying the post purportedly showed multiple explosions in an unidentified part of the town. The latest map from DeepState shows Russian forces attacking the town directly as well as on both of its flanks. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, in its morning update on Sept. 24, said there were &quot;eight attempts to seize our positions&quot; in the area but did not provide any further details. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine&apos;s military for information on the situation in Vuhledar, but it declined to respond. &quot;I would be surprised if the battle goes on for much longer,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think we are seeing the end times of Vuhledar as we speak.&quot; According to Ukrainian government statistics, Vuhledar was home to 14,000 people on the eve of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. By February 2024, around 100 people were left in Vuhledar, mostly pensioners living in basements. The city is now practically depopulated and destroyed. Despite that, the loss of Vuhledar, a town that has resisted Russian occupation for years, would be a serious blow to Ukrainian morale. &quot;Potentially (its loss could) threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier in September. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Borsari said. Given the Russian significant advance towards Pokrovsk from the east in recent weeks, Ukrainian forces need to avoid a similar development from the south to avoid the risk of encirclement, Borsari added. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls.

(Libkos/Getty Images)Russia has long said that its goal is to occupy Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, and Vuhledar was one of the towns that had long been standing in the way of this, Dmytro Zhmaylo, co-founder and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. &quot;Ideological requirements, as well as information and psychological ones, often dictate military objectives for the Russians,&quot; Zhmaylo said. Vuhledar and its surroundings are heavily urbanized and lie on higher ground, making the territory a challenge to seize. Russia has suffered high losses in its attempt to take the town since the start of the full-scale invasion. Hundreds of troops from Russia&apos;s 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade, an elite naval infantry unit, were reportedly killed in their attempts to take the town in January and February 2023. Almost all Russian soldiers in the 5,000-strong brigade were killed, injured, or captured, the Ukrainian military said. As battles continued into March, the New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces destroyed at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers near Vuhledar. Ukrainian officials said this was the &quot;biggest tank battle of the war so far and a stinging setback for the Russians.&quot; In June 2024, Russian troops attempted to launch an assault on Vuhledar using not just tanks and infantry fighting vehicles but also dirt bikes, presumably to maneuver quickly on difficult terrain. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade defended against the attack and claimed to have destroyed 16 tanks, 34 fighting vehicles, and 19 bikes.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)In early September, however, Russian troops made a number of advances not far from Vuhledar. Russian troops made gains near the settlements of Hirnyk and Ukrainsk, approaching Kurakhove from the north, and managed to occupy the village of Prechystivka, 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) southwest of Vuhledar. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Sept. 10 that its forces had captured the village of Vodiane, just 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) to the northeast of Vuhledar. As Russia&apos;s advance continued in the following days, Russian pro-war military bloggers alleged that Russian troops had captured a mine just west of Vodiane. Russian commanders appear to have learned from previous failed attempts to attack Vuhledar directly, Kastehelmi said. Instead of direct mechanized assaults, Russian troops are now attacking from the flanks, something that is &quot;basic military logic,&quot; Kastehelmi said. The most serious issue is whether the Ukrainian flanks can hold. &quot;Right now, the Russians are less than 5 kilometers away from the main supply road, so there&apos;s less than a 10-kilometer gap between the Russian spearheads,&quot; Kastehelmi added. &quot;It&apos;s not a huge deal if the Russians manage to occupy a few high-rise buildings, but if they are able to seriously form an encirclement from the flanks, then that&apos;s a real issue.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-the-fall-of-vuhledar-would-mean-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2024-09-24T12:53:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1767720267-1.jpg
Russia continues construction of naval base in occupied Abkhazia, Ukraine hints it will be legitimate target	Last October, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would strike Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet wherever it will be stationed &#x2014; implying that could also include occupied parts of Georgia, where Russia has kept a garrison and is rumored to be constructing a naval base. &quot;We will reach them everywhere,&quot; the president said back then. The remarks sent waves across Georgia, raising fears that the war could soon touch Georgia, which has gone a long way to distance itself from Ukraine and its fight. Since then, Russia only sped up the construction of the base, which has the potential to drag the small South Caucasian country into a wider conflict. As Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, which has traditionally been stationed in occupied Crimea, has been hammered by Ukrainian attacks and largely forced to withdraw, Russia has sought a safe harbor further from Ukrainian drones and missiles. Ochamchire, located over 700 kilometers southeast of the closest Ukrainian-controlled territory, has the potential to offer Moscow a new naval base largely out of reach from much of Ukraine&apos;s current long-range capabilities. Details about the Ochamchire base, located in Abkhazia and occupied by Russia and its proxy forces since the 1990s, have been scant. Much of the analysis about the port has stemmed from satellite imagery and often contradictory statements from Abkhaz officials. Nonetheless, the project &#x2014; if completed to its full potential &#x2014; could have significant implications for Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. Talks on the creation of a Russian naval base in Abkhazia date back long before the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modern day Abkhazia is internationally recognized as Georgian territory, but has been under the rule of Abkhaz and Russian proxy officials since the 1990s. The first Russian warships reportedly were deployed to Ochamchire in 2009, shortly after the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia and the subsequent cementing of the occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

(Andrei Smirnov / AFP via Getty Images)Russia officially claims that Abkhazia is an independent country, currently recognized by four other states Venezuela, Nicaragua, Syria, and Nauru. The occupied region shares a land border with Russia and is fully dependent politically and economically on Moscow. The plans to move part of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet to Abkhazia gathered steam in the fall of 2023. Abkhaz proxy leader Aslan Bzhania told the Russian media outlet Izvestiya in October 2023 that Abkhazia had &quot;signed an agreement (with Russia) and, in the near future, there will be a permanent base for the Russian Navy in the Ochamchire district.&quot; No specifics of the proposed plan nor a timeline were added. Soon after, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), claimed that construction on the port had begun, saying that &quot;Russians have carried out dredging work there&quot; and that &quot;they have reconstructed the port infrastructure in some parts in order to ensure the basing of warships there.&quot; Despite the alarming nature of the proposition, the port, as viewed from satellite imagery, is still small and does not have the deepwater capacity to serve as a significant naval base &#x2014; much less than the existing ports in Novorossiysk or in Sevastopol, occupied Crimea. Nonetheless, subsequent investigations by Bellingcat and other outlets earlier in 2024 indicate that the construction had &quot;accelerated.&quot; While satellite imagery does reveal works on the port and the construction of new infrastructure from the previous year &#x2014; such as new buildings and forest clearing &#x2014; the actual dredging required to establish a deepwater naval base was not immediately clear. Bellingcat acknowledged that &quot;information has been scarce about Russia&apos;s plans for the naval base in Ochamchire. While satellite images show that there is an expansion of the base underway, it remains unclear what the purpose of the new structures will be.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s claim that &quot;there is now no safe base and no completely reliable logistical route in Crimea and on the occupied parts of the Black Sea and Azov coast&quot; was viewed by some in Georgia that Ukrainian missiles and naval drones could soon be hitting Russian ships moored in sovereign, yet occupied, Georgian territory. The possibility only added fuel to the rhetoric from the governing Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party, members of which have regularly claimed that the West is trying to push Georgia into the war. The developments in Ochamchire come against the backdrop of Tbilisi&apos;s warming relations with Moscow and deteriorating ties with the West. Protesters rally against the controversial &quot;foreign influence&quot; bill in Tbilisi, Georgia on May 8, 2024. The country has been gripped by mass anti-government protests since April 9, after the ruling Georgian Dream party reintroduced the bill, which critics see as repressive. (Giorgi Arjevanidze/AFP via Getty Images)Under the ruling Georgian Dream party, Georgia has seen democratic backsliding, which has been accompanied by a growing push for rapprochement with Russia. Georgian Dream officials, such as former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, nonetheless reacted critically to the proposed plans at Ochamchire, calling it an &quot;illegal decision&quot; that was &quot;the result of (Russian) occupation.&quot; In response to Zelensky&apos;s statement, Abkhazian leader Bzhania accused Ukraine of trying to &quot;provoke a military situation in the Caucasus and unleash a new bloody war.&quot; But a larger dynamic is unfolding between Russia and Abkhazia, which Moscow has controlled and financially supported since 2008. Following a series of disagreements between Abkhazia and Russia, particularly the Abkhaz government&apos;s decision in the face of street protests to abandon a bill that would have legalized the sale of real estate to foreigners, relations between Sukhumi and Moscow have plunged to new lows. Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba said earlier in September that Russia had decided to suspend aid to Abkhazia in response to its unwillingness to implement pro-Russian legislation (such as the apartment bill), which Shamba called a &quot;serious blow&quot; to their bilateral ties. In an illustration of the often contradictory news about the port, Shamba said in August that there are &quot;no plans&quot; to establish a Russian naval base at Ochamchire, despite satellite imagery showing construction work and the occupied territory having no navy of its own.

(Contributor/Getty Images)At the same time, Abkhazia&apos;s financial dependency on Russia puts it in a difficult position. &quot;A lot will depend on the Abkhazian de facto government&apos;s continued ability to resist Moscow&apos;s overreaches &#x2013; something they&apos;ve done quite successfully over the past few years,&quot; said Maia Otarashvili, director of the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. &quot;The Ochamchire port clearly offers a financial opportunity to the insolvent Bzhania government,&quot; Otarashvili told the Kyiv Independent. Aside from the inconsistency coming from Abkhazia, the future of the Ochamchire base is also tied to political developments in Tbilisi. &quot;A lot will depend on the outcome of Georgia&apos;s October parliamentary election &#x2013; if Georgian Dream is reelected with full majority, (Georgian oligarch and de facto leader Bidzina) Ivanishvili&apos;s designs on (a) complete monopoly over Georgia and its pro-Russian path will only intensify,&quot; said Otarashvili.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-continues-construction-of-a-naval-base-in-occupied-abkhazia-ukraine-hinted-it-will-be-a-legitimate-target/	2024-09-24T11:54:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-19_49_55.png
Russian troops constantly storming Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, situation 'steadily tense,' Ukraine's military says	Russian forces are continuously storming the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, with the situation remaining &quot;steadily tense,&quot; an infantry commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, known as &quot;Oscar,&quot; told Suspilne on Sept. 24. While there are signs of stabilization near Pokrovsk, the focal point of Russia&#x2019;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult near Vuhledar. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian troops are constantly pushing toward Vuhledar, attempting to advance from different directions along the front line, according to the Ukrainian commander. &quot;As soon as (Russian forces) find an opportunity to advance, they start to deploy their attack units there,&quot; he added. Russia is using a variety of weapons in its assaults on Vuhledar, including guided aerial bombs, armored vehicles, cannon artillery, mortars, and first-person-view (FPV) drones, Oscar added. &quot;All types of troops and all means available are being deployed by the Russian army in this direction,&quot; he said. &quot;The enemy has &apos;disposable&apos; equipment. Every armored vehicle that approaches our positions is mostly burned, and there are assaults every day,&quot; he said. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. The small mining town of Vuhledar has lied close to the front line since 2014 and has been well-fortified in case of further Russian aggression. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become a key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-constantly-storming-vuhledar-in-donetsk-oblast-situation-steadily-tense-ukraines-military-says/	2024-09-24T11:26:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325206.jpg
From Ukraine to a galaxy far away: How Ukrainian AI-voice company Respeecher became the go-to for Hollywood	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Alex Serdiuk, CEO of Kyiv-based AI voice company Respeecher, knew the company was onto a winner when no one noticed that the voice of veteran Star Wars actor Mark Hamill had been altered to sound younger in Disney&#x2019;s hit show The Mandalorian. Respeecher used decades-old footage to clone a young Hamill&#x2019;s voice and make it sound like the now 72-year-old Hollywood star had just stepped into the studio to record his lines. While some criticized the CGI used to make Hamill&#x2019;s face youthful again, few were aware that his voice had been altered too. Disney only revealed the fact six months later. &#x201C;That was a huge confirmation that we are doing an amazing job. If you don&#x2019;t hear a synthetic (voice), it means Respeecher did our job right,&#x201D; Serdiuk told the Kyiv Independent on the rooftop of Respeecher&#x2019;s downtown Kyiv office. Serdiuk founded the company in 2018 alongside Dmytro Bielievtsov and Grant Reaber, a U.S. citizen, with $150,000 in investment and the idea to clone and alter voices. With Respeecher, Disney can feature the voices of actors who have passed away, such as James Earl Jones, or help laryngectomy patients by replicating their voice for an electro-larynx device, an electronic voice box. Investors have funneled $4 million into the company since 2018. Respeecher has become the go-to for Hollywood studios with over 300 clients including Sony, Netflix, and Warner Bros., and has more than 170 projects already under its belt. The team is spearheading the new AI voice market, raking in six Emmys, two Webbys, and a Clio Award for advertising and design. A team of Respeecher in an undated photo with a backdrop of space. (Personal archive / Getty Images)Despite making a name in such a short period, the company has battled a difficult two years. The mental turmoil of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion weighs heavy on the 30-person team, the majority of whom chose to remain in Ukraine, and operating costs have spiked by up to 10% due to expensive vital equipment like generators and Starlink satellite internet systems. Moreover, the Hollywood strikes last year, when actors and writers fought for better pay and job security in the face of AI, ground production to a halt. Respeecher lost nearly half its revenue, resulting in staff layoffs as the company grappled to stay afloat. Nevertheless, Serdiuk said the company still managed to grow by 40% last year from 2022 and predicts that the AI voice market, part of the broader digital likeness market, is on the precipice of huge growth as the technology enters the mainstream. &#x201C;The technology brings crazy disruption. You can now detach a human from their voice. You can speak perfect Ukrainian or Chinese,&#x201D; he noted. Sirdiuk said that regulation in the U.S. and Europe is catching up, protecting celebrities&#x2019; rights to their likeness and curbing the Wild West of the last few years. In turn, celebrities are becoming more comfortable with the technology, allowing bigger projects to take place, such as a virtual Kiss concert that Disney has invested $200 million into. Trust and ethics are important qualities for Respeecher, according to Sirdiuk, especially as some companies have used AI voice technology to replicate celebrities&apos; voices for pornography or to spread disinformation. Respeecher, Sirdiuk said, first gets the permission of celebrities or their estates to clone a voice and doesn&#x2019;t publicly release its tech to avoid misuse. The company has also turned down offers from politicians keen to use the technology to run hyper-personalized ads, preferring to keep the company out of politics. With rising concerns over AI voices, Respeecher partners with deep-fake detectors to help train their software to pick up on AI voice patterns. Building trust is important, Siriduk believes, and helps Respeecher stay ahead of its competitors. However, he mentions that venture capitalists may not always agree, preferring rapid growth over ethics. &#x201C;Trust and quality go together,&#x201D; he stressed. The voice technology market is already crowded, with companies like Google and Amazon developing their own software, but none are suitable for films as they are noticeably artificial, Serdiuk said. What separates Respeecher from other AI voice companies is its emphasis on the sound department, the largest part of the company, rather than just focusing on the technical aspect, according to Serdiuk. A screengrab of Respeecher software on the backdrop of space. (Respeecher / Getty Images)While the quality of technology can be quantified and optimized, the naturalness of sound is subjective and requires a fine ear and creativity. &#x201C;You have to optimize towards speaker identity; Whether it sounds like me or not, and whether it transfers all those details that make my voice special,&#x201D; Serdiuk said. He points to Ukraine&#x2019;s highly regarded film dubbing sector and rich musical history as a key reason for its talented sound engineer pool. Even in the Kyiv office, instruments are scattered about, ready for the occasional workplace jam session. While based in Kyiv, the company doesn&#x2019;t have many projects within the Ukrainian film market, although Siriduk believes this could change in the future with Ukraine gaining an international standing. However, they occasionally work pro-bono with journalists to mask the voices of victims of war crimes while keeping the emotions and inflections that voice morphers eradicate. Siriduk is proud that his team has remained in Ukraine, despite investors unhappy with Respeecher being located outside Hollywood. But they did not lose any clients at the start of the full-scale invasion and even managed to stick to deadlines while missiles rained down across the country. &#x201C;The credibility we got in the market by that time was sufficient enough for our big clients to believe that we can deliver and that we are still in the game,&#x201D; Siriduk said. &#x201C;Two and a half years have passed and we keep doing projects.&#x201D; Respeecher is a prime example of Ukrainian innovation, transforming global industries, from entertainment and beyond, with its cutting-edge AI voice technology.

Zelensky's 'victory plan' contains 'no surprises,' Bloomberg reports	Western officials do not see a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; which he is presenting this week in New York, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24, citing undisclosed sources. Kyiv has remained secretive about the plan&apos;s details, which Zelensky is set to discuss with U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military aid with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. In addition to a NATO invitation and a pledge for arms supplies, Bloomberg previously reported that the plan includes a clear pathway to European Union membership. One official described the plan as a &quot;wish list,&quot; while another source familiar with Zelensky&apos;s discussions with foreign leaders said it contained &quot;no surprises&quot; and was not a &quot;major game-changer,&quot; Bloomberg wrote. At least one ally suggested it may be time for &quot;a new round of outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin, either by Zelensky or other countries,&quot; the two officials told the media outlet. Zelensky reportedly unveiled the plan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly&#x2019;s annual session. One source noted that while allies are committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as necessary, Zelensky needs to clarify what peace might look like. World leaders gathered in New York on Sept. 23 for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to promote his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. Zelensky is expected to present the plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-officials-see-no-breakthrough-in-zelenskys-victory-plan-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-24T11:11:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Ukrainian Air Force retracts report of Belarusian aircraft violating airspace	The Ukrainian Air Force retracted an earlier statement that an aerial target violated Ukrainian airspace from Belarus on the afternoon of Sept. 24. The Air Force initially reported that a low-speed aerial target had crossed the border from Belarus near Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts at around 2:30 p.m. local time, heading south toward Kyiv Oblast. Non-state military monitoring groups, including Belarusian Hajun and Monitor, also reported that a &#xA0;Belarusian Yak-130 combat aircraft had entered Ukrainian airspace. The plane reportedly crossed the Ukraine-Belarus border at 2:28 p.m. local time near the village of Dyatlyk in Belarus&apos; Homel Oblast, which borders Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv, Kyiv, and Zhytomyr oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims made by the monitoring groups. Later in the day, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said the detected object was likely a radar jammer, a false target. Belarus, Moscow&apos;s closest ally, hosts Russian troops, missiles, and aircraft but is not directly involved in Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an Aug. 15 interview that a third of Belarus&apos; army had been moved to the Ukrainian border earlier this summer. Speaking to Russia&apos;s Rossiya TV channel, Lukashenko claimed the move was in response to a buildup of Ukrainian troops, which he said was triggered by a misinterpretation of Belarus&apos; preparations for its Independence Day celebrations on July 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-air-force-retracts-report-of-belarusian-aircraft-violating-airspace/	2024-09-24T10:34:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-678825081.jpg
Russia attacks Kharkiv's densely populated districts, killing 3, injuring 28	Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 24, killing at least three and injuring 28 people, local authorities reported. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported at around 3:30 p.m. local time. Kharkiv&apos;s four districts were under attack, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. Terekhov said that Russia used eight FAB-250 bombs in the attack, while Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that one of the strikes was carried out with a FAB-500 bomb. One of the high-rise buildings came under a direct Russian strike, according to Syniehubov. People are trapped under the rubble; emergency services are continuing search and rescue operations at the scene, Syniehubov added. Terekhov said that one of the buildings, which was damaged in the Kyivskyi district, had already been attacked in the beginning of the full-scale invasion. According to the mayor, it was almost repaired, insulated, and prepared for the heating season before Russian forces struck it again. Some 82 people lived in the section of the building that suffered the most severe damage, Terekhov said. &quot;We are now trying to contact all of them to find out if people are under the rubble,&quot; he added. One of the strikes also hit a food industry enterprise, Terekhov said at around 5:30 p.m. local time. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman. The majority of the injured are in moderate condition, with four people in serious condition. Three people are in surgery as of 6 p.m. local time, according to Syniehubov. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is currently attending the U.N. General Assembly&apos;s High-Level Week in New York, condemned the Russian attack on Kharkiv and called on allies to &quot;stop the terror.&quot; &quot;There is a lot of talk at the U.N. General Assembly about collective efforts for security and the future. But we just need to stop the terror. To have security. To have the future. We need Russia to stop this criminal and unprovoked aggression that violates all global rules,&quot; Zelensky said. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian attacks for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kharkivs-densely-populated-districts-killing-3-injuring-24/	2024-09-24T07:58:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-24-17_14_05.jpeg
Zelensky, Modi discuss strengthening cooperation in New York	President Volodymyr Zelensky has met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss strengthening cooperation between Kyiv and New Delhi on Sept. 24 in New York, President&apos;s Office reported. Zelensky arrived in New York two days earlier to attend the U.N. General Assembly&apos;s High-Level Week. Ukraine&apos;s president last met with Modi on Aug. 23 during the Indian official&apos;s historic visit to Kyiv. In New York, Zelensky and Modi discussed trade, economic and defense cooperation, India&apos;s involvement in Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction, and collaboration in educational, scientific, and cultural initiatives, according to the statement. The two also discussed strengthening cooperation on international platforms, including the U.N. and G20, as well as implementing Ukraine&apos;s peace formula and preparing for the second peace summit scheduled for November. &quot;We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India&apos;s support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability,&quot; Modi wrote on X. Zelensky also thanked the Indian prime minister for &quot;clear support&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The meeting between Zelensky and Modi in New York was the third over the last year. Ukraine and India approved four cooperation agreements in August during Modi&apos;s first visit to Ukraine. The parties did not disclose the details of the deals. Modi&apos;s trip to Ukraine came just weeks after a visit to Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv, killing two people and injuring more than 50. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-modi-discuss-strengthening-cooperation-in-new-york/	2024-09-24T07:12:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYMMcTSWgAAdrgc.jpeg
Ukraine regains control of Vovchansk aggregate plant, military intelligence says	Ukrainian forces recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 24. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation&quot; earlier in the day, the agency said in a statement, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by HUR special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it added. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took under control the territory of the aggregate plant after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors, though several reports of Russia preparing new attacks have emerged since then. Some observers believe that the offensive helped to stretch Ukrainian forces as Russia intensified its push in Donetsk Oblast, focusing on towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Chasiv Yar.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-regains-control-of-vovchansk/	2024-09-24T06:15:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-24-155839.png
Russia surveilling Ukrainian nuclear facilities with Chinese satellites for possible future strikes, Zelensky says	Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government. Zelensky &apos;s remarks come after warnings from Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants (NPP) and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-takes-photos-of-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-with-chinese-satellites-for-possible-attacks-zelensky-says/	2024-09-24T05:34:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Zelensky wants Democrats to win US presidential election, Trump claims	Donald Trump claimed in a speech on Sept. 23 that President Volodymyr Zelensky wants the Democrats to win the U.S. presidential election. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that if elected he would do things &quot;differently&quot; to the current administration. President Joe Biden, who has sat in the White House throughout the full-scale war and played a key role in building the pro-Kyiv coalition, positioned Washington as Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor. Early next year, Biden will pass over the keys for the White House either to Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or her Republican challenger, Trump. &quot;I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He wants them to win this election so badly, but I would do (it) differently &#x2014; I will work out peace.&quot; Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The ex-president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris. In response to Trump&apos;s Sept. 23 comments, Morgan Finkelstein in a campaign email called out Trump for not stating that he wants Ukraine to win the war. &quot;Vice President Harris understands that if America walks away from Ukraine, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe and our NATO allies,&quot; he said. Zelensky is currently in the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership.&#x200B;&#x200B; Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet with Zelensky, as the Ukrainian leader said he also wants to present the victory plan to him.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wants-democrats-to-win-us-presidential-election-trump-claims/	2024-09-24T05:15:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Around 60% of foreign parts in Russian weapons come via China, Ukraine says	Most of the foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield against Ukraine come from China, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on Sept. 24. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fueling the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. &quot;If you take all the usual types of weapons and count the foreign made components, about 60% would be coming from China,&quot; Vlasiuk said in comments reported by Reuters, calling Beijing &quot;the biggest problem.&quot; Vlasiuk said that Kyiv held talks with some manufacturers on the issue, without providing further details. Important parts used in surveillance systems, drones and missiles also come from countries inclusing the U.S., the Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland, he added. Despite extensive Western sanctions aimed at cutting off supply lines, Russia continues to obtain sanctioned goods, such as microchips, via third-party countries. Kyiv&apos;s allies have sought to halt the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent sanctions. One of the EU&apos;s sanctions package included a ban for third-country entities to re-export sensitive goods to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia uses dozens of critical components from abroad to produce all its missiles. Missiles launched at Kyiv in one of the spring attacks had an estimated total of 1,500 foreign parts.	https://kyivindependent.com/china/	2024-09-24T04:10:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240131265.jpg
Invitation to NATO part of Ukraine's victory plan, Yermak confirms	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. An invitation to join NATO is part of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said during a visit to the U.S. on Sept. 24. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to present the victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO is part of the victory plan,&quot; Yermak said in a post on Telegram. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 22, Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Yermak said that the five-point victory plan includes both diplomatic and military components. &quot;I also urged our partners to ignore Russia&apos;s threats of escalation,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-plan-includes-invitation-to-nato-yermak-confirms/	2024-09-24T02:44:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russia to maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reports	The Kremlin will maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24 citing draft budget proposals seen by the outlet. With no immediate end to the war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. NATO countries have set a goal to spend 2 percent of the country&#x2019;s GDP on defense in 2024. Russia is spending around 6 percent. Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that backed growth until now, it was reported on Aug. 9. Labor resources are practically drained while the competition between the military and business for recruits becomes more fierce. This is likely to limit the further growth of defense-related industries. The banking and construction sectors are no longer protected from the impacts of high interest rates as the government shuts down the state-subsidized mortgage programs. Despite Russia&apos;s GDP growing by 4% in the first quarter of the year, it will likely slow down to 2% in the last half of the year and hit 0.5% - 1.5% in 2025, says Alex Isakov, Russia economist at Bloomberg Economics.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-maintain-record-high-defense-spending-in-2025-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-24T02:34:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2149287288.jpg
Blocking Ukraine's EU accession over Volyn massacre in line with Putin's policy, Poland's Duda says	Threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy, Polish President Andrzej Duda said in an interview with Polsat News published on Sept 23. Duda&apos;s criticism was in response to recent remarks by Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, who said that Ukraine should not join the EU until the historical issue of the massacre of Poles in Volyn is resolved. The minister was referring to the 1943 massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the issue has come to the forefront of public discussion several times, namely during the tenure of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which was in power between 2015 and 2023. According to Duda, one of the reasons Putin attacked Ukraine was to prevent the country from joining the EU. &quot;If someone says in this regard that they are going to block Ukraine&apos;s access to the European Union, they are following Vladimir Putin&apos;s policy. I don&apos;t know if this is the intention of those who are now in power,&quot; Duda said. In summer 2023, Duda visited the town of Lutsk to commemorate with Zelensky the victims of the Volyn tragedy, which was seen as an important move amid the tensions between the two nations regarding the issue. &quot;It is also in Ukraine&apos;s interest to find an understanding with us on all complex issues, including historical ones,&quot; Duda said in the interview. Zelensky promised in 2019 to lift the Ukrainian moratorium on the exhumation of Volyn victims, imposed in reaction to cases of destruction of UPA memorials in Poland. The matter has not yet been resolved, however, and Polish President Andrzej Duda said in 2023 that obtaining permission for the exhumations plays a crucial role in Polish-Ukrainian relations. Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, estimates that the number of Polish victims of the massacre varies from 60,000 to 90,000. The number of Ukrainians killed by Poles in the 1940s is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000, including between 2,000 and 3,000 in Volyn, according to Polish historian Grzegorz Motyka. In 2016, Poland&apos;s parliament recognized the killings as a genocide, a term that Ukraine denies.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-opposes-intentions-to-block-ukraines-eu-accession-over-volyn-tragedy/	2024-09-24T02:00:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 39 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed four people and injured 39 over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 24. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 81 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirteen more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions, according to the statement. Russian forces also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, two Kh-59/69 cruise missiles and one missile of a type yet to be determined. A Russian overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed one person and injured at least seven others, including a 15-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The strike targeted a critical infrastructure facility and a residential neighborhood. A house was destroyed and more than 70 apartment buildings were damaged, Fedorov said. In Kharkiv Oblast, an attack on Kupiansk killed an 82-year-old woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Another woman, aged 59, suffered injuries after Russian forces attacked the village of Osynovo, the governor said. One person was killed in the town of Kramatorsk and another in the village of Udachne in the Pokrovsk district, Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A total of 18 people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, he added. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 23 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Thirteen people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-injure-39-over-past-day/	2024-09-24T00:53:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-24_09-30-49.jpg
Temporary' occupation of Ukrainian territory most likely outcome of Russia's full-scale invasion, Czech president says	The &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Czech President Petr Pavel said in an interview published on Sept. 23. Speaking to The New York Times (NYT), Pavel said neither Ukraine nor Russia should expect to achieve outright victory. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said. As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine. Pavel said that Ukraine &quot;will have to be realistic&quot; about the prospects of recapturing the Russian-occupied territories. &quot;The most probable outcome of the war will be that a part of Ukrainian territory will be under Russian occupation, temporarily,&quot; Pavel said, though he added this could last for years. Ukraine says peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Zelensky is also expected to present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to President Joe Biden during his ongoing visit to the U.S. this week. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-to-be-realistic/	2024-09-23T23:51:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995526.jpg
Putin is very much afraid' — Zelensky says Kursk incursion exposed Kremlin's weaknesses to Russian public	Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;very much afraid&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview to be aired on Sept. 24. Speaking to ABC News, Zelensky said the operation exposed serious weaknesses in the Kremlin&apos;s leadership and its ability to protect its people. &quot;It&apos;s true. He&apos;s afraid very much,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Why? Because his people saw that he can&apos;t defend... all his territory.&quot; Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024, but little action was taken. The Good Morning America interview with Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska comes as world leaders convene in New York City for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to champion his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. He is expected to present the victory plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In the interview, Zelensky said the plan aims to achieve the &quot;strengthening of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s why we&apos;re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It&apos;s very important,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I think that we are closer to peace than we think. &quot;We are closer to the end of the war. We just have to be very strong, very strong.&quot; On Sept. 23, Zelensky met with a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation on Sept. 23, including Senators Ben Cardin, Dan Sullivan, Chris Murphy, and Congressman Gregory Meeks, to express gratitude for their critical support of Ukraine. He updated them on Ukraine&apos;s current security situation and the challenges anticipated next year. Zelensky said that &quot;decisive action now can accelerate a just end to the war,&quot; adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan aims to bring peace.&quot; American leadership plays a crucial role in defending freedom worldwide,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, thanking Congress for its unwavering commitment.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-very-much-afraid-zelensky-says-kursk-incursion-exposed-kremlins-weaknesses/	2024-09-23T22:50:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg

This incident follows a similar attack on September 11, when two younger boys set fire to a Mi-8 helicopter at Noyabrsk airport in the Tyumen region. In addition to these attacks, various sabotage incidents, including train derailments, have occurred across regions of Russia.

Zelensky, Japanese PM Kishida meet in US, discuss energy sector	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the U.S. on Sept. 23 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy sector challenges, Zelensky reported via Telegram. World leaders convened in New York City on Sept. 23 for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to champion his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. Zelensky and Kishida discussed Japan&apos;s ongoing support for Ukraine, with particular focus on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector.

The leaders also discussed strategies to prevent Russia from evading international sanctions and mechanisms by which Ukraine can receive up to $50 billion in frozen Russian assets. Since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Japan has also supported Ukraine&apos;s energy sector, which has suffered billions in damage due to Russian attacks, and shared expertise on nuclear safety. Under a security agreement signed in June, Tokyo pledged to provide Ukraine with an additional $4.5 billion in 2024 and continue supporting the country throughout the next 10 years.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-japanese-pm-kishida-meet-in-us-discuss-energy-sector/	2024-09-23T15:57:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/kishida.jpeg
Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia kills 1, injures 5, including 13-year-old girl	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia the night of Sept. 23, killing one man and injuring five other civilians, including a 13-year-old girl, city authorities reported. The strike targeted a critical infrastructure facility and a residential neighborhood, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported via his official Telegram channel. The attack in the residential area killed one man and injured five others, among them a 13-year-old girl, City Council Secretary Regina Kharchenko said. Some of the victims were hospitalized. At least two houses were also destroyed, Fedorov said. The attack on the critical infrastructure facility caused a fire, but no casualties, Fedorov said. The fire has since been extinguished. Emergency workers are on site and the full extent of the damage is currently being investigated. Attacks against Zaporizhzhia the previous night injured 22 people, including two children. Monitoring groups reported that the night&apos;s attacks marked the first time a guided aerial bomb was used to target Zaporizhzhia. Fedorov warned residents on Sept. 23 at about 9:51 p.m. local time that there was threat of guided aerial bombs over the city. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-zaporizhzhia-kills-1-injures-5-including-13-year-old-girl/	2024-09-23T15:01:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/zap.jpg
Russia and its 'accomplices' want to disrupt global unity, Zelensky tells UN	Russia and its &quot;accomplices&quot; are actively trying to prevent global unity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the United Nations&apos; Summit of the Future on Sept. 23. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, ahead of the 79th U.N. General Assembly and a series of meetings with world leaders devoted to presenting Ukraine&apos;s &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Summit of the Future 2024, held at U.N. headquarters in New York City, covers a broad range of global themes, including peace and security. &quot;You all can see who always not only stands against (the U.N. charter), but also actively works to undermine global unity,&quot; Zelensky said in his address during the plenary session of the summit. &quot;The same small group of seven accomplices, led by Russia, has once again acted destructively, always opposing any global initiatives that strengthen the effectiveness of the U.N. charter.&quot; Zelensky did not list Russia&apos;s &quot;accomplices&quot; by name, but said this group has &quot;always behaved this way,&quot; seeking to undermine U.N. efforts and rule of law. Zelensky urged world leaders to join Ukraine&apos;s efforts &quot;to overcome the destructiveness of Russia and its accomplices,&quot; calling on nations to participate in the next global peace summit for Ukraine. &quot;Putin has stolen much already, but he will never steal the world&apos;s future,&quot; he said. Ukraine&apos;s goals for peace, including the president&apos;s much-anticipated victory plan, are the focus of Zelensky&apos;s U.S. tour. Zelensky is expected to present the details of the plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. The five-point plan reportedly includes Ukraine&apos;s fast-tracked accession to the NATO alliance. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-and-its-accomplices-want-to-disrupt-global-unity-zelensky-tells-un/	2024-09-23T14:26:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173251936.jpg
Biden-Zelensky talks: Ukrainian soldiers want firepower to win but question if US wants Russia defeated	As President Volodymyr Zelensky kicked off a visit to the U.S. this week in a bid to secure more firepower for his army, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground monitored the news with half-hearted hope, questioning whether Kyiv&#x2019;s top Western ally would provide enough to help them defeat Russia. In a historic trip more than two years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Zelensky is set to present what he describes as Ukraine&apos;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; to his American counterpart, Joe Biden. He hopes that if backed by the outgoing U.S. president, it will include the weaponry needed and the lifting of restrictions on deep strikes into Russia using Western missiles. &#xA0; The Ukrainian leader began the U.S. visit in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden&apos;s hometown, at an ammunition factory arming Ukraine&apos;s artillery units with shells. Zelensky is due to travel on to the UN General Assembly in New York and later Washington, D.C. Thousands of kilometers away on the hottest spots of the front line in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, multiple soldiers told the Kyiv Independent that they don&#x2019;t anticipate notable progress from Zelensky&#x2019;s efforts to win over Biden but agreed on the importance of pressing Western allies for permission to use their long-range weapons on Russian territory. The trip comes as Ukrainian forces hold on to a patch of Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast weeks after conducting a surprise incursion and as Russian troops carried on with a grinding advance in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast, primarily toward the logistic hub of Pokrovsk, the fall of which would loosen Kyiv&#x2019;s grip on its last controlled cities in the war-torn industrial region. &#x201C;I have no optimistic hopes for Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S.,&#x201D; said infantryman Artem with a battalion fighting in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, another hotspot along the more than 1,000-kilometer front line in Ukraine that lies south of Kursk Oblast and north of Donetsk Oblast.

(Patryk Jaracz/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;Maybe we will get a few more shells and missiles, and that&apos;s it,&#x201D; Artem said. &#x201C;In general, I have the impression that the U.S. does not really want us to defeat Russia. We won&apos;t lose, but we won&apos;t be able to win for a long time,&#x201D; Artem added. He quipped that it may be &#x201C;beneficial&#x201D; for the U.S. to exhaust and weaken Russia for several years rather than give Ukraine what it needs to win the war. He warned that this largely static war could continue for several more years as neither side would have the means to achieve a significant breakthrough on the battlefield. To compete against a foe with much more troops and heavy weaponry, Ukraine has so far relied on homemade drones to strike Russian military targets&#x2014;from ammo depots to airfields&#x2014;deep inside Russia. Hoping to boost the firepower and range of such strikes, Zelensky, with his visit, is set to be the latest European leader in the Western alliance backing Kyiv to nudge Washington into a major decision that would allow Ukrainian troops to aim at Russian targets using precise NATO military alliance missiles. Ukraine lacks sufficient manpower and resources to change the tide in the eastern Donbas battlefields, where Russian troops have been in a grinding offensive since October 2023 gradually gaining ground. However, Ukrainian soldiers emphasized that weakening Russia by striking targets in the rears would help Ukraine have a chance at a breakthrough in the war. &#x201C;If we strike at Russia&apos;s rear, then the enemy&apos;s logistics would be depleted, and fewer shells, missiles, equipment, and fuel would be sent to the front from their side,&#x201D; said infantryman Artem, defending the Kupiansk front. &#x201C;This would then affect the strength of Russian units on the contact line.&#x201D; &#x201C;And over time, we could turn this in our favor and launch counteroffensive operations,&#x201D; he added.

Though Kyiv&#x2019;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; has not been revealed yet, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said last week that Zelensky would soon publicly present the proposal that &#x201C;will strengthen Ukraine, Ukrainian warriors, and Ukrainian people.&#x201D; The plan should encompass the complete withdrawal of Moscow&#x2019;s troops from the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, which account for nearly 20% of state turf, and compensation for the damage they caused during the war, said infantryman Serhii with the 79th Separate Assault Brigade in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian soldiers stressed that they critically needed more ammunition shells, drones, air defense missiles, and even basic transport vehicles. Soldier Artem said that a ramped-up supply of first-person-view (FPV) drones would be critical, as it would help Ukraine compensate for its manpower disadvantage. As the situation on the eastern front line deteriorates daily, Zelensky is due to meet outgoing U.S. president Biden on Sept. 26 at the White House. Zelensky will also hold separate meetings with 2024 presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Biden&#x2019;s vice president and the Democratic party nominee, and hopes to meet Republican candidate Donald Trump, who seeks re-election. &#x201C;The President and Vice President (Harris) will emphasize their unshakeable commitment to stand with Ukraine until it prevails in this war,&#x201D; Biden&apos;s Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a Sept. 19 statement. Trump, in a recent debate with Harris, refused multiple times to confirm whether he sought Ukraine to defeat Russia in its invasion, insisting that under his watch, the war would never have occurred and that knowing both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, he could swiftly negotiate a settlement.

(Aaron Schwartz/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Zelensky&#x2019;s visit comes days after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Biden urging permission for Ukraine to conduct strikes deep into Russia using Western missiles, including the British-supplied Storm Shadows, which have U.S. components. The Kremlin warned that a decision to lift the restriction would make the West a participant in the conflict. Before departing for the U.S., Zelensky said at a press conference during European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Sept. 20 that he hoped for a quick decision from all Western allies to support his &#x201C;victory plan.&#x201D; He stressed the importance of the U.S. leadership role in providing Kyiv with the support it needs to win the war, which diplomats have told the Kyiv Independent recently has not been felt strongly. The permission to use Western weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia is &#x201C;an important component of future victory,&#x201D; said Oleh, a Ukrainian drone operator deployed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Oleh said that this is a war of technology, as it is impossible to compete against Russia with just the manpower in World War I-style trench warfare. &#x201C;For every one of ours, eight Russians must be killed to equalize the mobilization reserve,&#x201D; he added. Stressing that technology will ultimately give Ukraine the upper hand on the battlefield, Oleh said he was optimistic that Zelensky would return home with results. &#x201C;I hope that Zelensky will reach an agreement (with the U.S.), and we will be given more weapons and be allowed to use them as we need, not as they allow us (now),&#x201D; Oleh said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-zelensky-talks-ukrainian-soldiers-want-more-weaponry-but-question-if-us-wants-russia-defeated/	2024-09-23T13:37:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995299.jpg
Japan warns off Russian military plane, uses flares for first time	Japan scrambled fighter jets and used flares to warn off a Russian military plane that breached Japanese airspace on Sept. 23, Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara said. The airspace violation could be related to the joint military exercises Russia and China planned to participate in during September. A Russian Il-38 reconnaissance aircraft entered Japanese airspace over Rebun Island, off Japan&apos;s northern coast, Kihara told reporters. The plane breached Japan&apos;s airspace three times, for up to a minute in each instance, over the course of a five-hour flight in the region. In response, Japan scrambled F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, which used flares after the Russian plane ignored earlier warnings. The incident marks the first time Japanese aircraft used flares to warn off a Russian military plane. &quot;The airspace violation was extremely regrettable,&quot; Kihara said. He also said Japan has lodged a protest with Moscow via diplomatic channels. &quot;We will carry out our warning and surveillance operations as we pay close attention to their military activities,&quot; Kihara said. The Russian plane was not engaged in particularly dangerous activities at the time it entered Japanese airspace, he said. Earlier in September, Russian Il-38 and other military aircraft were detected and tracked in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in North America, though the planes stopped short of violating U.S. or Canadian airspace. In July 2024, the U.S. and Canada scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian and Chinese military planes in the ADIZ.	https://kyivindependent.com/japan-warns-off-russian-military-plane-uses-flares-for-first-time/	2024-09-23T13:32:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1066022208.jpg
Control of US House, Senate is up for grabs. What could down-ballot elections mean for Ukraine support?	The entire U.S. House and some members of the Senate are up for reelection in November &#x2014; including some of Ukraine&#x2019;s staunchest backers in Congress, which could have an impact on future support for Kyiv in its fight against Russia. All 435 members of the House will face re-election on Nov. 5. Voter turnout is expected to be higher than normal given the face-off between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, likely increasing turnout for all congressional district races. While Congressional races aren&#x2019;t typically the focus of international concern, this November&#x2019;s elections could alter the political makeup of key committees and districts that have been reliable in their support of Ukraine. In some races, incumbent Democrats could be unseated by Trump-backed Republicans who oppose America&#x2019;s support for Ukraine. Republicans are slightly favored to retain leadership in the House, according to Inside Elections, an independent political analysis organization, but Democrats are benefitting from momentum and a surge in down-ballot financing following the rallying around Kamala Harris. In some states, early in-person voting is already underway.

(Saul Loeb /AFP via Getty Images)Democrats are also facing what Rep. Jim Costa of California said are strong concerns about efforts from the Kremlin to benefit Trump in the election. &#x201C;The constant effort of Russia today, not just RT, but their various means to infiltrate our election process, to disrupt and favor Trump, is well known and substantial,&#x201D; Rep. Costa said, referencing the state-owned news outlet in Russia that recently had two employees indicted for funding a pro-Russian network in Tennessee. &#x201C;Russia is also trying to impact elections down ballot where they can.&#x201D; For House Republicans, who currently have the majority, 112 representatives who voted &#x2018;no&#x2019; on the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine that was passed in April are up for re-election. Among those are 12 Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Its chairman, on the other hand, Rep. Michael McCaul, is among the more supportive Republicans of Ukraine, having voted yes on the April aid package. House Democrats in support of Ukraine could gain another vote should Foreign Affairs Committee member and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, lose this November. Perry, who has voted against all significant Ukraine packages lately and is known for his connection to Donald Trump&#x2019;s 2020 election denial, is facing a challenger who has expressed support for Ukraine. &quot;If (Putin is) successful in Ukraine, how much further will he take it?,&quot; the challenger, Janelle Stelson, told a Pennsylvania television station in April. &quot;Will he then start eking into our NATO allies? We don&apos;t know what&apos;s in his mind. But when I see Scott Perry vote against Ukraine and vote for Russia, that&apos;s a real problem for me.&quot; Chair of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) speaks during a news conference with members of the House Freedom Caucus at the U.S. Capitol in in Washington, DC, U.S. on Nov.29, 2023.

(Joe Lamberti for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who visited Kyiv on Sept. 13 and serves on the Armed Services Committee, is one of the most adamant Ukraine-supporting conservatives who could lose in November. Rep. Bacon defeated an anti-Ukraine opponent from his right wing in the Republican primary and now must face a general election Democrat in a district won by President Biden in 2020. Nearly two-thirds of Americans support Ukraine in Rep. Bacon&#x2019;s estimates, which is why he said discussing his support of Ukraine is a winning issue in his divided district. In April, 44% of Americans said they were extremely concerned about the possibility of Ukraine being defeated and taken over by Russia. &#x201C;If I happen to lose in November it won&#x2019;t be because of Ukraine,&#x201D; Rep. Bacon told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I think I would be in a worse spot if I didn&#x2019;t support Ukraine.&#x201D; In Cleveland, Ohio, one of the largest Ukrainian communities in the country, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the Democratic co-chair of the bipartisan Ukraine Caucus, has faced growing support from the Republican opposition who&#x2019;ve challenged her in previous races. Kaptur, who recently led a bipartisan letter calling for the Biden administration to lift its restrictions on Kyiv&#x2019;s use of American weapons to strike inside Russia, won her last race by 13% but used to be re-elected more handily with a margin near 30%. Knowing that the economy is the number one driver on most voters&#x2019; minds, the reliable advocate for Ukraine hopes that the number of veterans in Ohio who know the realities of war abroad and aid workers who&#x2019;ve helped Ukrainians in Cleveland will show up on election day with foreign policy in mind.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;A lot of Ohioans have come to see &#x2014; they didn&#x2019;t even know where Ukraine was &#x2014; now they&#x2019;re seeing this creeping threat across NATO,&#x201D; Kaptur told the Kyiv Independent. The campaign for Republican Derek Merrin who is facing Kaptur did not respond to requests for comment. When it comes to adamantly vocal opposition to support of Ukraine, Congress&#x2019;s distinct Republicans are Marjorie Taylor Greene in the House and JD Vance in the Senate, Trump&#x2019;s running mate. Greene, the current two-term fringe Georgia representative blamed for spreading Russian propaganda, is among the incumbents that would make Ukraine lobbying easier should she lose in November. The campaign website of her opponent, Shawn Harris, says that America should use all the tools available to manage Russia&#x2019;s threat, including civilian and military aid. However, if Greene&#x2019;s 2022 re-election where she won handily with over 65% of the vote is any indicator, Harris&#x2019;s odds of overthrowing the conspiracy theorist won&#x2019;t be easy. Congress&#x2019;s only Ukraine-born representative, Indiana Republican Victoria Spartz, is one of the incumbent Republicans who voted no on aid to Ukraine in April and could be unseated by a Democrat in November. Deborah Pickett, the Democrat challenging Spartz, said she supports continued aid to Ukraine, according to local reporting in Indiana. Rep. Spartz defeated her Democratic challenger in 2022 by over 50,000 votes, but in 2020 defeated the Democratic opposition by about 17,000 votes. Spartz, who did not respond to requests for comment, was backed by Trump in her successful 2020 primary, representing a sect of the Republican party that many view as voting on policy packages depending on the former president&#x2019;s views. &#x201C;I actually think there&#x2019;s a lot of Republican support on the Hill for Ukraine and to stand up to Russia,&#x201D; a Senate aide who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But some of these folks are caught in the Trump vice of their own making.&#x201D; (L-R) J.D. Vance waits backstage as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) speaks during a campaign rally at The Trout Club in Newark, Ohio, U.S. on April 30, 2022. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)In the Senate, where Republicans only need to flip two seats to guarantee control of the chamber, Democrats are likely to see their narrow majority fall to at least a 50-50 split due to the retirement of independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The state&#x2019;s Republican Governor who is expected to win the Senate seat, Jim Justice, has supported previous American aid to Ukraine. However, one of Republican&#x2019;s best chances to win a Senate seat is in Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester&#x2019;s incumbency is threatened in a state fond of Trump. Tester&#x2019;s &#xA0;Republican challenger, Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, has called for an end to American involvement in Ukraine, saying the U.S. should focus on its economy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time for the United States to end our involvement in this war,&#x201D; Sheehy said in a July 2023 statement. &#x201C;We must now demand a settlement which ends the killing of innocent people and the unlimited supply of arms from the United States.&#x201D; In Ohio, which has become a reliably red state for Trump since 2016, Senate Republicans have another shot at unseating a Democrat with a Trump-backed Ukraine skeptic. Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has consistently endorsed U.S. aid to Ukraine, faces a well-financed Republican, Bernie Moreno, who told a local news station that the U.S. should not be funding &#x2018;another endless war.&#x2019; There are a number of Republican candidates up for re-election or vying to join the House who align with Trump and thus pose questionable policies for Ukraine, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who isn&#x2019;t up for re-election until 2029 but has increasingly been in the public eye after being shortlisted for Harris&#x2019;s running mater said. &#xA0; &#x201C;(At the) same time, I expect that the Democrats win back the House, so after January I think (Democrats) will be in a better position, which means Ukraine will be in a better position,&#x201D; Sen. Kelly said.	https://kyivindependent.com/control-for-the-u-s-house-and-senate-are-up-for-grabs-what-could-down-ballot-races-mean-for-ukraine/	2024-09-23T13:11:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1745431731.jpg
Scholz meets Zelensky, says Germany will not let Kyiv use its weapons on Russian soil	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Shortly before the meeting, Scholz reaffirmed Berlin&apos;s refusal to allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets within Russia. &quot;Germany will not lift any restrictions,&quot; Scholz said in response to queries from reporters regarding long-range strikes in Russia. &quot;This does not depend on my personal attitude. We will not do that, and we have good reasons for that.&quot; While the U.S. and U.K. face increasing pressure to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles in Russia, Germany still refuses to supply Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz said his position would not change even if the U.S. lifts restrictions, and said that Germany aims to &quot;focus on what really helps and what is needed&quot; in terms of supporting Ukraine. &#xA0; Following Scholz&apos;s remarks, Zelensky met with the German chancellor to discusseUkraine&apos;s roadmap to peace and plans for a second global peace summit. &quot;We talked about how to bring a just peace closer. The main thing is to maintain unity,&quot; Zelensky said. &#xA0; The next peace summit will be &quot;a real platform to guarantee the full restoration of security for Ukraine and the whole of Europe,&quot; he said. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, kicking off a nearly week-long visit focused on presenting the president&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. Zelensky and Biden will meet at the White House on Sept. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-meets-zelensky-says-germany-will-not-let-kyiv-use-its-weapons-on-russian-soil/	2024-09-23T12:44:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/scholz.jpg
Denmark contributes $19.5 million to restore Ukraine's energy system	The Danish government has allocated 130 million Danish kroner ($19.5 million) to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after Russia&apos;s mass attacks, according to the Sept. 23 Denmark Energy Ministry&apos;s statement. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Danish Energy Minister Lars Aagaard announced new financial assistance for Ukraine on Sept. 23 in New York during a meeting within the G7 working group on Ukraine&apos;s energy security, which also involved U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the statement read. Denmark&apos;s new contribution to support Ukraine&apos;s energy system is one of the largest ever made by the country. The funds will be used to implement emergency measures, as well as to purchase equipment and spare parts to restore the security of the energy supply, the ministry said. &quot;Russia is violating the rules of war with its massive attacks on Ukraine&apos;s electricity and heat supply system. As winter approaches, many Ukrainian homes will be left without heat and electricity,&quot; Aagaard said. &quot;In addition, ordinary workers in the energy sector, who are doing their jobs against all odds, are being targeted. We must do everything possible to make the Ukrainian energy system as strong as possible,&quot; he added. In April, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko and Aagaard signed a memorandum on cooperation in bioenergy. The same month, Denmark provided Ukraine with $5.8 million for energy infrastructure. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Danish companies have transferred energy equipment to Ukraine four times through the Danish Energy Agency. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Denmark has provided almost $9.5 billion to Ukraine, making it the second largest financial backer as a percentage of GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-contributes-19-5-million-to-restore-ukraines-energy-system/	2024-09-23T12:26:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1244704193.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine’s avant-garde legacy battles against persistent destruction	On a recent trip to Kyiv, I was fortunate enough to join a tour of the city led by Olena Zaretska, the granddaughter of the legendary Ukrainian artist and dissident Alla Horska. Horska was part of a generation of young writers, artists, and intellectuals who challenged the repressive cultural atmosphere of Soviet Ukraine in the 1960s and eventually paid a high price for their defiance. Some were banned from working, others imprisoned, and some &#x2013; like Horska &#x2013; murdered by the state. The Soviet Union&#x2019;s violent response to artistic defiance wasn&#x2019;t new in the 1960s. One of Horska&#x2019;s &#x201C;crimes&#x201D; had been to seek out traces of artists and writers purged in the 1930s. She, poet Vasyl Symonenko, and theater director Les Taniuk discovered a mass execution site at Bykivnia, on the outskirts of Kyiv. They knew they had found it when they saw children playing with a skull in the woods. The soil at Bykivnia contained the remains of avant-garde writers Mykhail Semenko and Mike Yohansen, influential artist Mykhailo Boychuk, and many others. Of the trio who made this gruesome discovery in the early 1960s, only Taniuk would survive. Symonenko was beaten to death in 1963, and Horska was murdered in 1970. Horska, Taniuk, and their dissident circle didn&#x2019;t restrict themselves to seeking traces of the dead. In Kyiv in the early 1960s, some leading artists of the 1920s were still alive, holed up in their apartments, all but forgotten. Zaretska&#x2019;s tour group stopped outside an unassuming 1950s housing block in central Kyiv &#x2013; this was the former home of Anatol Petrytskyi, a central figure in the Ukrainian avant-garde of the early 20th century. His work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1930 and later exhibited in the U.S. Most of his fellow artists, like his close collaborator, theatrical genius Les Kurbas, had been murdered, but Petrytskyi survived. He died in 1964, his post-war career a faint echo of his early success. However, in his final years, he was moved to find himself rediscovered by a new generation once again pushing artistic and political boundaries. &#x201C;He spoke with tears in his eyes,&#x201D; Zaretska told us, standing outside the hip coffee shop that now neighbors Petrytskyi&#x2019;s old home, &#x201C;about the hundreds of works of his that the authorities had simply destroyed.&#x201D; The conversations in Kyiv apartments of the early 1960s, between those repressed under Joseph Stalin and those soon to be beaten under Leonid Brezhnev, are part of a pattern in Ukrainian cultural life. Each generation salvages the works and memory of the previous one, while constantly fending off renewed attacks. This cycle continues today: a groundbreaking exhibition of Horska&#x2019;s work at Kyiv&#x2019;s Ukrainian House Arts Centre took place in early 2024, in defiance of constant Russian air raids. Not long before, stunning murals by Horska, recently rediscovered by contemporary art historians under newer layers of paint and plaster, were destroyed by Russian missile attacks in eastern Ukraine. Regional art museums across Ukraine have been hit by Russian bombs or, as in the case of Kherson, looted by occupying forces. Perhaps one of the most powerful acts of heritage preservation in the face of Russia&#x2019;s war is the exhibition &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm,&#x201D; which has toured Madrid, Vienna, and Cologne, and is now at London&#x2019;s Royal Academy of Arts. The exhibition features important works of modernist art produced in early 20th-century Ukraine, mostly from Ukrainian collections. In late 2022, they were evacuated in secret by train via Poland, under Russian bombardment. &#x201C;We loaded the trucks with the paintings and sent them on their way with a military convoy and state guarantees instead of insurance,&#x201D; curator Konstantin Akinsha told ArtNews. After narrowly avoiding Russian missiles and navigating border closures, &#x201C;by some miracle, the trucks arrived in Madrid on time for the exhibition.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska visit a retrospective exhibition of Ukrainian artis Alla Horska at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 2, 2024. (Presidency of Ukraine / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)The achievements of the team behind the exhibition (curators Akinsha, Katia Denysova, and Olena Kashuba-Volvach, National Art Museum of Ukraine director Yuliya Lytvynets, among others) were not only in preserving the physical works but also in reclaiming their story. After decades of being written out of art history, Ukraine&#x2019;s artistic heritage must be reimagined and reclaimed. The place of Ukrainian cities &#x2013; Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa &#x2013; in the history of European modernism needs to be fully established, and the complex identities of Ukraine&#x2019;s artists recovered. This is difficult, given the dominance of the &#x201C;Russian avant-garde&#x201D; label, which obscures the identities of many artists from the imperial borderlands. Kazymyr Malevych, perhaps the most famous figure in the exhibition and a native of Ukraine, was known to his Polish parents as Kazimierz Malewicz. He worked in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine and was deeply influenced by the Ukrainian context (he even sometimes referred to himself as Ukrainian). Another star of the exhibition, Alexandra Exter, was born in what is today Poland to a Belarusian-Greek family and spent time in Kyiv, Paris, Moscow, and St. Petersburg. &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm&#x201D; avoids the trap of nationalizing these artists; its subtitle is &#x201C;Modernism in Ukraine,&#x201D; not &#x201C;Ukrainian Modernism.&#x201D; Denysova notes that these artists worked with a &#x201C;twofold agenda&#x201D;: to assert Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural autonomy while also engaging with international artistic trends. The exhibition also highlights important, yet often neglected, cultural dialogues within Ukraine. The brief period of Ukrainian independence after 1917 was a time of cultural rebirth not only for Ukrainians but also for Ukraine&#x2019;s Jews. While Ukrainian artists founded the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Jews created the Kultur Lige, an artistic organization aiming to forge a new Jewish culture for the modern world. &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm&#x201D; emphasizes this connection between these movements by juxtaposing two large canvases: Anatol Petrytskyi&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Invalids&#x201D; (1924), depicting a family of disabled beggars, and Manuil Shekhtman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Jewish Pogrom&#x201D; (1926), portraying a Jewish family recovering from one of the many anti-Jewish pogroms in Ukraine. The striking similarity in the bold scale, powerful figurative work, and deep empathy of the pieces reflects their shared roots. Petrytskyi and Shekhtman studied together at the Kyiv Art School in the 1910s; their teachers there later helped found the Ukrainian Academy of Art. The influence of one of those teachers, Mykhailo Boichuk, who famously synthesized Ukrainian Byzantine iconography with modernist aesthetics, can be seen clearly in the stylized figures of Shekhtmen&#x2019;s grieving pogrom victims. Neither the Ukrainian Academy of Arts nor the Kultur Lige lasted long; both were absorbed into Soviet institutions within a few years of the Bolshevik takeover of Ukraine, and both modernist projects were annihilated by Stalin&#x2019;s purges. In the 1930s, hundreds of writers, theater directors, and artists were labeled bourgeois nationalists and executed. Many more were imprisoned, and their manuscripts, books, and artworks destroyed.

The portrait was part of a series of one hundred images that Petrytskyi made of leading figures of the Ukrainian avant-garde movement. The fate of this series is a microcosm of the tragedy of cultural life in early 20th century Ukraine: only nineteen of the original one hundred survived. It is difficult to maintain artistic institutions in regions under the control of aggressive empires, but Ukraine&#x2019;s artistic legacy has repeatedly fought back and thrived despite every colonial assault by Russia. This multi-generational salvage operation ensures that art lovers worldwide can appreciate Ukrainian modernism. Yet the story of survival is inseparable from the story of destruction. The joy of seeing Petrytskyi&#x2019;s work in London is tempered by the knowledge that many of his works were lost forever. Similarly, the thrill of seeing Horska exhibited in Kyiv is overshadowed by the destruction of her murals in Donetsk by Russian shelling. Ukraine&#x2019;s lost avant-garde artworks could fill an exhibition space far larger than the one at the Royal Academy. The storm, clearly, is not over.

Ukraine war latest: Kyiv hits over 200 military targets in Russia using drones within a year	Key developments on Sept. 23: Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in an opinion piece for Forbes Ukraine published on Sept. 23. &quot;Today, Ukrainian drones fly over 1,000 kilometers (623 miles), reaching Murmansk and the Volga region, destroying Russian oil refineries and airfields,&quot; Umerov wrote. Among the targets of Ukrainian forces were control centers, airfields, ships, air defense systems, and Russian military bases, the minister added. According to the minister, Ukraine has increased its long-range military capabilities &quot;several times&quot; this year. Particularly, in 2024, the Defense Ministry contracted drones worth over Hr 21 billion ($507.6 million) in total and ammunition for drones worth Hr 9 billion ($217.5 million). Recent Ukrainian drone attacks have forced Russia to relocate its aircraft to airfields 250 kilometers (156 miles) from the Ukrainian-Russian border, Umerov said. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In recent months, Ukraine has increased the number of large-scale attacks on Russian territory. Ukraine has used over 100 drones in a number of its recent strikes against Russia. On Sept. 18, Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine&apos;s attack on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions, according to the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center. The next few months will be &quot;decisive&quot; in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 23, as he begins his nearly week-long trip to the U.S. Speaking at the American Academy of Achievement award ceremony in Washington D.C., Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to act faster and &quot;define what the outcome (of the war) will be.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t have much time,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The next few months will be decisive. Ahead of us in this war &#x2014; Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and all of you because this is Russia&apos;s war against freedom itself &#x2014; we are short of time to define what the outcome will be. &quot;And we must define it. Not Russia, not their bloody allies. We need to be faster. We need not to lose the next few months in war, so that we don&apos;t lose the next decades.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks came as he began his trip to the U.S. where he will present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to U.S. President Joe Biden, as well as to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. He will also attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York and meet other world leaders. Zelensky will present his &quot;victory plan&quot; as Ukraine holds territories in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, though Moscow keeps on pushing on multiple fronts in the country&apos;s east. Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from Washington to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Zelensky said the plan was designed to end the war with the backing of international partners without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation. However, he did not specify how it would achieve this. &quot;This must be our shared achievement &#x2014; victory for freedom, with no compromises at freedom&apos;s expense,&quot; the president said. At the American Academy of Achievement award ceremony, Zelensky received the Golden Plate Award in recognition of contributions to human development. Ukraine&apos;s 95th Separate Polissia Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 23 it had broken through another section of the Russian border. The brigade published a video purporting to show the breakthrough of engineering barriers, the crossing of airborne assault units into Russia, and the first battles near the border. The exact location and time of the attack were not disclosed, but the brigade said it was &quot;the second successful operation to break through the Russian border since the beginning of the operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.&quot; Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Over past weeks, Russia launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, which was halted on Sept. 18, according to the Ukrainian military. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine, primarily from the Pokrovsk sector. Moscow has moved about 40,000 Russian soldiers to Kursk Oblast as of Sept. 19, Zelensky said. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in an interview with the Delfi media outlet published on Sept. 23. In June, the Netherlands announced that it would provide radar and launch components, and that it had found another unnamed country to provide the additional necessary parts to make up a complete system. But earlier this month it was reported the unnamed country had backed out of the agreement. In the interview with Delfi, Brekelmans said the Netherlands was &quot;trying to find other elements that are necessary to complete the system.&quot; &quot;And there are several countries that are also very eager to help Ukraine,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They are doing everything they can. But they have encountered some problems that make it impossible to assemble this system.&quot; Brekelmans confirmed that the Netherlands provided Kyiv with a radar system and that three launchers would be delivered &quot;very soon.&quot; Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each. Romania will transfer a Patriot to Ukraine too after the donation was finally approved in early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-next-few-months-will-be-decisive-in-russias-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2024-09-23T11:27:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-19_35_24.png
