Putin must not win in Ukraine, Russian dissident Kara-Murza says	Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;must not be allowed&quot; to win the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian opposition figure and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza said during a press conference at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London on Sept. 20. Kara-Murza was released from a Russian penal colony on Aug. 1 as part of a historic prisoner exchange between the West and Russia. He had been sentenced to 25 years in prison in April 2023 for condemning Russia&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine. &quot;Vladimir Putin must not be allowed to win this war in Ukraine,&quot; Kara-Murza said at the press conference, organized jointly by RUSI and the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. &quot;More than that, he must not be allowed to have a face-saving exit from this war.&quot; Kara-Murza reportedly also met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Sept. 20 to urge Western governments to provide stronger support for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &#xA0; During the RUSI press conference, Kara-Murza went on to say that Western nations should prepare for the Russian Federation to transition to a democratic government after Putin eventually leaves office. &quot;None of us knows exactly when, exactly in what circumstances, but it&apos;s going to happen in the very foreseeable future. And next time, we must get this right.&quot; Putin holds a high approval rating among the Russian population (over 80%, according to independent polls), though those numbers have fallen some as the full-scale war drags on. Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast has also reportedly increased social discontent in Russia. A September 2024 poll found that nearly half of Russians may support the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, even if the Kremlin&apos;s military goals are not achieved. Kara-Murza also advocated for the release of more Russian political prisoners. &quot;I wake up every morning and I go to sleep every night thinking about all the others who are still left behind,&quot; he said. A dual Russian-British citizen, Kara-Murza was charged with &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;spreading false information,&quot; among other crimes, after being arrested in April 2022. While imprisoned, Kara-Murza won the Pulitzer Prize in May 2024 for the commentary he wrote from his prison cell. Kara-Murza was released in a historic swap along with fellow Russian dissident Ilya Yashin, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, and Russian-American journalist Alsa Kurmashova.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-must-not-win-in-ukraine-russian-dissident-kara-murza-says/	2024-09-21T16:07:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172311941.jpg
Russian strike on apartment building in Kharkiv injures at least 12	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces targeted a multi-story apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 21, wounding at least 12 people, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. The injured include one 8-year-old child and two teenagers aged 17, local authorities said. Sixty people have been evacuated from the high-rise. Terekhov reported via his official Telegram channel that the attack involved a guided bomb and that rescue efforts were ongoing at the scene. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov confirmed two separate strikes had hit the city. At least four cars caught fire following the strike and 20 more were damaged. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian assault for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-apartment-building-in-kharkiv-injures-at-least-12/	2024-09-21T14:18:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693-1.jpg
Russia says it will not take part in follow-up peace summit	Russia has announced it will not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit held in June, labeling the process a &quot;fraud,&quot; Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Sept. 21. Moscow was not invited to the June summit attended by over 90 countries, dismissed the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, has expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Zakharova criticized the summit on Telegram, saying: &quot;This process itself has nothing to do with a settlement. It is another manifestation of fraud by the Anglo-Saxons and their Ukrainian puppets.&quot; She emphasized that Russia is open to considering &quot;truly serious proposals&quot; that acknowledge the &quot;situation on the ground,&quot; a vague reference to Russia&#x2019;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, none of which it fully controls. Zakharova accused Ukraine and its Western allies of having no interest in pursuing peace, referencing Ukraine&apos;s recent incursion into Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region and Zelensky&apos;s continued requests for long-range Western weapons. She said that Ukraine and its Western backers &quot;were not thinking about peace.&quot; Ahead of the June summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts that Moscow now claims. Russia has since said it won&apos;t engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in the Kursk region. Zelensky has a plan on how to end Russia&#x2019;s war with Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. Kyiv remains tight-lipped about the specifics of the plan as Zelensky readies to present it to U.S. President Joe Biden and American presidential candidates during his upcoming visit. The plan is expected to cover military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-says-it-will-not-take-part-in-follow-up-peace-summit/	2024-09-21T12:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166613503-1.jpg
Russian attack on Nikopol kills 2, injures 2	Russian drone attack on the city of Nikopol killed two civilians, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured two others, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The drone reportedly hit a car, according to the governor. Two injured passengers included a four-year-old girl and a 25-year-old man. They have been transferred to the local hospital. The governor did not provide any further details. The city of Nikopol is the fourth-most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, home to over 115,000 people. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war. On Sept. 21., a Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed three people and injured three others, local authorities reported the morning. &#xA0;The attack destroyed two homes and damaged over two dozen others. It also damaged a school, garages, and cars. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-nikopol-kills-2-injures-2-2/	2024-09-21T11:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-21-13_22_52.jpeg
Zelensky's 'victory plan' includes invitation to NATO, commitment to sustained weapons supply, Bloomberg reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; includes an official invitation to join NATO and commitment to a sustained supply of advanced weapons, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 21, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. Kyiv remain secretive about the contents of the plan, which Zelensky plans to discuss with U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit to the U.S. next week. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points and focuses on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military assistance with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. Apart from the NATO invitation and the arms supplies pledge, Bloomberg sources said that the &quot;victory plan&quot; includes a clear pathway to European Union membership. Zelensky is expected to present the &quot;victory plan&quot; to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from the U.S. to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; After that, Zelensky promises to make the &quot;victory plan&quot; public. Zelensky has said that the plan is designed to end the war with the backing of international partners, without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation, though he did not specify how it would achieve this.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-victory-plan-includes-invitation-to-nato-commitment-to-sustained-weapons-supply-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-21T07:59:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1526771823.jpg
Russia preparing strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of winter, Foreign Minister says	Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of winter, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21, citing Kyiv&apos;s intelligence data. The possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations, &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system,&quot; according to Sybiha. &quot;Damage to these facilities would create a high risk of a nuclear incident that will have global consequences,&quot; Sybiha said in a statement published on social media. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the possible threat. &quot;Russia is the only country that seized a nuclear power plant in Europe, blackmailing the world,&quot; added the minister. &quot;The Ukrainian peace formula contains a clause on ensuring radiation and nuclear safety. We call on all international organizations and states that respect the U.N. Charter to prevent the scenario of the terrorist country.&quot; The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Its position near the front line has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. In his Sept. 21 statement, Sybiha thanked the IAEA for agreeing to expand its missions at several energy facilities in Ukraine and called on the agency to implement the decision as quickly as possible. The Ukrainian power grid has been heavily damaged during Russian aerial attacks, and it remains unclear how much of the infrastructure can be repaired before the temperatures drop. Energy deficits necessitated rolling blackouts during the summer and autumn, with some officials warning that Ukrainians may have electricity for 6-7 hours per day in the upcoming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-strikes-against-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-ahead-of-winter-foreign-minister-says/	2024-09-21T06:51:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg
Former Wagner base in Russia's Krasnodar Krai reportedly on fire	A fire broke out at the Wagner Group&apos;s former military base in Molkino in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Sept. 21, Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported, citing Wagner-linked Telegram channel. The Molkino camp hosted Wagner mercenaries for almost 10 years and was the group&apos;s main base in Russia. In the summer of 2023, the base was reportedly handed over to the African Corps, a unit consisting of former Wagner fighters subordinate to the Russian Defense Ministry. The African Corps operates in Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Niger, according to Meduza. The Wagner Orchestra Telegram channel published on Sept. 21 videos allegedly showing the base&apos;s administrative buildings and the headquarters on fire. It is unclear what caused the fire. The African Corps has not commented on the fire. The Wagner Group played a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading Moscow&apos;s assault in the Battle of Bakhmut in the spring of 2023. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the then-leader of Wagner, died in a mysterious plane crash in Russia on Aug. 23, 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led Wagner troops in a short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin. Following Prigozhin&apos;s mutiny and death, the mercenary group withdrew from Ukraine and became fragmented, operating in Belarus and some African nations friendly to Russia. Wagner units were reportedly incorporated into official Russian military structures, such as Rosgvardia. Since the death of Prigozhin, the Wagner Group&apos;s fighting force has significantly decreased, according to the U.K. Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/former-wagner-base-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-reportedly-on-fire/	2024-09-21T04:48:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1623017480.jpg
Japanese PM Kishida to meet Zelensky in US, media report	Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida departed on Sept. 21 for his four-day tour in the U.S., where he will reportedly meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Kishida is expected to convey Japan&apos;s intention to continue supporting Kyiv and imposing sanctions against Russia during the meeting. Zelensky is soon heading to the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership. Ukraine&#x2019;s Presidential Office has not announced the meeting with Kishida yet. This will be Kishida&#x2019;s final work trip to the U.S. before stepping down as the Japanese prime minister. He&#x2019;s also expected to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and attend the U.N. General Assembly, among other events. Since March 2022, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Under a security agreement signed in June, Tokyo pledged to provide Ukraine with an additional $4.5 billion in 2024 and continue supporting the country throughout the next 10 years.	https://kyivindependent.com/japanese-pm-kishida-to-meet-zelensky-in-us-media-report/	2024-09-21T04:04:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1257171526.jpg
Zelensky signs law to increase state budget by $12 billion for defense expenditures	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law on Sept. 20 to increase the state budget by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) to spend on defense and military needs. The law aims to finance &quot;urgent measures in the field of security and defense to counter the large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,&quot; according to an explanatory note on the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s website. Roksolana Pidlasa, the head of the Budget Committee, said that the additional $12 billion would mostly be financed through the issuing of domestic government bonds and reducing expenses relating to repaying the state debt. Another Hr 30 billion ($722 million) will come from revenues from tax increases, and Hr 12.7 billion ($306 million) will come from an increase in the excise duty on tobacco and fuel. The law was approved by Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on Sept. 18. MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak said afterward that this year&apos;s expenditures amounted to a record Hr 3.73 trillion ($89.8 billion). The draft state budget for 2025 foresees Ukraine&apos;s defense spending of Hr 2.2 trillion, which constitutes 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP), according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine&apos;s parliament approved on Sept. 17 a bill that proposes a tax increase of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-to-increase-state-budget-by-12-billion-for-defense-expenditures/	2024-09-21T02:46:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170184779.jpg

Drone strike causes explosions at facility in Krasnodar Krai, Russian officials say	A drone strike in the Tikhoretsk district of Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai caused detonations of &quot;explosive objects&quot; at an unspecified facility, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev reported on Sept. 21. The Tikhoretsk district houses a major ammunition depot that has expanded over the last year to accommodate munitions shipments from North Korea, according to the Washington Post. Russian air defense units intercepted two drones over the Tikhoretsk district on Sept. 21, Kondratyev said. &quot;The falling debris of one of them caused a fire that spread to explosive objects. A detonation began,&quot; he said. Local residents are being evacuated from the area near the blast, Kondratyev said. No casualties have been reported. While Kondratyev did not specify where the explosions occurred, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported that the Tikhoretsk ammunition depot was hit in the attack. The report comes mere days after Ukraine successfully launched an overnight attack on against one of Russia&apos;s largest arsenals on Sept. 18. Ukrainian drones targeted a weapons depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, built to withstand a nuclear explosion.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-causes-explosions-at-facility-in-krasnodar-krai-russian-officials-say/	2024-09-20T20:59:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165561187.jpg
US may send Ukraine medium-range missiles for F-16s, Politico reports	The United States may send Ukraine medium-range missiles for F-16 fighter jets as part of its latest military aid package, Politico reported on Sept. 20, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The U.S. is expected to announce a $375 million military assistance package for Kyiv next week, Reuters reported earlier on Sept. 20. The package represents the largest tranche of U.S. military aid for Ukraine since May 2024. A medium-range glide bomb known as the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) might be included in the new package, officials told Politico. The missile can cover a distance of over 70 miles. The contents of the package have not been finalized and are subject to change, the officials said. Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. would likely send patrol boats, ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, and spare parts as part of the latest round of military assistance. The JSOW has a shorter range than U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), long-range missiles that can travel up to 300 kilometers (190 miles). Ukraine has urged Washington to grant permission for Ukrainian troops to use ATACMS to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. While JSOW missiles won&apos;t accomplish that goal, the 70-mile range would allow F-16 pilots to keep their distance from the front lines and Russian air defense systems. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July and has already deployed F-16s to intercept Russian mass aerial attacks. One aircraft crashed during such a mission, marking Ukraine&apos;s first F-16 loss.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-may-send-ukraine-medium-range-missiles-for-f-16s-politico-reports/	2024-09-20T20:22:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218520.jpg
Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih kills at least 3, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed at least three people and injured three others, Oleksandr Vilkul, the city&apos;s military administration head, reported the morning of Sept. 21. A child was killed in the attack, regional Governor Serhii Lysak said. Another victim was an elderly woman who died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, Vilkul reported.

49% of Russians support withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, poll says	Nearly 50% of Russian people support withdrawing troops from Ukraine and negotiating for peace, even without achieving the Kremlin&apos;s military objectives, according to a joint survey conducted by independent pollsters ExtremeScan and Chronicles. The figures represent a striking shift from the overwhelming support for the war indicated by past polls. A February survey from the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, found that 77% of Russians supported the full-scale war in Ukraine. According to polls conducted by ExtremeScan and Chronicles in September 2024, 49% of Russians support the immediate withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and peace talks with Kyiv, an increase of nearly 10% from the three previous polls held since February 2023. When asked about Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, respondents said it was more important to oust Ukrainian troops from Russian territory than to seize more ground in eastern Ukraine. A majority of those surveyed (53%) said they supported removing Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast while only 15% said Russia should occupy more territory in Ukraine. The pollsters also probed the extent to which Russians were willing to support the full-scale invasion. According to the results, 32% are prepared to participate in the war if ordered by the Russian Defense Ministry, while 29% said they are not prepared to fight. Another 29% said they would support a new wave of Russian mobilization. The results are based on responses from 800 interviewees over the age of 18. The poll was timed to coincide with the two-year anniversary of the start of Russia&apos;s mobilization campaign. Both Chronicles and ExtremeScan began as startups in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The research projects were initiated by Russian antiwar activists looking to undermine the Kremlin&apos;s claims of broad popular support through innovative polling tactics. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult in a dictatorship, during a war, to get what people are really thinking because they tend to identify themselves with the majority, they tend to lie because they are afraid,&quot; Alexei Minyaylo, founder of Chronicles, told the Moscow Times in October 2022. Polls conducted by Chronicles and ExtremeScan have shown significantly less popular support for the war in Ukraine than those of other major independent polling centers.	https://kyivindependent.com/49-of-russians-support-withdrawal-of-troops-from-ukraine-poll-says/	2024-09-20T18:31:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165579283.jpg
Russia strikes Kharkiv with guided bombs, injuring at least 15	Russia attacked Kharkiv with guided bombs on the evening of Sept. 20, wounding at least 15 people, said Mayor Ihor Terekhov.

US Green Party candidate Stein calls Putin 'war criminal,' clarifying stance after controversial interview	U.S. presidential candidate Jill Stein from the left-wing Green Party released a statement on Sept. 19 condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Stein&apos;s statement said the campaign wanted to &quot;clarify (its) stance on key issues, particularly regarding any misunderstandings regarding...recent comments about Vladimir Putin and (Syrian leader) Bashar al-Assad.&quot; The Sept. 19 statement unequivocally called Putin a war criminal but cited Russia&apos;s &quot;military intervention in Syria,&quot; not the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as an &quot;example of his disregard for human rights.&quot; Stein reiterated previous calls for the need for &quot;diplomacy&quot; and said that &quot;the situation in Ukraine&quot; and other international crises &quot;have created a global environment reminiscent of the prelude to World War I.&quot; She did not call for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine but instead emphasized the &quot;necessity of engaging with adversaries like Putin to de-escalate tensions and work toward peaceful resolutions.&quot; Ajamu Baraka, Stein&apos;s running mate for the Green Party in 2016, hit back against the statement, saying that &quot;playing to the rightest forces among the left and (Democratic) Party was not necessary.&quot; The comments came days after Stein gave a widely criticized interview with U.K. broadcaster Mehdi Hasan, in which she declined to answer a direct question about whether Putin is a war criminal. &quot;So, what we said about Putin was that his invasion of Ukraine is criminal. It&apos;s a criminal and murderous war,&quot; Stein said in response. When Hasan pressed her, asking, &quot;And he&apos;s a war criminal who should be on trial?&quot; Stein said, &quot;well, by implication, by implication.&quot; Later on in the interview, Hasan again asked Stein the same question point blank &#x2014; &quot;Either you&apos;re a war criminal or you&apos;re not. Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?&quot; Stein again waffled, saying, &quot;In so many words, yes he is.&quot; But she added, &quot;If you want to pull him back, if you are a world leader, you don&apos;t begin your conversation by calling someone a war criminal.&quot; The Green Party candidate has been previously criticized for her views on Russia and its full-scale war on Ukraine, and has repeated Russian propaganda talking points, such as the false claims that NATO expansion provoked Putin and that the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution was a &quot;coup.&quot; Stein also attended a gala in Moscow in 2015, where she dined at a table with Putin and General Mike Flynn, who previously served as former President Donald Trump&apos;s national security advisor. Polls on the upcoming presidential election have consistently found that Stein is ranking under 2% among likely voters.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-green-party-candidate-stein-calls-putin-war-criminal-clarifying-stance-after-controversial-interview/	2024-09-20T14:48:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2149611594.jpg
‘Russia must feel it’s going to lose’ – Zelensky’s ‘victory plan,’ explained	More than 2.5 years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, as Moscow continued to make rapid advances in the east and launch relentless missile attacks across Ukraine, Kyiv seemed to be facing a stark choice: make territorial concessions for an unjust peace or prepare for a prolonged war, sacrificing more lives with no guarantee of success. Then, President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unexpected announcement &#x2013; he has a plan on how to end Russia&#x2019;s war with Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. The so-called &quot;victory plan&quot; was designed to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace. Kyiv remains secretive about the plan&apos;s details as Zelensky prepares to present it to U.S. President Joe Biden and American presidential candidates during his visit to the U.S. next week. The plan is expected to address military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies. A source close to Zelensky told the Kyiv Independent that the &quot;victory plan&quot; aims &quot;to create such conditions and such an atmosphere that Russia will no longer be able to ignore the peace formula and the peace summit.&quot; As Moscow has maintained initiative on the battlefield in the east of Ukraine for most of the year, it has repeatedly rejected Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which calls for a complete Russian troop withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, among other steps. &quot;The problem is, to get to that point where we have any sort of peace negotiations, Russia must feel like they&apos;re going to lose, and we are not there yet,&quot; Rep. Jimmy Panetta, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee in Congress, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I hope part of this victory plan is how we can shape battlefield conditions to reach that point,&quot; said Panetta, who met Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv last weekend. Zelensky announced his team was preparing the &quot;victory plan&quot; as Ukraine gained momentum following its incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, which has widely been considered a successful operation that exposed Russia&#x2019;s inability to defend its own territory and challenged its so-called &quot;red lines.&quot; Kyiv appears to be rushing to secure substantial backing behind its &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; from Washington ahead of the November election that might bring former President Donald Trump back to the White House and jeopardize the U.S. support for Ukraine. According to Zelensky, for the &quot;victory plan&quot; to work out, allies need to make &#x201C;quick decisions&#x201D; between October and December this year. In a few statements he has made about the &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; Zelensky mentioned it consists of four main points, with an additional fifth point to be implemented after hostilities end. The plan focuses on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense and creating the conditions to end the war. Zelensky told CNN that the plan covers issues such as security, Ukraine&apos;s geopolitical position, &quot;very strong&quot; defense aid, and economic assistance. In a Sept. 16 address, Zelensky said that curators had been assigned to each area, emphasizing that &quot;nothing is impossible&quot; in the plan. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office has not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for more details on the plan&apos;s contents. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi declined to elaborate but said that the plan &quot;will strengthen Ukraine, Ukrainian warriors, and Ukrainian people.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the U.S. Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US on Dec. 21, 2022. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)While Kyiv remains tight-lipped about the plan&apos;s specifics, Ukrainian officials have refuted media reports that it includes a partial ceasefire. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18. Danylo Lubkivskyi, the head of the Kyiv Security Forum, suggested that the victory plan would likely include ramping up sanctions against Russia and ensuring a safe sky over Ukraine, as well as the prospects of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership and international security guarantees &quot;These elements clearly need to be addressed,&quot; Lubkivskyi told the Kyiv Independent. One of the critical elements of the victory plan is likely the U.S. and other allies&apos; approval for Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target military sites deep inside Russia, a capability experts see as essential for Ukraine to have chances at defeating Moscow. Striking deep inside Russia will enable Ukraine to destroy the airfields from which Russian aircraft are taking off to attack Ukrainian civilian infrastructure as well as degrade Russian air defenses, thus allowing Ukrainian drones to hit key Russian oil and gas infrastructure, according to retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. Oil and gas sales are the key sources for financing Russia&apos;s war machine, with 10.7 trillion rubles ($115 billion) expected in revenue in 2024, up 21% compared to 2023. Long-range strikes will also allow Ukraine to destroy Russia&#x2019;s transportation infrastructure, military headquarters, artillery and rocket positions, airfields, and logistics, &quot;which will degrade Russia&apos;s only advantage &#x2014; mass (numbers),&quot; Hodges told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Without those capabilities, it doesn&apos;t matter how many unlucky, untrained Russian soldiers there are,&quot; he added. Although Western countries eased restrictions on the use of certain Western-provided weapons just across the border following Russia&apos;s May offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, limits on long-range strikes deep within Russia have remained in effect.

(Nikoletta Stoyanova/Getty Images)Hodges expects that during the upcoming U.S. trip, Zelensky will also continue to press for the rapid delivery of some long-promised equipment, munitions, and additional air defense capabilities needed to protect Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure ahead of winter. According to Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who also attended the meeting with Zelensky last weekend, one of the victory plan&apos;s priorities seems to be improving cooperation between Ukrainian oblasts and American states. This could mean developing &quot;more connections on the ground with the American public to garner more U.S. support of Ukraine,&quot; according to Panetta. Since November 2022, when various countries began promoting their strategies on how to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Kyiv has been advocating for its 10-point peace formula, which demands a full withdrawal of Russian forces and accountability for war crimes, among other things. However, this plan struggled to gain support among the nations of the so-called Global South such as Russia-friendly India and China. The introduction of the smaller &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; doesn&apos;t mean that Ukraine was forced to abandon any points of its peace formula and come up with a more modest strategy, according to Lubkivskyi. Instead, the &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; likely builds on it, specifying some of its most relevant aspects, the expert believes. Zelensky said that the &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; could pave the way to a lasting peace, achievable through the full implementation of the peace formula. Throughout the full-scale war, there have been reports of Western pressure on Kyiv to negotiate with Russia, which many Ukrainians fear could result in territorial concessions. These calls apparently intensified in the spring and summer of 2024 as Ukraine experienced a series of setbacks on the battlefield. However, in early August, Ukraine made a move that might have turned the tide of the war.

(Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)On Aug. 6, Kyiv launched a surprise incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast &#x2014; the first invasion of Russian territory by a foreign power since World War II &#x2014; causing talk of peace negotiations to fade. In just several weeks, Ukraine seized around 100 Russian settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles), according to Kyiv. Zelensky soon began speaking of his &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; saying that the Kursk operation is an integral part, though the exact role it plays remains undisclosed. &quot;The victory plan clearly takes advantage of the so far successful Kursk operation,&quot; William Taylor, vice president for Europe and Russia at the U.S. Institute of Peace and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There&apos;s a new momentum on the battlefield with the Ukrainians on the offensive and taking the initiative&#x2026; I think the actions on the battlefield reinforce the potential of the &#x2018;victory plan.&#x2019;&quot; The &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; also comes as the U.S. prepares for its presidential election, which could impact future aid to Ukraine. Ukraine is also reportedly planning a second global peace summit with Russia&apos;s potential participation ahead of the election in November. However, the &quot;victory plan&quot; had to be prepared regardless of the U.S. elections, according to Lubkivskyi. Ukrainians and Kyiv&apos;s foreign partners have been long expecting from Kyiv a clear strategy on how Ukraine sees the victory over Russia, Lubkivskyi said, calling the plan&apos;s creation &quot;a politically important step.&quot; &quot;The logic of constantly proposing new steps, offering tools (to ensure Ukraine&apos;s victory), must be followed regardless of political events in certain states,&quot; he added. &quot;The pressure must continue. This is the main guarantee of our success. And the bar must be kept high.&quot; Participants pose for a photograph during the Global Peace Summit at the Burgenstock resort, Switzerland, on June 15, 2024. (Michael Buholzer/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Will the plan work?Biden will be the first in the U.S. to see the full &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; next week. After that, Zelensky aims to present it to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. Zelensky explained that the plan is designed to end the war with the backing of international partners, without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation, though he did not specify how it would achieve this. &quot;The &#x2018;victory plan&#x2019; will focus on pushing the Russians back with military support, as well as strong backing from Europeans and Americans,&quot; said Taylor. He added that once Putin realizes, through this plan and international support, that victory is unattainable, he will seek a way out. Some U.S. officials have already seen parts of Zelensky&apos;s plan and believe it is a strategy &quot;that can work,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a press briefing on Sept. 17. Thomas-Greenfield added the U.S. plans to promote the plan among world leaders during the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York, which Zelensky will attend. When asked if Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he could end the war &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; is likely to support Zelensky&apos;s plan, Taylor said it&apos;s uncertain but emphasized that &quot;we do know where the American people are.&quot; U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (L) shakes hands with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting on the sideline of the Summit on peace in Ukraine, at the luxury Burgenstock resort, near Lucerne, Switzerland on June 15, 2024. (Alessandro Della Valle/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;There are strong supporters of Ukraine in the Congress, House, and Senate, who will have an influence on former President Trump if he&apos;s reelected.&quot; According to Panetta, the &#x201C;victory plan&quot; &quot;serves as an answer&quot; to the Republicans in Congress who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in April, citing the absence of a clear strategy for Ukraine&apos;s victory. Taylor also suggested Zelensky&apos;s U.S. visit could be pivotal in securing approval for Ukraine to use West-provided long-range weapons against targets deep inside Russia. He compared this potential shift to the U.S. secretly providing Ukraine with ATACMS missiles in March, revealed only after the first attack on Crimea. &quot;I think there&apos;s a very good chance that either quietly or publicly, the United States, Great Britain, France, and others will give the Ukrainians the green light to use these weapons against military targets in compliance with international law sometime over the next week or so,&quot; he said.

US to provide Ukraine with additional $375 million in military aid, Reuters reports	The U.S. will provide Ukraine with an additional package of $375 million in military aid, Reuters reported on Sept. 20, citing two unnamed U.S. government officials. The announcement of the package is expected sometime next week, the officials said. Foreign military assistance is crucial for Kyiv as the all-out war with Russia stretches past two and half years, with Russian forces pushing hard in Ukraine&apos;s east. If confirmed, it would be the largest tranche of military aid the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May earlier this year, when a package worth $275 million was delivered. The officials said the package would likely include patrol boats, ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, spare parts, and other military equipment. The exact quantities were not specified. The previous day, Reuters reported that Congress and the administration of President Joe Biden are close to an agreement on a one-year extension of $5.8 billion in military aid for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September. After the House of Representatives failed to pass a Republican-backed spending bill on Sept. 18 that did not include the PDA extension, the Democratic-led Senate said it would prepare a new bill to avert a shutdown. The sources told Reuters that the Senate bill should include the prolongation of the Ukraine aid funds. It remains unclear whether Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who delayed a $61 billion aid bill for Kyiv for months earlier this year, will support it. The $61 billion assistance package was eventually passed in April, allocating some $7.8 billion to the PDA and allowing the release of a number of defense aid tranches since then.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-with-additional-375-million-in-military-aid/	2024-09-20T13:13:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241658570-1658486054djzog.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia commanders reportedly warned of plans for Ukraine's Kursk incursion months in advance	Key developments on Sept. 20: Russian commanders anticipated that Ukraine was planning an incursion into Kursk Oblast months before it occurred, the Guardian reported on Sept. 20, citing a collection of documents that Ukrainian soldiers said they had seized from abandoned Russian positions. The documents included printed orders and handwritten entries from commanders. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, the authenticity of which the Guardian said they &quot;could not independently verify,&quot; Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024. While the earlier warnings were largely vague, they grew increasingly more detailed &#x2014; including specific threats that Ukraine would try to seize the town of Sudzha &#x2014; a warning that was realized after Ukraine captured it in August. The seized documents also revealed that Russian commanders had attempted to beef up security by the border in Kursk Oblast and &quot;organize additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organization of defenses&quot; ahead of a possible Ukrainian attack. Other revelations from the documents were statements from commanders about the deteriorating morale of Russian soldiers in the area. &quot;The analysis of the current situation regarding suicides shows that the issue of servicemen dying as a result of suicidal incidents remains tense,&quot; one entry read. Another entry detailed the specifics of one soldier&apos;s suicide. &quot;The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,&quot; the entry read. Commanders also wrote instructions on how to improve morale, including one suggestion that soldiers should receive daily political lessons &quot;aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral, and psychological condition of the personnel.&quot; The surviving members of a group of 14 men from Ghana who were lured into the Russian military to fight against Ukraine have appealed for help from Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ghanaian news outlet TV3 reported on Sept. 19. Russia continues to try to fill the ranks of its army with foreigners and migrant workers to avoid another round of domestic mobilization as losses from its ongoing war in Ukraine mount. According to TV3, the men arrived in Russia on Aug. 6 and were taken to Kostroma, a city in western Russia located 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of Moscow. Another man from Ghana was reportedly responsible for luring the group, promising them well-paid jobs in Russia. The men said they paid for their own plane tickets and visas and were told they would get a job working in security, but would first undergo training from the military. The men said they then signed a contract in Russian, a language none of the men speak, and their passports were later confiscated. Three men from the group told TV3 that they are being held against their will in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast and that they believe they may be the only surviving members of the original group of 14. Other members of the group were allegedly taken away to fight and one man escaped, but his whereabouts are unknown. &quot;We are presently in Ukraine...we have no fighting experience,&quot; one man told TV3. &quot;We are pleading, we want to return home.&quot; The families of the 14 men have appealed to the Ghanian Police Headquarters for help, TV3 journalist Godwin Asediba posted on X on Sept. 20. Similar cases of foreigners being lured into the Russian army have been reported in India, Egypt, Nepal, and Cuba, despite efforts from these countries to clamp down on the smuggling rings and recruitment schemes that drive men to Russia. The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. The French Air Force has been training Ukrainian pilots since March 2024 as part of the international coalition to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, which was founded at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023. Kyiv has been calling for its partners to provide F-16s jets since the very first year of the full-scale war in order to bolster its fleet of aircraft, which is otherwise made up of Soviet-made planes. While Ukraine has been promised nearly 80 jets from the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, the training of new pilots has been considered one of the main bottlenecks for expanding Ukraine&apos;s F-16 capabilities. The French Armed Forces wrote on X that the Alpha Jet training program shows &quot;France&apos;s firm support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; but did not provide further details. French newspaper Le Monde reported in June that the French Air Force had committed to training 26 Ukrainian pilots. This number is significant as the French Air Force usually certifies around 30 pilots a year, after up to five years of training. The program began in March with 10 Ukrainian pilots, who are training using Alphajets fitted with a panel that simulates the instruments in the cockpit of an F-16, Le Monde said. A group of Ukrainian pilots also recently arrived in Romania to start training on F-16 fighter jets, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sept. 12. Other Ukrainian pilots have undergone training in the U.S. or Denmark, though Copenhagen said it would not provide instructions to Ukrainian aviators on its territory past 2024. Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said on Sept. 20. Ukraine launched an overnight attack on Sept. 18 against one of the largest arsenals in Russia, opened in 2018 and built to withstand a nuclear explosion. According to Estonian news outlet ERR, Kiviselg commented on the strike during an Estonian Defense Ministry press conference. Ukraine was able to strike the depot because some of the ammunition was not located inside bunkers, causing a chain of explosions that destroyed 30,000 tons of ammunition to explode, Kiviselg said. &quot;At an average rate of military action, Russia fires 10,000 shells per week. That is, a two-to-three-month supply of ammunition,&quot; &quot;We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,&quot; Kiviselg said. The arms depot in Topolets stored ballistic missiles, including Iskanders, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery ammunition, and KAB guided bombs, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine has long suffered a disadvantage in terms of ammunition supplies compared to Russia. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN on Sept. 5 that Russian forces currently fire shells at a ratio of around 2:1 to 2.5:1 to Ukrainian forces. Norway&apos;s civil and military support program for Ukraine, known as the Nansen program, will be extended until 2030 and will be increased by a further 5 billion kroner ($475 million) this year, Oslo announced on Sept. 20. The Nansen program will now have a total value of 135 billion kroner ($12.8 billion). The program initially was set to spend 75 billion kroner ($7 billion) from 2023 to 2028. Oslo&apos;s decision will result in an additional $5.7 billion in Norwegian support for Ukraine until 2030, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. Zelensky said he was grateful to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and all political parties in the Norwegian Parliament. &quot;This unwavering commitment will help Ukraine protect lives, defend freedom, and strengthen our resilience,&quot; Zelensky said. Norwegian news outlet Nettavisen said that the decision to expand the Nansen program came after the government &quot;received massive criticism because Norway&apos;s support for Ukraine has lagged behind, compared to other countries.&quot; Almost all Norwegian opposition parties demanded a significant increase in support for Ukraine, Nettavisen said. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-31/	2024-09-20T12:02:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166312567.jpg

Bloomberg reported in June that Russia was coercing African students and migrants to fight by threatening to take away their visas if they did not agree to join the military. Indian media reported on Sept. 12 that 45 Indians tricked into joining the Russian military fighting in Ukraine have been released after the Indian government intervened, and Russian President Vladimir Putin met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/ghana-men-russia-appeal-for-help/	2024-09-20T11:32:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1763145621.jpg

Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway/	2024-09-20T09:01:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1636214818.jpg

Raiffeisen Bank agrees to sell Belarusian subsidiary	Austria-headquartered Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) agreed to sell its stake in its Belarusian subsidiary Priorbank, marking the first step toward fully withdrawing from the Belarusian market, RBI announced on Sept. 20. RBI has come under heavy criticism from Western institutions since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine for continuing its business in Russia and Belarus, thereby fuelling Russia&apos;s war through paying taxes. Raiffeisen is the largest remaining Western bank in Russia. Hesitant to fully withdraw from the Russian market, the bank eventually announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; reduce its operations in the country. The decision came after the European Parliament sent Austrian officials a letter in April, urging them to compel Raiffeisen to cease its activities in Russia in compliance with EU sanctions. The European Central Bank has also asked Raiffeisen to scale back its business in Russia by 2026. RBI said it had signed an agreement to sell its 87.74% stake in Priorbank to Soven 1 Holding Limited, an investor from the United Arab Emirates, after more than six months of negotiations. The sale is expected to create a loss of around 300 million euros ($335 million), &quot;which essentially results from the difference between the purchase price and the book value of the equity of Priorbank,&quot; RBI said. With the completion of this transaction to sell Priorbank, &quot;RBI will successfully withdraw from the Belarusian market and thus reduce operational complexity in line with its risk mitigation strategy in Eastern Europe,&quot; the Sept. 20 press release said. Earlier in September, a Russian court issued a preliminary ruling that banned the transfer of Raiffeisen shares. &quot;This complicates the sales process&quot; and will &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in Raiffeisen&apos;s exit from Russia, RBI said.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-sells-belarusian/	2024-09-20T08:00:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167927718.jpg
First group of Ukrainian pilots complete French jet training	The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. The French Air Force has been training Ukrainian pilots since March 2024 as part of the international coalition to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, which was founded at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023. &#xA0; &#xA0; Kyiv has been calling for its partners to provide F-16s jets since the very first year of the full-scale war in order to bolster its fleet of aircraft, which is otherwise made up of Soviet-made planes. While Ukraine has been promised nearly 80 jets from the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, the training of new pilots has been considered one of the main bottlenecks for expanding Ukraine&apos;s F-16 capabilities. Photos released by the French Air Force upon the completion of the training program for Ukrainian pilots on Sept. 20, 2024. (French Air and Space Force / X)Photos released by the French Air Force upon the completion of the training program for Ukrainian pilots on Sept. 20, 2024. (French Air and Space Force / X)The French Armed Forces wrote on X that the Alpha Jet training program shows &quot;France&apos;s firm support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; but did not provide further details. French newspaper Le Monde reported in June that the French Air Force had committed to training 26 Ukrainian pilots. This number is significant as the French Air Force usually certifies around 30 pilots a year, after up to five years of training. The program began in March with 10 Ukrainian pilots, who are training using Alphajets fitted with a panel that simulates the instruments in the cockpit of an F-16, Le Monde said. A group of Ukrainian pilots also recently arrived in Romania to start training on F-16 fighter jets, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sept. 12. Other Ukrainian pilots have undergone training in the U.S. or Denmark, though Copenhagen said it would not provide instructions to Ukrainian aviators on its territory past 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-pilots-complete-french-jet-training/	2024-09-20T06:39:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157350567.jpg
Russia missile strike on Odesa injures 4, damages civilian vessel	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story. Russian forces attacked Odesa on Sept. 20, injuring four people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. According to the preliminary data, Russia launched Iskander-M ballistic missiles, damaging port and civilian infrastructure, as well as a civilian ship under the Antiguan flag. An air raid alert sounded in Odesa Oblast at around 2 p.m. local time, and the first explosions were heard in the city a few minutes later. Odesa Oblast and other southern regions of Ukraine are regular targets of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russian troops attacked Odesa Oblast with a ballistic missile on July 4, killing one civilian, injuring seven others, and hitting port infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-odesa/	2024-09-20T06:02:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158388860.jpg
Ukraine approves new domestic-made all-terrain amphibious vehicle Takha	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has authorized the use of the all-terrain amphibious vehicle Takha for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to its Sept. 20 statement. The vehicle developed by Ukrainian engineers is already being used at the front line for evacuation, as well as for transportation of ammunition and food, according to the ministry. The Takha vehicle is small in size and can turn around on the spot, making it effective in maneuvering in limited spaces. It can also operate in swamps, floodplains, deep snow, and driving out of water on ice. The pressure on the surface created by its tires is less than that of a human foot, which allows it to move on loose and unstable ground, the statement read. The Takha vehicle can also overcome obstacles over one meter high and can carry up to one metric ton of cargo or up to 10 passengers. Its speed on land reaches 40 km/h (25 mph), and on water up to 6 km/h (3.7 mph). The all-terrain vehicle has several fuel tanks and can operate for over two days at a single refueling station. Over 110 models of Ukrainian and foreign-made military vehicles had been approved for use in Ukraine as of early June, the ministry said. One-third of the vehicles were reportedly domestically produced, while the rest were made in over 20 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Sweden, and Italy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-takha/	2024-09-20T05:46:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/84901dbb5f3b4fb0031a2a929cc6535c1d6f3c36.jpg
Putin won't visit ICC member Mexico for President-elect Sheinbaum's inauguration	Russian President Vladimir Putin will not fly to Mexico for the inauguration of President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said in an interview with RTVI channel on Sept. 20. The director of the ministry&apos;s Latin American Department, Alexander Shchetinin, confirmed that Russia had received an invitation from Mexico but said that Putin&apos;s representative would attend the inauguration instead. Mexico signed the Rome Statute in 2005 and is subject to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year. Ukraine asked the Mexican government to arrest Putin in accordance with the ICC warrant if he attended the inauguration of Sheinbaum on Oct. 1. The Mexican government said it would not accommodate Kyiv&apos;s request. Shchetinin did not give a reason for Putin&apos;s decision not to travel to Mexico but said that &quot;Moscow was acting within the existing protocol practice and the obligations of the Russian leader.&quot; In early September, Putin visited Mongolia at the invitation of Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh. This was his first trip to an ICC member country that has ratified the Rome Statute since the warrant was issued. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023 for the forcible transfer of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and the West called on Mongolia to arrest the Russian president. After the country failed to do so, Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry, said that Mongolia would face &quot;consequences&quot; for its decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-wont-fly-to-mexico/	2024-09-20T05:25:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169640595.jpg
Meta’s ban on Russian propaganda doesn’t go far enough, say disinformation experts	Tech companies&apos; recent efforts to crack down on Russian propaganda on social media are unlikely to hamper Moscow&#x2019;s campaign to undermine support for Ukraine, especially as major platforms, like X and Telegram, fail to take action. Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, banned Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya from its sites on Sept. 17 over &#x201C;foreign interference activity,&#x201D; a Meta spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. The decision came days after the U.S. claimed that RT was collaborating with Russian intelligence to target countries globally amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the Kremlin&#x2019;s disinformation campaigns. Meta warned that Russia remains the number one source of information warfare, pointing to the Kremlin&#x2019;s coordinated propaganda operation, codenamed &#x201C;Doppelganger,&#x201D; as its &#x201C;most persistent&#x201D; operation since 2017. Doppelganger clones legitimate news and government websites to disseminate anti-Western, pro-Russian, and anti-Ukrainian narratives that are then shared on social media by bots. Screenshot of Russia Today&apos;s (RT) Facebook page is not available. (The Kyiv Independent)Meta&#x2019;s ban may not be enough to suppress Russia&#x2019;s attempts to shape the narrative in key countries and grind down support for Ukraine among its allies. Moreover, X and Telegram &#x2014; platforms where Russian propaganda runs wild &#x2014; have done nothing to curb it. Even X&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, has shared Kremlin propaganda on his X account. Anti-Ukraine Kremlin propaganda on social media that seeks to undermine Kyiv&#x2019;s international credibility has even caused delays in vital arms shipments, said Ruslan Deynychenko, a founder of Ukrainian fact-checker StopFake who works with Meta. He points to an X post by far-right Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene that called funding for Ukraine &#x201C;the most corrupt money scheme of any foreign war in (the U.S&#x2019;) history,&#x201D; and linked to a Kremlin propaganda source that claimed Kyiv&#x2019;s politicians were suddenly earning millions of dollars. U.S. auditors found no evidence of flagrant misuse of financial aid to Ukraine after setting up an anti-corruption working group at the start of 2023. &#x201C;(Russia&#x2019;s) efforts are very effective. They make our efforts to defend our country less effective,&#x201D; Deynychenko told the Kyiv Independent. Content labeled Russian propaganda by Meta skyrocketed following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The company took quick action by blocking ads from Russian state-media, and restricting visibility on users&#x2019; feeds, Meta told the Kyiv Independent. As a result, Russian propaganda posts fell by 43% and engagement levels dropped by 80% by Aug. 24, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, according to an external analysis by Graphika, a social media analysis company. A Russia state-controlled Russia Today&apos;s (RT) television broadcast van is seen parked in front of St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral and the Kremlin next to Red Square in Moscow, Russia on March 16, 2018. (Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images)While praising Meta&#x2019;s latest steps, Deynychenko believes it is mostly &#x201C;symbolic,&#x201D; noting that Russian propagandists will find workarounds. To avoid Meta&#x2019;s previous restrictions, propagandists set up Facebook pages that seemingly have no connection to the Kremlin, like a page dedicated to soap operas, and disseminated propaganda there, he said. What&apos;s more, the ban is limited to Russian state-backed media and doesn&#x2019;t cover &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; news sites and commentators that espouse Russian propaganda, said Christian Mamo, founding member of Dutch-based non-profit group Osint for Ukraine. He points to The Grayzone, a U.S.-based media, which is still active on Facebook despite its founder Max Blumenthal frequently writing for and appearing on RT. &#x201C;Movements and individuals expressing pro-Russian views in the Western world don&apos;t get their narratives directly from RT, rather from localized institutions, &#x2018;influencers,&#x2019; and political movements and online commentators,&#x201D; Mamo told the Kyiv Independent, adding that Meta&#x2019;s decision won&#x2019;t achieve much with these restrictions. A Tennessee-based &#x201C;independent&#x201D; media platform, Tenet Media, was discovered last month to have received financing from Russia and hosted several prominent alt-right journalists who frequently criticized Ukraine and NATO. The U.S. Justice Department charged two RT employees for violating foreign agent and money laundering laws over funding the network. If the ban doesn&#x2019;t have any sincere impact, then Russia will continue eroding support for Ukraine and fomenting division in Europe, said Vadym Miskyi, program director of Detector Media, a Ukrainian think-tank. In the worst case scenario, it could lead to a drop in public and political will to support Kyiv long-term and cripple Ukraine&#x2019;s defense, he added. Russia doesn&#x2019;t just target Westerners but also Ukrainians, largely through Telegram, the number one source for news in Ukraine. Rather than promoting a pro-Russian agenda, Telegram accounts often disguise themselves as pro-Ukrainian but propagate demoralizing messages to push Ukraine to give up. They accuse the government of corruption or criticize the mobilization effort which is largely unpopular among civilians. Other narratives emphasize the mass losses of Ukrainians on the frontline or disunity among Ukrainian allies, said Mamo. But it is on X that Russian propaganda has the most credibility. Since Musk&#x2019;s takeover in 2022, Russian narratives have bled into X&#x2019;s mainstream discourse and are even amplified on Musk&#x2019;s personal account, noted Mamo. X did not reply to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment. Russian propagandists use X to promote anti-Ukrainian or pro-Russian narratives to an international audience, where it reaches journalists and traditional media that cover Ukraine, said Deynychenko. The propaganda is more sophisticated than other platforms, he claims, and voices like Musk add a certain authority when they share disinformation or memes. pic.twitter.com/W9i9YEM8uA In one instance, Musk shared a meme created by the Kremlin-backed organization the Social Design Agency (ASD), a joint investigation by over a dozen European newsrooms revealed. The meme, which mocks President Volodymyr Zelensky asking the U.S. for vital financial aid, has been viewed over 95 million times with 831,000 likes since it was posted in October 2023. Memes satirizing Ukraine&#x2019;s war efforts and political figures are particularly effective, says Deynychenko. Social media users are more likely to share memes they find funny over news stories, and humor is an effective shield against fact-checkers, he stressed. &#x201C;You cannot debunk humor and satire. You might look stupid when you debunk something that&apos;s circulating in the form of a meme or some other kind of joke,&#x201D; Deynychenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/metas-ban-on-russian-propaganda-doesnt-go-far-enough-say-disinformation-experts/	2024-09-20T04:54:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-986845144.jpg
Ukraine restricts Telegram use for government, military, critical infrastructure	Ukraine&apos;s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity on Sept. 20 restricted the use of Telegram messenger for government agencies, military, and critical infrastructure facilities. Telegram remains one of the most popular social media platforms among Ukrainians. A September 2023 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 44% of Ukrainians use Telegram to receive information and news. The app is also actively used by Russia, its military forces, and intelligence services to undermine Ukraine&apos;s war effort and boost its own. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, earlier called the messenger app &quot;harmful&quot; and a &quot;threat to our national security.&quot; During a recent meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, Budanov provided &quot;substantiated evidence&quot; that Russian intelligence services have access to Telegram users&apos; personal correspondence, even deleted messages, and their personal data. &quot;I have always advocated freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,&quot; Budanov said. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said that Telegram is actively used by Russia for cyberattacks, spreading phishing and malware, establishing user geolocation, and adjusting missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and villages. As a result, Ukraine&apos;s cybersecurity center decided to ban the Telegram app on official devices of government officials, military personnel, employees of the security and defense sector, and critical infrastructure enterprises. The only exceptions will be those for whom the use of this messenger is &quot;part of their official duties,&quot; according to the statement. The popularity of Telegram in Ukraine skyrocketed after the start of the invasion in 2022, particularly due to its anonymous channels that mass-spread content to subscribers while preserving the full anonymity of the publisher. Telegram CEO and co-founder Pavel Durov was briefly detained in France and later charged with &quot;complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group&quot; and other crimes. Russian-born Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but on Aug. 27, it was reported he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-restricts-telegram-for-government/	2024-09-20T04:31:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Russia struggles to rewire global trade amid sanctions, war, WSJ analysis says	Russia tried to establish ties with China and India in an effort to decouple from the West but faced new challenges along the way, The Wall Street Journal&apos;s (WSJ) analysis published on Sept. 20 said. As the full-scale invasion continues, Western countries are imposing increasingly severe sanctions on Russia, forcing it to seek new partnerships with China and India. Following the beginning of the all-out war, Russian trade with China, India, and other eastern countries increased, partially due to the sale of Russian oil at discounts. Cooperation with eastern partners was also facilitated by the fact that tankers could transport oil instead of stationary pipelines. Russia was thus able to circumvent the Western price cap by transporting oil through a so-called shadow fleet of outdated tankers that were not subject to sanctions. This mobility has been crucial for Russia&apos;s resource-dependent economy, helping the Kremlin raise revenue to finance the war and support the sanctions-hit economy, according to the analysis. In 2023, half of Russia&apos;s oil and petroleum product exports went to China, and India also became a major buyer, the media outlet said. Redirecting natural gas proved to be more problematic, as most of Russia&apos;s exports went to Europe, particularly through the Nord Stream pipeline, which was cut off in 2022. Russia currently has limited capacity to transport gas to China, and Beijing has not yet authorized the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline between the two countries. Natural gas can also be liquefied and transported on specialized tankers, but U.S. sanctions limit Russia&apos;s ability to do so. Russia is trying to expand its outdated railroad infrastructure to Asia, as existing lines cannot cope with the growing trade volume. Bureaucratic disputes over capacity allocation have affected the rail-dependent coal industry. The sector, which had priority access to the railroad, now competes with other cargoes, including timber, steel, and containerized shipping, bringing Chinese goods instead of European ones. Meanwhile, the analysis said that Russian coal exports to China are currently stagnating. Moscow was counting on the melting ice in the Arctic Ocean to make the shipping route through Russia&apos;s northern waters a center of global trade, but U.S. sanctions have prevented Russia from getting icebreakers. Russia also seeks to reduce the time it takes to export to the Indian market by using the so-called North-South transport corridor through Iran. Yet the lack of rail infrastructure in Iran, limited port capacity, and uncertainty over funding sources are delaying plans to make this route viable, the WSJ said, citing experts. Russia has been adapting to Western sanctions, using smuggling and various schemes to acquire the sanctioned goods. Last December, Ukraine&apos;s state agency released a report listing roughly 2,500 foreign-made components found in Russian weaponry on the battlefield, with roughly three-quarters originating in the U.S. Russia&apos;s allies transfer the required goods through third countries, bypassing sanctions. China, which has declared itself neutral in the war between Ukraine and Russia, is nevertheless one of Russia&apos;s largest suppliers of dual-use goods. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023. India overtook China as the world&#x2019;s largest importer of Russian oil in July as Chinese refiners bought less due to lower profit margins from fuel production, Reuters reported on Aug. 22, citing a comparison of import data. The Financial Times reported on Sept. 5 that Russia and India developed covert trade links so that the Kremlin could acquire components needed for its war effort. Citing Russian state correspondence seen by the outlet, the Kremlin&apos;s industry and trade ministry acquired critical electronics and explored the possibility of building facilities in India to produce them. The documents showed the plan was to be financed by &quot;significant reserves&quot; of rupees amassed from oil sales to &#xA0;and would source goods &quot;previously supplied from unfriendly countries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-and-global-economy-wsj/	2024-09-20T04:12:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170784701.jpg
American pro-Kremlin fighter tortured to death by Russian soldiers, Russian investigators say	Russell Bentley, a pro-Kremlin American man who fought against Ukraine in 2014 and was killed under previously unknown circumstances in April, was tortured to death by Russian soldiers, Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee said on Sept. 20. Concluding a preliminary investigation into the case, the committee accused Russian military service members Vitaly Vansyatsky, Vladislav Agaltsev, Vladimir Bazhin, and Andrei Iordanov of taking part in the crime in various roles. Bentley, who died at the age of 63-64, was a U.S. military veteran and self-identified supporter of Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. Local occupation authorities claimed Bentley went missing on April 8 after a district in occupied Donetsk Oblast was shelled by Ukrainian troops. His wife reportedly told the Mash Telegram channel that he went to see if other residents needed help after the strikes and never returned. Russia&apos;s investigative committee concluded that Vansyatsky, Agaltsev, and Iordanov tortured and killed Bentley in occupied Donetsk, Ukraine, on April 8. Vansyatsky and Agaltsev then allegedly denoted a car with his body the same day. On April 9, Vansyatsky instructed Bazhin to cover up the crime by removing Bentley&apos;s remains from the scene, the investigators said. The statement did not name a possible motive for the alleged crime. The committee submitted its conclusions to the court. The soldiers have been charged with abuse of power resulting in death, desecrating a body, and concealment of a crime. Russia was actively recruiting and transporting foreign fighters to join Moscow-backed proxy forces in Donbas at the start of the war in 2014, heavily employing propaganda for that purpose. Bentley, who was a self-described communist and spent five years in a U.S. prison for smuggling, said he had joined Russian proxy forces to fight &quot;against fascism,&quot; reiterating Russian propaganda talking points about the &quot;fascist-ruled&quot; government in Kyiv. The Texas native also launched his own YouTube channel and worked as a &quot;war correspondent&quot; for the Russian propaganda channel Sputnik.	https://kyivindependent.com/american-pro-kremlin-fighter-tortured-killed-by-russian-soldiers-investigators-say/	2024-09-20T03:48:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GKfQq2NWkAAYkwh.jpeg
EU's von der Leyen unveils up to 35 billion euro loan to Ukraine as part of G7 pledge	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sept. 20 announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50-billion pledge by the G7. &quot;Relentless Russian attacks means Ukraine needs continued EU support,&quot; the chief of the EU&apos;s executive arm said during her visit to Kyiv. &quot;The European Commission will provide a loan of up to 35 billion euros to Ukraine as part of the G7 pledge. This is another major EU contribution to Ukraine&apos;s recovery.&quot; Von der Leyen arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital earlier on Sept. 20 to discuss Europe&apos;s support in various areas &quot;from winter preparedness to defense, to accession and progress on the G7 loans.&quot; The G7 agreed in June to provide Ukraine with a loan of $50 billion by the end of the year, covered by proceeds from immobilized Russian assets. The plan now stands on shaky ground as the U.S., which was supposed to shoulder $20 billion of the sum, is reluctant to commit unless the EU extends the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. Such a step requires a unanimous vote, which is currently being blocked by Hungary, the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-proximate member. The Financial Times (FT) reported on Sept. 17 that the EU is now drafting plans to provide the loan with or without U.S. support, aiming to gather between 20 billion and 40 billion euros ($22.3-44.5 billion). The outlet comments that the sum of 35 billion euros is a compromise that will allow Washington to step in at a later date. Ukraine is in dire need of such a financial injection as Russia targets its energy infrastructure with missiles and drones and presses its ground offensive in the east. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the G7 for the pledged $50 billion loan but also urged the creation of a mechanism for the full confiscation of $300 billion in frozen Russian funds. Roughly two-thirds are held at Belgium-based financial service company Euroclear.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-35-billion/	2024-09-20T03:05:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157219393.jpg
Europe too 'reticent' in energy support for Ukraine ahead of winter, IEA chief says	The head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, criticized European governments for being too &quot;reticent&quot; in supporting Ukraine&apos;s energy sector ahead of winter, the third one since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, The Financial Times (FT) reported on Sept. 20. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to the IEA report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. &quot;It&apos;s time for everybody to understand that this winter could be consequential in Ukraine,&quot; Birol told the FT, adding that &quot;this is the most pressing energy security issue today in the world.&quot; According to Birol, the lack of energy resources will affect the work of hospitals, schools, and the water supply and have other &quot;major implications.&quot; Birol said there were &quot;major shortages&quot; of crucial parts, including transformers, grid equipment, and diesel generators. He added that Europe has been too &quot;conservative&quot; in providing Ukraine with additional electricity and could increase exports without jeopardizing European supplies. European consumers could help by cutting their electricity demand, allowing more power to flow to their eastern neighbor. It would be &quot;a very decent way to show solidarity,&quot; Birol said. The EU will support Ukraine with 160 million euros ($178 million) ahead of winter to improve the country&apos;s resilience to Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sept. 19. Around 60 million euros ($67 million) of the EU aid will go toward humanitarian aid such as shelters and heaters. Roughly 100 million euros ($111 million) will be spent on repairing energy infrastructure and developing renewable energy. EU ambassadors agreed on May 8 to use the windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Kyiv is expected to receive roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) every year, according to earlier discussions.

US Congress nears deal on extending $6 billion in Ukraine aid before expiration, Reuters reports	U.S. Congress and the Biden administration are close to an agreement on a one-year extension of $5.8 billion in military aid for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September, Reuters reported on Sept. 19, citing two undisclosed sources. The U.S. administration requested Congress to extend the remaining sum in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), a key tool for supplying Ukraine with arms from Pentagon stocks, to prevent it from expiring by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Foreign military assistance is crucial for Kyiv as the all-out war with Russia stretches for two and half years, with Russian forces pushing hard in Ukraine&apos;s east. There is bipartisan support in Congress to extend the PDA in a Continuing Resolution, a short-term emergency bill that U.S. lawmakers must pass within the next 11 days to avoid a government shutdown, Reuters wrote. After the House of Representatives failed to pass a Republican-backed spending bill on Sept. 18 that did not include the PDA extension, the Democratic-led Senate said it would prepare a new bill to avert a shutdown. The sources told Reuters that the Senate bill should include the prolongation of the Ukraine aid funds. It remains unclear whether Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who delayed a $61 billion aid bill for Kyiv for months earlier this year, will support it. The $61 billion assistance package was eventually passed in April, allocating some $7.8 billion to the PDA and allowing the release of a number of defense aid tranches since then. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that while he is grateful for Congress&apos;s decision, the aid is nevertheless trickling down too slowly as Ukraine cannot equip even &quot;four out of the 14 brigades&quot; the country is mustering. This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of the $7.8 billion in PDA allocated for this fiscal year remains unused. A congressional aid told the Kyiv Independent that the delays are connected to domestic U.S. stock constraints and a &quot;constant flexibility issue with each withdrawal&quot; in a situation where the U.S. adapts to Ukraine&apos;s needs. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that there is a &quot;lack of the necessary weapons in the Pentagon&apos;s warehouses.&quot; Washington unveiled its latest aid package worth $250 million during a Ramstein group meeting on Sept. 6. It included anti-air missiles, artillery shells, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, HIMARS missiles, and other assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congress-nears-deal-on-6-billion/	2024-09-20T01:56:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157612510.jpg
Kyiv 2nd worst in world's air quality amid fires in region	Kyiv authorities warned about sharp and &quot;temporary deterioration&quot; of air quality in Kyiv on Sept. 20 due to the accumulation of harmful substances. The likely cause is fires in Kyiv Oblast that released large amounts of dust particles in the air, the environmental department of the Kyiv city military administration said. Authorities warned on Sept. 16 that the air quality in the capital may worsen due to fires in the Vyshhorod district of Kyiv Oblast. Large-scale fires were also recorded elsewhere in Ukraine recently amid dry weather and &#x2013; in some areas &#x2013; constant Russian attacks. The IQAir air quality index places Kyiv as the second most polluted city in the world as of 11 a.m., with only Cairo ranked higher. Earlier in the day, Kyiv was ranked the worst city in the world before a sudden deterioration of the pollution levels in Cario. Kyiv has a rating of 181 on the 0-500 scale, which is classified as &quot;unhealthy&quot; and calls for reduced outdoor exertion by residents of the affected area. The pollution level is currently 19.7 times the WHO annual air quality guideline value. The Kyiv city authorities called upon the residents to close windows, avoid staying outdoors, drink lots of water, and turn on air purifiers. The pollutants recorded in the air included nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Kyiv has been ranked among the 30 cities with the cleanest air both in 2022 and 2023, positioned close to capitals like Madrid or Tokyo.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-air-pollution/	2024-09-20T01:06:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172302126.jpg
Germany has overcome shortage of Russian gas and is ready for winter, minister says	Germany has resolved the energy crisis and is ready for the coming winter of 2025, German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in comments quoted by Bild on Sept. 19. &quot;There is no more gas shortage,&quot; Habeck said during a dialog with the citizens in the city of Osnabruck, adding that Germany no longer has a need for Russian gas. Russia began tightening screws on gas supplies to Europe in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions. Russia&apos;s state energy giant Gazprom suspended direct supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany in 2022. The following year, Germany signed an agreement with Norway, Europe&apos;s largest gas producer, increasing the share of Norwegian supplies to 60%, comparable to the amount Russia used to account for. Germany&apos;s natural gas storage facilities are full, and all goals have been met, according to Habeck. Yet the official said that gas prices in Germany are &quot;higher than before the war in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Prices are higher; this also applies to gas, but not because we have a shortage,&quot; the minister said, adding that the real reason is that Asian nations are buying out liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to extreme heat in their countries. Habeck expressed confidence that gas prices will fall again when additional LNG volumes are released and enter the German market. Overall, gas prices in Germany will be only &quot;moderately higher than in the years before the pandemic,&quot; he claimed. Ukraine currently transits Russian gas to the EU as part of a deal signed in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. Europe and Ukraine are in talks with Azerbaijan about replacing Russia as a supplier. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transit Azeri gas after Ukraine stopped transiting Russian gas. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan would have to first transit through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. &quot;Russia, Ukraine, and European institutions have approached us in connection with the continuation of gas transit through the territory of Ukraine,&quot; Aliyev said. &quot;For several months, we have been making great efforts to come to a common denominator.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-has-overcome-gas-shortage/	2024-09-20T00:32:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 33 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 33 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Sept. 20. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 61 of the 70 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Nine drones were &quot;lost&quot; in Ukraine as a result of &quot;active measures&quot; by Ukrainian forces. A Kh-59 cruise missile was also reportedly shot down overnight. In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and 17 people injured over the past day, the regional military administration reported. Russia launched an airstrike against the city of Sumy late on Sept. 19, hitting a retirement home, killing one person, and injuring 14, officials said. Three other people were reportedly injured during an airstrike against the Seredyna-Buda community earlier the same day. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were killed and eight injured over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two people were killed during an attack against Chasiv Yar, and one was killed in Kostiantynivka. Two injuries were reported in the village of Rivne, two in Kurakhivka, and one each in Kurakhove, Zoria, Zarichne, and Serebrianka, the governor said. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast killed an 85-year-old man in the town of Vilcha near Vovchansk, injured a 65-year-old man in Kupiansk, and wounded two people in the village of Shestakove, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five people were injured during Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. A critical infrastructure facility, five multi-story buildings, and 14 houses were damaged. Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Luhansk, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Rivne, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-93/	2024-09-20T00:21:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Donets.jpg
Ukraine slaps new sanctions against individuals, entities from Iran, China, Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Sept. 19 imposing sanctions against six individuals and over 40 entities from Iran, China, and Russia. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has been expanding the list of sanctions against people or entities over their support for Moscow&apos;s war. China, despite its declared neutrality in the war, is Russia&apos;s leading supplier of dual-use goods, while Iran regularly provides Russia with Shahed-type drones and, more recently, ballistic missiles. Ukraine introduced sanctions against six foreigners associated with the supply and purchase of drones to Russia, including the director of the Iranian company Pishgam Electronic Safeh Company (PESC), Hamid Reza Janghorbani, and the official representative of the Hong Kong company Hongkong Himark Electron Model Limited, Yang Fan (China). The sanctions list also included Russian citizens Alexander Fedorko, Igor Dyugurov, Valentina Grigorieva, Liliya Alimova, and their Russian businesses. Ukraine imposed restrictions against 40 legal entities from Russia, Iran, and China as well. The sanctions list included Saad Sazeh Faraz Sharif, director of the Iranian company Shakad Sanat Asmari, as well as the heads and deputies of the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The recent sanctions also targeted the Russian ship lighting plant Mayak and the Kazan State Gunpowder Plant. The U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also announced updates to its sanctions list on Sept. 19, adding the names of five entities and one individual in violation of regulations the U.S. has placed on North Korea. North Korea and Russia have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In January, the U.S. announced sanctions on a Russian state-owned airline involved in the transfer of North Korean ballistic missiles to Russia. South Korea has warned that North Korea may be supplying Russia with tactical guided missiles and over six million artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-introduces-new-sanctions/	2024-09-19T23:34:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Zelensky-in-Italy.jpeg

Von der Leyen arrives in Kyiv to discuss Ukraine's energy needs with Zelensky	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Sept. 20 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy needs ahead of the coming winter. &quot;My 8th visit to Kyiv comes as the heating season starts soon, and Russia keeps targeting energy infrastructure,&quot; von der Leyen said on X. &quot;We will help Ukraine in its brave efforts,&quot; the chief of the EU&apos;s executive arm said, adding she will discuss Europe&apos;s support &quot;from winter preparedness to defense, to accession and progress on the G7 loans.&quot; In his evening address on Sept. 19, Zelensky said he is expecting &quot;important talks&quot; with von der Leyen as Ukraine braces for what some warn might be the &quot;sternest&quot; winter of the war yet.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-arrives-in-kyiv/	2024-09-19T22:24:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/von-der-2.jpg
Guardian: Russia commanders warned of plans for Ukraine's Kursk incursion months in advance, seized documents show	Russian commanders anticipated that Ukraine was planning an incursion into Kursk Oblast months before it occurred, the Guardian reported on Sept. 20, citing a collection of documents that Ukrainian soldiers said they had seized from abandoned Russian positions. The documents included printed orders and handwritten entries from commanders. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, the authenticity of which the Guardian said they &quot;could not independently verify,&quot; Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024. While the earlier warnings were largely vague, they grew increasingly more detailed &#x2014; including specific threats that Ukraine would try to seize the town of Sudzha &#x2014; a warning that was realized after Ukraine captured it in August. The seized documents also revealed that Russian commanders had attempted to beef up security by the border in Kursk Oblast and &quot;organize additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organization of defenses&quot; ahead of a possible Ukrainian attack. Other revelations from the documents were statements from commanders about the deteriorating morale of Russian soldiers in the area. &quot;The analysis of the current situation regarding suicides shows that the issue of servicemen dying as a result of suicidal incidents remains tense,&quot; one entry read. Another entry detailed the specifics of one soldier&apos;s suicide. &quot;The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,&quot; the entry read. Commanders also wrote instructions on how to improve morale, including one suggestion that soldiers should receive daily political lessons &quot;aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral, and psychological condition of the personnel.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/guardian-russia-commanders-warned-of-plans-for-ukraines-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-documents-show/	2024-09-19T21:40:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166685743.jpg
Kremlin begins criminal investigation into chief editor of Russian independent media outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe	Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has begun a criminal investigation into Kirill Martynov, the chief editor of the independent Russian media outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe, the state-run news organization TASS reported on Sept. 19, citing law enforcement officials. The Investigative Committee reportedly alleged that Martynov was &quot;conducting activities of an undesirable organization.&quot; Novaya Gazeta Europe is an offshoot of the Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta. It was formed in Latvia shortly after the beginning of the full-scale war and subsequent Russian crackdown on free speech. Novaya Gazeta had its media license stripped in Russia in September 2022. In June 2023, Russia&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office declared Novaya Gazeta Europe an &quot;undesirable&quot; organization. The law on &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations has existed since 2015 and has been used to target perceived opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime, including NGOs, independent media outlets, human rights groups, and others. The Russian government passed a law in May expanding the list of &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations to include those funded by foreign states. Following a subsequent court case brought by Russian organizations operating outside of the country, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the expanded law violates the European Convention on Human Rights. &quot;Undesirable&quot; organizations are banned from operating in Russia, and it is illegal for individuals or other media outlets to share their content. Leaders of such organizations can face up to six years in prison, and members could receive prison sentences of up to four years.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-begins-criminal-investigation-into-chief-editor-of-russian-independent-media-outlet-novaya-gazeta-europe/	2024-09-19T20:16:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1243534938.jpg
EU considering ending Georgia's visa-free access over ruling party's democratic backsliding	The EU is weighing the potential end to Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the bloc as a result of democratic backsliding under the ruling Georgian Dream party, Politico reported on Sept. 19, citing an unnamed spokesperson for the European Commission. &quot;All options are on the table&quot; if Georgia does not reverse its trend toward authoritarianism, &quot;including the potential temporary suspension of the visa liberalization scheme,&quot; the spokesperson told Politico. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. Georgia&apos;s traditional Western partners &#x2014; the EU and the U.S., have responded to the law&apos;s passage and related crackdown on protesters by halting aid, effectively freezing the country&apos;s EU bid, and sanctioning government officials. The proposed plan to end Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the EU, first granted in 2017, was the latest step in the deteriorating relations between Georgia and the West. &quot;As part of the EU-Georgia visa liberalization dialogue and the corresponding Action Plan, Georgia was required to meet specific benchmarks, including ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and preventing discrimination,&quot; the European Commission spokesperson said. &quot;An assessment would of course take place in case of developments posing a risk to the internal security of the Schengen area, as well as in case of a further democratic decline in Georgia.&quot; Following rumors in recent days that the visa-free regime might be ended, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze characterized the proposal as a &quot;cheap blackmail attempt.&quot; Kobakhidze further claimed that &quot;it will not have an impact on the election,&quot; referring to the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October. Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, is seeking a fourth term. The previous day, Georgia&apos;s parliament passed a package of anti-LGBTQ legislation that would ban gender transition, adoption by same-sex couples, and forbid gatherings or the distribution of information &quot;aimed at promoting&quot; LGBTQ relationships. The legislation was widely condemned by Georgia&apos;s Western allies, who reiterated concerns that the government&apos;s trajectory is hurting the country&apos;s Euro-Atlantic goals. A day after the parliament passed the set of bills, Kesaria Abramidze, one of Georgia&apos;s most prominent transgender public figures, was murdered. Police have arrested her boyfriend, who is suspected in Abramidze&apos;s killing. In response to the murder, the human rights NGO Social Justice Center said, &quot;There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ending-georgias-visa-free-access-over-ruling-partys-democratic-backsliding/	2024-09-19T17:43:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2151494694.jpg
Bulgarian far-right party’s foreign agent bill fails in committee vote	The Bulgarian Parliament&apos;s Committee on Culture and Media voted down a bill on Sept. 19 proposed by its chairperson belonging to the Vuzrazhdane (Revival) Party to create a registry of &quot;foreign agents.&quot;Founded in 2014 and described by some as pro-Russian, Revival came in third in Bulgaria&apos;s snap parliamentary election in June, gaining 41 seats in the 240-seat parliament. Revival has supported maintaining Bulgaria&apos;s &quot;deep ties&quot; with Russia.Despite Revival&apos;s claims that its proposed foreign agent law is similar to U.S. law, in both Bulgaria and Russia, individuals working as &quot;foreign agents&quot; would be barred from working in educational institutions and certain ministries and &quot;must mark&#x2026;any material (they) create with a large inscription on the title page &#x2014; foreign agent. Just like in Russia,&quot; public broadcaster Bulgarian National Television (BNT) said. A similar foreign agents law was signed into law in Georgia by the ruling Georgian Dream party in June and has been criticized for enabling authorities to monitor NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20% of their income from abroad. Washington and Brussels have denounced the bill as incompatible with Western values, and the European Council froze Georgia&apos;s EU accession process in response to its passage. Revival had recently had success in passing anti-LGTBQ legislation, mirroring the passage of anti-LGBTQ legislation by Georgian Dream and similar moves in Russia.Initially a hesitant partner, Bulgaria has become increasingly supportive of Kyiv as the war has progressed. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but pro-Russian sentiment has remained strong in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-far-right-partys-foreign-agent-bill-fails-in-committee-vote/	2024-09-19T17:32:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Delivering more weapons to Ukraine will help ‘end the war’ sooner, Stoltenberg says	During a speech at a German Marshall Fund event on Sept. 19, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated his support for further providing Western-made weaponry to Ukraine, noting that additional deliveries will continue to help Ukraine push back against Russian aggression on the battlefield. &quot;The paradox is that the more weapons for Ukraine we are able to deliver, the more likely it is that we can reach a peace and end to the war,&quot; Stoltenberg said. &quot;The more credible our long-term military support, the sooner the war will end.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s comments come amid intensified rhetoric and saber-rattling from Russian President Vladimir Putin and various Russian officials. Russia has repeatedly attempted to draw &quot;red lines&quot; in recent months as Western countries contemplate allowing Ukraine to use Western long-range missiles to strike deep within Russian territory. While many NATO allies have responded by reassuring Ukraine of its support with the delivery of weapons, other political leaders have opposed additional weapons deliveries, and have instead called for negotiations with Moscow. During his speech on Sept. 19, Stoltenberg rebuffed the notion of sustained peace without adequate support for Ukraine, stating that &quot;any future deal must be backed by strong military support to Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We all want this war to end. The quickest way to end the war is to lose it. But that will not bring peace. It will bring Russian occupation.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s comments on additional weapons deliveries come just days after the outgoing NATO chief said that the bloc could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;Now we provide military stuff to a war &#x2014; then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,&quot; Stoltenberg told the German newspaper FAS on Sept. 14. Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance&apos;s ongoing commitments to Kyiv &quot;constitute a bridge to Ukraine&apos;s membership.&quot; On Sept. 19, Stoltenberg doubled down on his past statement on, adding that there can be &quot;no lasting security for Ukraine, without NATO membership.&quot; &quot;NATO&#x2019;s door is open. Ukraine will join,&quot; Stoltenberg concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/providing-ukraine-with-more-weaponry-will-make-it-more-likely-to-end-war-stoltenberg-says/	2024-09-19T16:44:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1518191919.jpg
Germany plans additional $445 million in aid for Ukraine in 2024, AFP reports	Despite reporting in August by the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) that Berlin was not planning to approve additional aid to Kyiv this year, a German Finance Ministry document showed an additional 400 million euros ($445 million) in additional support earmarked for Ukraine, AFP reported on Sept. 19, citing the document in question.According to the document &#x2014; a letter to the parliamentary budget committee &#x2014; additional funds are needed to &quot;fulfill the German government&apos;s support commitments to the Ukrainian armed forces.&quot; The funds are required to provide military support, such as drones and air defense equipment &quot;without delay,&quot; to bolster Ukraine on the battlefield for the remainder of 2024.Reuters reported in May, citing an unnamed source, that Berlin planned to up its military aid to Ukraine by another 3.8 billion euros ($4.13 billion) in 2024. However, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; request was not approved by the Finance Ministry, according to FAZ.Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Berlin will provide Kyiv with around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) this year, but the aid will be reportedly cut by half &#x2014; to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) &#x2014; in 2025. Berlin had been hoping that the shortfall in assistance would be made up by Ukraine receiving $50 billion in profits from frozen Russian assets. However, Hungary has caused delays in the U.S.&apos;s procedural involvement in the assets scheme. &#xA0;In addition to budgetary concerns, &quot;anti-war&quot; parties that oppose aid to Ukraine on the right and left made gains in regional elections on Sept. 1, causing political complications for Germany&apos;s commitment to support Ukraine.According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), as of June 2024, Germany has allocated 14.7 billion euros ($16.4 billion) in support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-plans-additional-445-million-in-aid-for-ukraine-in-2024-afp-reports/	2024-09-19T15:52:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-200515448-001.jpg
Trump's campaign appearance with Polish President Duda canceled, sources tell Reuters	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has canceled his previously planned campaign appearance with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Reuters reported on Sept. 19, citing sources familiar with Trump&apos;s campaign schedule. The previous day, anonymous sources told Reuters that Trump planned a joint appearance with Duda at a monument at a Polish-American Roman Catholic shrine near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The reasons for the cancelation were not specified. It is unknown if Trump and Duda plan to meet elsewhere on the campaign trail. Foreign leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky and Duda, are convening in New York City over the next few days for the 79th General Assembly of the U.N. &quot;Probably, yes,&quot; Trump answered when asked by a reporter if he plans to meet Zelensky during his visit to the U.S. He did not provide additional details on any planned meeting. Pennsylvania is a battleground state in the U.S. presidential election and boasts a large Polish-American population. Vice President Kamala Harris leveraged the Polish-American community in a critique of Trump during the Sept. 10 debate, also held in Pennsylvania. &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,&quot; she said. Duda, a nationalist politician, has expressed staunch support for Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia while maintaining that Poland&apos;s interests come first and forging close ties with Trump and other U.S. Republicans. Trump and Duda met in New York City in April to discuss a range of foreign policy issues, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-campaign-appearance-with-polish-president-duda-canceled-sources-tell-reuters/	2024-09-19T14:47:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2149039914.jpg
US sanctions Russian individuals, entities engaging in prohibited transactions with North Korea	The U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced updates to its sanctions list on Sept. 19, adding the names of five entities and one individual in violation of regulations the U.S. has placed on North Korea.&quot;Today&apos;s action holds accountable parties that have assisted (North Korea) and Russian sanctions evasion,&quot; said Treasury official Bradley Smith. &quot;The U.S. remains strongly committed to leveraging all our available tools to disrupt this and other schemes intended to support Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine and enable (North Korea&apos;s) illicit access to the international financial system.&quot;North Korea and Russia have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.&quot;North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else,&quot; Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, said earlier in September, discussing countries that offer the most military support to Russia.In January, the U.S. announced sanctions on a Russian state-owned airline involved in the transfer of North Korean ballistic missiles to Russia. South Korea has warned that North Korea may be supplying Russia with tactical guided missiles and over six million artillery shells. MRB Bank, the &quot;International Settlement Bank&quot; LLC, one of the entities updated as violating sanctions on North Korea, has been providing banking services in Russian-occupied territories under the control of Russia&apos;s Central Bank since 2014.One of the involved sanctioned North Korean entities has been designated as serving as North Korea&apos;s primary foreign currency exchange bank and &quot;is vital to the illicit financial networks (North Korea) uses to finance its WMD and ballistic missile programs,&quot; the Treasury said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-individuals-entities-engaging-in-prohibited-transactions-with-north-korea/	2024-09-19T14:14:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157653203.jpg
US Ambassador Brink: ‘We have some sense of contours of Zelensky’s victory plan’	The Kyiv Independent spoke with the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink on Sept. 19 on the sidelines of the National Media Talk, an annual journalism conference held in Kyiv, and supported by USAID and Internews. The following is the transcript of the interview: The Kyiv Independent: Thank you for doing this, and for supporting this event &#x2013; that&#x2019;s important for the journalistic community. Something that we are watching very closely now is President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s upcoming visit to Washington next week. What are your expectations for the visit? Ambassador Brink: I was so delighted today to talk to media, government, and civil society representatives at a very important media event in Kyiv, even in wartime circumstances. Free media, independent media is very important to Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join Europe, to join NATO. It&apos;s a delight to be here. With regard to President Zelensky&apos;s visit to the United States. I know my president is very much looking forward to hosting him in the United States. I know he will have other meetings as well. We&apos;re looking forward to hearing his views on the future. He has said very clearly that he&apos;s going to present those to President Biden. President Biden and his team will be glad to do this meeting with President Zelensky and follow up. The Kyiv Independent: We know that President Zelensky is going to present his victory plan, which is now fully complete, as of yesterday. Have you had a chance to take a look at it? What do you expect from it? &#xA0; Ambassador Brink: President Zelensky has been very clear that he is going to show this plan first to President Biden. He and his team have been true to that. We have some sense of the contours of this plan, and of course, we&apos;re working hand in glove with the government to support your victory in many different ways. It&apos;ll be very positive for us to receive the details of the victory plan and be able to work together to follow up on this. The Kyiv Independent: Is the U.S. still ready to support Ukraine&apos;s full victory, meaning the return of all territories, including Crimea, and the full military defeat of Russia? Ambassador Brink: Look, our position has been very clear as articulated by the president, as articulated by Secretary Blinken when he was just here last week in Kyiv. We support Ukraine and its victory in its win against Russia&apos;s aggression. Now our support is in support of a vision of Ukraine &#x2013; sovereign, independent, democratic, prosperous, integrated into Europe and into NATO. So that vision is a vision from Ukrainians, and it&apos;s a vision of the future that we support. That&apos;s our position. We&apos;re leaving the details of the war, the details of when and how to negotiate up to your democratically elected president. The Kyiv Independent: Should we be hopeful about a change in the U.S. policy on allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles on Russian territory? Ambassador Brink: I&apos;m not going to get ahead of where my president and administration are. We have heard the request. I can tell you we will continue to support Ukrainians in your effort to fight against Russia&apos;s aggression. We will continue to adjust and adapt how we are supporting you, and we will work really closely and are working very closely with your government and administration in order to achieve that goal. The Kyiv Independent: What can you say to Ukrainians and supporters of Ukraine from around the world who are watching anxiously what&apos;s going to happen with the U.S. presidential election and how it will impact the war and the future of Ukraine? Ambassador Brink: Well, in my position as the president&apos;s representative in Kyiv, I cannot comment on our politics. What I can say is this: I spend a lot of time in America, in many parts of America, on the East Coast, on the West Coast. I&apos;m from the Midwest. There is strong bipartisan support for Ukraine, for your fight for freedom, for the values that we share together, and for the future that you envision for yourself. This is important for your country, but it&apos;s also important for European security and U.S. vital national interests. That&apos;s my view. That&apos;s the view of foreign policy experts across the political spectrum. That&apos;s the administration&apos;s view. And so that well of support is very important to have and one which we are going to use to keep supporting your effort to fight Russia&apos;s aggression. The Kyiv Independent: We&apos;re talking today at the National Media Talk, an event focusing on media in wartime. As you very well know, at the beginning of the year, Ukrainian journalists raised concerns about certain attempts at intimidation, surveillance, and so on. What is your message to those actors in Ukraine who are willing to try to suppress free media during wartime and who see independent journalism as a threat? Ambassador Brink: Our position is very clear on free media. It is vital, it&apos;s critical. Efforts of harassment and intimidation &#x2013; wherever they come from &#x2013; against independent and free media don&apos;t have a place in a country that&apos;s trying to move into the EU or NATO. The Kyiv Independent: There&apos;s been a government reshuffle recently that has attracted a lot of interest. Is there anything that the embassy is watching especially closely within the reshuffle? The civil society has been raising concerns a lot lately about the consolidation of power in the energy sector, specifically with Minister Herman Halushchenko and with the firing of the chief of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi. Is this an area that you&apos;re watching? Do you have any comments on that? Ambassador Brink: The members of the government &#x2013; that is up to the democratically elected leader of your country, President Zelensky. With regard to your energy situation, that is something that we also strongly support in terms of your ability to defend yourself against Russian missiles and drones, but also to repair and protect the energy infrastructure. We are going to continue in that regard to do everything possible to support your preparations for this winter. We have spent $324 million this spring to put about three gigawatts back into your grid. We have another $825 million that we are spending to do many aspects of repair, protection, and assistance to distribution. So we&apos;re going to continue in that way. What I would say about this is that strong corporate governance that is done according to OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) standards is vital for donor confidence and private sector investment, which is what Ukraine needs for its recovery. The Kyiv Independent: Just to clarify, do you mean that the firing of Kudrytskyi was potentially a threat to proper corporate governance? Ambassador Brink: I don&apos;t want to comment on the specifics of how it happened, but I can say that a strong adherence to international standards &#x2014; that means OECD standards in corporate governance in SOEs (state-owned enterprises), especially SOEs like Ukrenergo and other energy SOEs &#x2014; is vitally important to your future.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ambassador-brink-we-have-some-sense-of-contours-of-zelenskys-victory-plan/	2024-09-19T12:38:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2152422190.jpg
Georgian leader's 'apology' for 2008 war could be a win for Russia, experts say	The de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party stunned Georgians &#x2014; who are rarely shocked by the turbulent political situation in the country &#x2014; by declaring that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s statement on Sept. 14 was a campaign promise made ahead of the upcoming October parliamentary election, and part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia. But according to analysts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the suggestion that Georgia, rather than Russia, is at fault for the war may be a step too far and is unlikely to have a positive electoral impact for the Georgian Dream. &quot;This statement is not going to make the Georgian Dream any more popular with its constituents, those who already like them will vote for them no matter what, and those who are undecided, I think they will, for lack of a better term, be turned off by this statement,&quot; said Tinatin Japaridze, a risk analyst at the Eurasia Group. &quot;It&apos;s a lose-lose for Tbilisi, but a definite gain for Moscow because it is able to distance itself from taking responsibility for (the 2008 war),&quot; Japaridze told the Kyiv Independent. The five-day war in 2008, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, the displacement of almost 130,000 people, and cemented the Russian occupation of around 20% of the country, has long been a hot-button political issue for Georgia. While Ivanishvili&apos;s suggestion that Georgia should apologize to Ossetians, the minority ethnic group that predominantly lives in the South Ossetia region occupied by Russia, was the strongest statement to date, it was not the first time that Ivanishvili or other officials have blamed their own country for the Russian invasion of sovereign Georgian territory. The roots of the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia stretch back to Soviet times when an autonomous region for Ossetians was created after the Red Army took over Georgia in the 1920s and established communist rule. Across the border, in then Soviet Russia lay the North Ossetia autonomous region, where the bulk of ethnic Ossetians lived. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Georgia, the majority of Ossetians were spread across the Russian North Ossetia, and the Georgian South Ossetia, now across an international border. An ethnic conflict, inflamed and supported by Moscow, soon arose, resulting after the war&apos;s end in 1992 with divided control between Tbilisi and South Ossetian separatists in the region. An unclear situation in South Ossetia remained in place until 2008 by which point Russia had given passports to a majority of the population. Relations between the strongly pro-Western Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili (2004-2013) and Russia had deteriorated. Moscow began further fanning the flames of separatism and claiming that Georgia was planning a genocide of Ossetians. Militant groups in South Ossetia began firing on Georgian positions, and ultimately, Saakashvili decided to send troops into the breakaway region.

(Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images)In response, under the guise of protecting Ossetians, Russia sent its own military into the area, resulting in the five-day war and the subsequent Russian occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another region of Georgia where Russian-backed separatists had fought a war with Tbilisi in the 1990s. During the war, Russian troops went far past the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#x2014; both internationally recognized as sovereign Georgian territory &#x2014; and drove armored columns just dozens of miles from Tbilisi. According to the Georgian Foreign Ministry, 224 Georgian civilians and 161 soldiers were killed during the war. The war has been hotly debated across Georgia, Russia, and the West. Countless explanations have been given for how it started, who set it off, and who should be blamed. A report by the Council of the European Union issued in 2009 claimed that Georgia was responsible for the war because it had set off hostilities through its shelling of the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali. The report said the Georgian attack was &quot;unjustifiable&quot; but also acknowledged that Russia went far beyond defending its own servicemen and Ossetian citizens and that the incursion past South Ossetia was &quot;in violation of international law.&quot; The report was criticized at the time for being overly deferential to Russia, a charge that has only increased since. The European Council on Foreign Relations said in 2015 that the report had been influenced by Russian propaganda, and other think tanks like the Atlantic Council said that Russia was unequivocally to blame. The European Court on Human Rights ruled in 2021 that Russia was responsible for a wide variety of human rights violations in the war. The war has continued to be rethought and analyzed after Russia&apos;s military aggression against Ukraine, with many leaders and experts saying the international community&apos;s lack of proper response then gave the green light for Russia to later invade Ukraine. But within Georgia, the war has become a political weapon, often employed by the Georgian Dream to smear Saakashvili &#x2013; imprisoned since 2021 on charges he claims are trumped up by rivals &#x2013; and his party, the United National Movement (UNM).

(Andrei Smirnov / AFP via Getty Images)Ivanishvili and other officials have called Saakashvili and UNM &quot;criminal&quot; for starting the war, and have warned that their return to power (or any opposition party) would lead to renewed conflict with Russia. &quot;If one believes, like I do, that Ivanishvili has always been the Kremlin&apos;s instrument, with a task to bring Georgia back into Russian domination, then his current behavior can only be seen as the last steps of this plan,&quot; said David Zedelashvili, a constitutional lawyer and professor in Georgia. In his statement about the need to apologize to Ossetians, Ivanishvili said: &quot;Immediately after the Oct. 26 elections, those who instigated the war will face justice.&quot; Tina Bokuchava, chair of UNM, said the remarks were &quot;one of the most shameful, disgusting, treacherous statements,&quot; a sentiment that was echoed by other opposition politicians. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in August that the Georgian Dream would seek a constitutional ban of UNM and its affiliates if it secured a constitutional majority in the election. Many viewed the pledge as a plan to ban all opposition parties. The wrangling over history is the latest step in Georgia&apos;s heated political environment as the country prepares for a decisive election in October. In the meantime, Georgia&apos;s relations with the West have fallen to a low point, particularly over concerns about the controversial foreign agents law passed earlier in the year. The EU has frozen Georgia&apos;s path toward accession to the bloc, and both the EU and the U.S. have halted aid packages, citing fears of democratic backsliding in the country. Some in Georgia believe that Ivanishvili&apos;s statement, given the wider context of warming relations with Moscow, is setting the stage for a possible deal with Russia that could see the reintegration of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Georgia in the form of a confederation.

( Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)While Georgians across the board would be thrilled to see the return of the occupied territories, there is a widespread belief that such a plan as currently formulated would be a poison pill that ensures their reintegration on the Kremlin&apos;s terms. &quot;I think there&apos;s a lot of skepticism that Georgia can get the territories back anytime soon, whether it&apos;s under the opposition that may come to power or under the current ruling party,&quot; said Japaridze. &quot;It&apos;s a pie in the sky that the Georgian Dream is going to try to use.&quot; The kind of concessions required to achieve reintegration with the consent of the Kremlin are unknown, and there are signs that Russian-backed authorities in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not interested in such a deal. &quot;I don&apos;t think that Russia will even allow the project of confederation,&quot; Zedalishvili told the Kyiv Independent. South Ossetian officials said the apology should be viewed in the context of domestic electoral politics, and added that &quot;Tskhinvali expects not only verbal declarations but also practical steps&quot; on key issues to move forward with any rapprochement. The United National Movement (UNM) and Saakashvili are somewhat controversial in Georgia, opinion polls have found that a higher percentage of respondents said human rights abuses were the largest failure of the Saakashvili regime (27%). Failure to prevent the war came in second place, at 25%. At the same time, a slight majority (55%) disagreed that the government did everything possible to stop the war from happening.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Numerous surveys have found that an overwhelming majority of Georgians still believe that Russia is the primary threat facing the country. Only 3% of respondents said they wanted a pro-Russia government, according to a 2023 poll. At the same time, a plurality of respondents, including those who support opposition parties, said that Georgia&apos;s foreign policy should be &quot;pro-Western, however we should maintain good relations with Russia.&quot; The Kremlin certainly wants to maintain influence over Georgia, but it does not hold political developments there to the same level of importance as in Ukraine, Japaridze said. &quot;As long as (the Kremlin&apos;s) interests are not being challenged, and ideally, they are being represented by whoever is in the Georgian government as the ruling party, Moscow is okay,&quot; Japaridze said. &quot;I don&apos;t think that they are going to necessarily try to invade Georgia or try to annex Georgia. &quot;I don&apos;t think they need to do that, as long as it&apos;s within (the Kremlin&apos;s) fold,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/shameful-georgia-leaders-apology-for-2008-war-could-be-a-win-for-russia-experts-say/	2024-09-19T12:21:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-543778136.jpg
Bulgaria to ask EU to suspend egg imports from Ukraine	Bulgaria will request the suspension of egg imports from Ukraine at a meeting of the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on Sept. 23, Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Georgi Takhov said on Sept. 19. The statement comes as a sign of persisting disputes between Ukraine and eastern EU members over agricultural trade. The quarrels boiled over into border blockades on the Ukrainian-Polish border in late 2023 and early 2024, import bans on Ukrainian commodities like corn and wheat, and farmers&apos; protests in Poland, Bulgaria, and elsewhere. According to Takhov, Bulgarian producers are facing difficulties due to the growth of imports, which, in their opinion, hinders competition in the domestic market, Bulgarian 24 Chasa news outlet reported. The Bulgarian minister did not rule out the introduction of &quot;protective measures&quot; to limit trade with Ukraine. &quot;When the import of a certain type of product or commodity &#x2014; vegetables, meat, eggs &#x2014; reaches certain limits that the European Commission has outlined in advance, then we can activate the mechanism of banning their import. We are currently doing this in terms of eggs,&quot; Takhov said. The updated rules of duty-free and quota-free trade in agricultural products between Ukraine and the EU came into force on June 6. The new free-trade scheme incorporates an automatic safeguard mechanism designed to protect specific domestic sectors deemed &apos;sensitive&apos;&#x2014;including eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, hulled grains, and honey&#x2014;from a surge in imports due to the lifting of quotas and tariffs. This allows the European Commission to activate the so-called emergency brake and reintroduce tariff-rate quotas if imports of these commodities surpass the average quantities imported between July 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2023. Ukrainian agricultural imports into the EU surged in 2022 after the outbreak of the full-scale war. The European bloc lifted tariffs on Ukrainian goods after the invasion&apos;s start to alleviate the country&apos;s economy amid Russian attacks and the blockade of the Black Sea trade routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgaria-to-ask-eu-to-suspend-eggs-imports-from-ukraine/	2024-09-19T12:06:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239485218.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian airstrike on Sumy retirement home kills 1, injures 14	Key developments on Sept. 19: Russian forces attacked a retirement home in the city of Sumy with a guided aerial bomb on Sept. 19, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others, regional officials said. A total of 221 elderly people lived in the retirement home, according to Kalchenko. The attack partially destroyed two floors of the building, the Interior Ministry said. There are no people trapped under the rubble. A total of 147 people have been evacuated.

(Eugene Abrasimov/Suspilne Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;People are being moved to new prepared places. They need medical and psychological assistance,&quot; Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said on national television. &quot;It (the attack) happened in the afternoon. People were having lunch or resting and were shocked.&quot; Russia has intensified its attacks on bordering Sumy Oblast, which the military considers to be a response to Kyiv&apos;s success in the Kursk operation that was launched in early August. Ukrainian authorities are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from the region. Moscow has moved about 40,000 Russian soldiers to embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 19. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Zelensky&apos;s latest figure of Russian soldiers redeployed to Kursk Oblast is lower than the one announced in early September, where he put their number at 60,000. &quot;We have also replenished our exchange fund,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;All of this is important and affects the general situation in the war.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s president said that Ukrainian soldiers managed to scale down Russia&apos;s &quot;assault potential&quot; in Donetsk Oblast, but described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; Fierce fighting is ongoing in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors. The European Parliament passed a resolution on Sept. 19 calling for EU member states to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of Western-supplied weapons inside Russia and accelerate weapons deliveries, &quot;including Taurus missiles.&quot; While Kyiv has received long-range missiles from partners like the U.S., the U.K., and France, Ukrainian forces are restricted from using the weapons to hit deep inside Russian territory. Germany has held back entirely on delivering long-range Taurus missiles, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz repeatedly citing a fear of escalation. &quot;Without lifting current restrictions, Ukraine cannot fully exercise its right to self-defense and remains exposed to attacks on its population and infrastructure,&quot; the European Parliament&apos;s resolution said. The text also called for member states &quot;to accelerate the delivery of weapons, air defense systems, and ammunition, including Taurus missiles.&quot; The resolution additionally called for EU states to &quot;maintain and extend the Council&#x2019;s sanctions policy against Russia, Belarus, and non-EU countries and entities providing Russia with military and dual-use technologies.&quot; The motion was passed with 425 votes in favor, 131 against, and 63 abstentions. Russia is placing explosives at dams in its own Belgorod Oblast, possibly to stage provocations and accuse Ukraine of causing environmental damage, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv group of forces said on Sept. 19. Belgorod, lying only some 25 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, is one of the Russian cities most directly impacted by Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. The city has come under numerous strikes, and ground clashes have taken place in Belgorod Oblast, most recently as part of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursions ongoing since early August. Military spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said that Russia is not only fortifying the Belgorod area but also mining dams, a move that can serve various purposes in the future. &quot;If the situation changes dramatically, Russia may blow up the dams to slow the advance of Ukrainian forces,&quot; Sarantsev suggested. &quot;We can also assume that Russia is preparing provocations at the dams to blame Ukraine for environmental and humanitarian consequences.&quot; This can be used to mobilize the population and divert attention from internal problems, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Sarantsev did not mention any specific dams in the statement quoted by the Kharkiv group of forces. In Belgorod Oblast, there are 1,100 ponds and four artificial water reservoirs, including the Belgorod reservoir south of the city, covering an area of over 2,500 square kilometers (960 square miles). Berlin has handed over 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks, 61,000 155 mm rounds of ammunition, three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns with spare parts, and other equipment in its latest delivery of military aid to Ukraine, the German government said on Sept. 19. The tranche also included five Bandvagn 206 all-terrain vehicles, two air surveillance TRML-4D radars, and an all-terrain tracked carrier Warthog, as well as 112 vehicles from Bundeswehr and industry stocks. Ukraine received 30 Vector drones, 20 Heidrun RQ-35 reconnaissance drones, 12 Songbird drones, six Hornet XR drones, and 20 naval drones. Berlin further delivered three Beaver bridge-laying tanks with spare parts, a Dachs armored engineer vehicle with spare parts, and six Wisent 1 mine-clearing tanks. The 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks with spare parts were delivered under a joint initiative with Denmark.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-30/	2024-09-19T11:46:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173160847.jpg

Last week, Russia launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, which was halted on Sept. 18, according to the Ukrainian military. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine, primarily from the Pokrovsk sector. In addition to pushing Russian troops away from the border, Ukraine has reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Russia&apos;s region as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-redeploys-40-000-troops-to-kursk-oblast-amid-ongoing-kyivs-incursion-zelensky-says/	2024-09-19T11:06:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172545405.jpg
Zelensky to meet Biden, Harris in White House on Sept. 26	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the White House on Sept. 26 to discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine with U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. &quot;The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Zelensky is heading to the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Biden, who sat in the White House throughout the full-scale war and played a key role in building the pro-Kyiv coalition, will leave office next January. While positioning Washington as Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor, the Biden administration has attracted criticism over its careful and piecemeal approach to providing aid. Kyiv has increasingly criticized its partners in recent weeks, saying that despite the $61 billion U.S. aid bill being passed in April, the assistance is trickling down too slowly and is not enough to equip even &quot;four out of the 14 brigades&quot; the country is mustering. Ukraine is also still expecting a decision on long-range strikes in Russia with Western arms, something that Washington has been reluctant to approve. Early next year, Biden will pass over the keys from the White House either to Democratic candidate Harris or her Republican challenger, Donald Trump. Former President Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet with Zelensky next week, as the Ukrainian leader said he wants to present the victory plan to him as well. Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The ex-president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-biden-harris-in-white-house-on-sept-26/	2024-09-19T11:01:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161010459.jpg
EU aims to cover 25% of Ukraine's energy needs in winter, von der Leyen says ahead of Kyiv visit	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Kyiv on Sept. 20 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky, she said on Sept. 19. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels alongside International Energy Agency director Fatih Birol, von der Leyen said Russia &quot;is trying to plunge the country into dark&quot; as it destroyed 80% of Ukraine&apos;s thermal power plants and one-third of its hydroelectric capacity. Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 19 that he is expecting &quot;important talks&quot; with von der Leyen in Kyiv regarding the energy situation. Moscow has pounded Ukrainian energy infrastructure in numerous aerial strikes throughout the full-scale war, with the largest one being carried out on Aug. 26 with the use of over 230 missiles and drones. &quot;As Ukraine&apos;s friends and partners, we must do all we can to keep the lights on,&quot; von der Leyen said. The EU executive arm&apos;s chief noted that Ukraine needs 17 gigawatts of power capacity for this winter and named three main vectors of the EU&apos;s energy assistance for the war-torn country. These steps should cover around 4.5 gigawatts of capacity, which is roughly 25% of Ukraine&apos;s winter needs, von der Leyen said. In the first step, the EU will assist Ukraine with repairing its energy infrastructure with the aim of restoring 2.5 gigawatts of capacity. &quot;As we speak, there is a full thermal power plant that is being dismantled in Lithuania and shipped piece by piece to Ukraine with our support,&quot; the EU official said. The EU will also continue exporting electricity to Ukraine and improving energy connectivity. The bloc will supply 2 gigawatts of electricity this way, which is equivalent to the loss of power from the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, according to von der Leyen. As the third point, the EU will boost decentralized and renewable production to stabilize the electricity flow in the country. The EU will support Ukraine with 160 million euros ($178 million) ahead of winter to improve the country&apos;s resilience to Russian strikes, von der Leyen announced earlier today. Around 60 million euros ($67 million) of the EU aid will go toward humanitarian aid such as shelters and heaters. 100 million euros ($111 million) will be spent on repairing energy infrastructure and developing renewable energy. Speaking alongside von der Leyen, IEA chief Birol presented a 10-step action plan to help the country tackle the winter, which he said may be the &quot;sternest one yet.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-to-visit-kyiv/	2024-09-19T10:21:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1662120631.jpeg
Russia mining dams in Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine's military claims	Russia is placing explosives at dams in its own Belgorod Oblast, possibly to stage provocations and accuse Ukraine of causing environmental damage, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv group of forces said on Sept. 19. Belgorod, lying only some 25 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, is one of the Russian cities most directly impacted by Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. The city has come under numerous strikes, and ground clashes have taken place in Belgorod Oblast, most recently as part of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursions ongoing since early August. Military spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said that Russia is not only fortifying the Belgorod area but also mining dams, a move that can serve various purposes in the future. &quot;If the situation changes dramatically, Russia may blow up the dams to slow the advance of Ukrainian forces,&quot; Sarantsev suggested. &quot;We can also assume that Russia is preparing provocations at the dams to blame Ukraine for environmental and humanitarian consequences.&quot; This can be used to mobilize the population and divert attention from internal problems, he added. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Sarantsev did not mention any specific dams in the statement quoted by the Kharkiv group of forces. In Belgorod Oblast, there are 1,100 ponds and four artificial water reservoirs, including the Belgorod reservoir south of the city, covering an area of over 2,500 square kilometers (960 square miles). Russia destroyed the occupied Kakhovka dam in Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast in June 2023, unleashing massive floods and an environmental and humanitarian disaster across southern Ukraine. Russian forces also damaged the dams and the adjacent hydroelectric power plants in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia during mass aerial attacks against energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-mining-dams-in-belgorod-oblast-kyiv-says/	2024-09-19T09:24:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1258244285.jpg
Russia aims to increase drone production tenfold in 2024, Putin claims	Russia is planning to increase drone production &quot;almost ten times&quot; this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Sept. 19, Kremlin-controlled Interfax news agency reported. In 2023, the Russian army received about 140,000 drones of different types, according to Putin. This year, Moscow wants to produce 1.4 million, Putin said. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines. &quot;The key task is to produce a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles, to establish mass production of such promising equipment as quickly as possible,&quot; the Russian president said at a meeting with Russia&apos;s military-industrial commission. &quot;Along with the development of drones, we also need to examine ways to destroy them with electronic warfare and conventional means.&quot; Moscow wants to design, test, and produce drones using Russian special research and production centers. Russia is also developing naval drones, Putin claimed. Russia has widely deployed drone capabilities during the war, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukraine has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, with 1 million drones contracted by Ukrainian manufacturers through 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-aims-to-increase-drone-production-tenfold-putin-claims/	2024-09-19T09:18:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170784701.jpg
Ukraine's victory delayed by West's fears of Russian defeat, Canadian-Ukrainian lawyer turned soldier says	Daniel Bilak is a Canadian-Ukrainian lawyer living in Ukraine for decades, taking on critical roles in what has been a rollercoaster career amidst Ukraine&apos;s fight to prosper while defending its freedom. He has played a big role in attracting investment into the country, first as a lawyer and later, from 2016 to 2019, as chief investment advisor to Ukraine&apos;s prime minister and head of the government&apos;s UkraineInvest agency. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022, Bilak joined Ukraine&apos;s Territorial Defense Forces and is now part of a unit that protects Kyiv&apos;s skies from Russian drones and missiles. As a partner at the Kyiv offices of Kinstellar, Bilak simultaneously continues work as a lawyer. Kinstellar has advised German defense industry giant Rheinmetall on forging a cooperation agreement with Ukraine&apos;s state-owned arms concern Ukroboronprom that involves joint maintenance of military equipment provided by Germany, as well as the future &quot;transfer of technology, (and) joint production of selected Rheinmetall products in Ukraine.&quot; While still Ukraine&apos;s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov issued an award to Bilak recognizing his work &quot;For Support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&quot; The Kyiv Independent interviewed Bilak, asking the lawyer-turned-soldier about how the West sees Ukraine, why it takes so much time to receive the required arms and military technology, and how safe it is for companies, including military ones, to invest in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: There are discussions in the West that people are getting tired of helping Ukraine. What would you say to those who feel this way? Daniel Bilak: These people who say they&apos;re tired of Ukraine have never faced an enemy like the one that we are facing. The gruesome brutality of a genocidal colonial empire is an awesome thing to behold. It&apos;s absolutely astounding that we have held them off. We&apos;ve been supported by our allies, but not enough. And this is the biggest problem that the West and democracies have &#x2013; understanding that Ukraine is at the epicenter of global change, but also the epicenter of global security. What happens here is going to determine what happens in other places, in the Middle East, in Taiwan, in Southeast Asia, and in Africa. Because if we have dictators running around unhinged, unfettered, and completely without any sort of accountability for their actions &#x2026; we will see the end of the international world order. We&apos;re repeating all of that, this soft appeasement. I mean, the Poles of all people, the Latvians, the Romanians are afraid to shoot down Russian Shahed (Iranian drones provided to Russia) that invade their airspace. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s great strategic victory to this point has been getting inside the heads of U.S. President Joe Biden and Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, especially. There are others that he has forced to self-deter. For six months, we basically held them off by ourselves at enormous cost when the Americans and our other allies were not funding us. We were begging for anti-missile systems to at least close the skies over Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Odesa, which were being just pulverized. Seven Patriot missile systems we asked for out of a hundred that are in Europe, and nobody gave us anything. The burning 12-story residential building hit by Russian forces on Aug. 30, 2024, in Kharkiv, Ukraine. (Governor Oleh Syniehubov/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent: How do you explain that? Daniel Bilak: The West is really playing with fire in not understanding that its own security, especially the security of the European continent, runs through Ukraine. And unless you stand up to dictators, they will always double down. Putin has gotten inside their heads. He&apos;s got all these red lines, and everybody&apos;s afraid to cross. I mean, this is a guy who hid inside a bunker for two years because he was afraid of a virus. It&apos;s highly unlikely that he&apos;s going to launch a nuclear war. In fact, the heads of the CIA and British MI5 basically said the other day in an interview that he&apos;s just gaming us, and he&apos;s making the Americans and the Germans especially self-deter. It&apos;s not just that they&apos;re afraid of Putin. They&apos;re afraid of the consequences of what happens if Russia loses. They are afraid of us winning. They know we can win this war and defeat the Russians. We drove them out of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson. Had our allies not stopped us, we probably could have won this war by the spring of 2023. But this fear of what happens if Russia loses is basically creating a situation where they&apos;re holding us on a tight leash. It is morally repugnant to have a policy that says we will not allow the Ukrainians to defend themselves by giving them long-range weapons to hit Russian targets inside Russia that are killing Ukrainian citizens. And that is something that the leaders of our allies are going to have to be held accountable for. And there&apos;s no reason for it because of this great fear of some sort of escalation. We crossed all of Putin&apos;s red lines, from HIMARS to battle tanks, to the Black Sea, to other systems. And now we crossed the ultimate red line, which was invading Russia in Kursk. And what was Putin&apos;s response? By invading Kursk, by invading Russia, Ukraine has shown that all of these red lines don&apos;t mean anything. The Kyiv Independent: Why don&apos;t they want Ukraine to win? Daniel Bilak: Because they&apos;re afraid of Russia losing. They&apos;re afraid of the consequences in case Russia collapses. This is the same thing that happened in 1991 when George H. W. Bush came to Kyiv and gave his so-called &apos;chicken Kyiv&apos; speech to warn Ukrainians against suicidal nationalism. &apos;Don&apos;t leave the Soviet Union,&apos; because they were worried about what would happen to the nuclear weapons. Well, in the end, everything worked out. We actually gave up the nuclear weapons that were on our territory and let the Russians keep theirs, and now we have the situation that we&apos;re actually paying for that decision. The Kyiv Independent: Is it safe to invest in Ukraine now? Daniel Bilak: Our firm, Kinstellar, works (on this) very, very deeply &#x2026; the most immediate trend is investing in the defense sector. And that includes large prime contractors, as they&apos;re called. These are global giants &#x2013; Rheinmetall, KNDS, Babcock, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, all of whom are looking to invest in Ukraine. As well as the military technology sector, which is involved, especially in the drone space. It&apos;s very hard for me to even convey what a seismic shift this is in the economy and for the military. When I was at UkraineInvest, I was trying to hive off Antonov from Ukroboronprom, which is now called Ukrainian Defense Industries. It wasn&apos;t even a company &#x2013; the government called it a defense concern, and it had hundreds, if not thousands of companies under it. It was a monopolist. All of that has now changed. And a lot of these big companies are coming into Ukraine now for the first time &#x2013; nobody was ever allowed in before. But now they&apos;re coming in with their investments, their technology, their know-how. And they are doing joint ventures with state-owned enterprises to build a Ukrainian, dynamic economic hub. It&apos;s easier to do defense manufacturing now in Ukraine than in almost any other place in Europe, because we have a very big need for that. Then you have the other side, which is drones. We are advancing technologically. Some British companies told me we&apos;re 30 years ahead of them because our technologies go through iterations and generational changes every three months instead of every three years. And nobody can keep up with this pace of change. And so there are ways for Ukrainian drone companies and drone companies abroad to work together because they need access to our technologies, and we need access to some of their technologies and to their components. We want to swap out the Chinese components and use British, or U.S., or German &#x2013; or from other countries. Photo for illustrative purposes.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)We will become a really essential part of the global supply chains of these military giants down the road. Once the war ends, we will continue to produce military goods, but we will have lots of other things to do. The construction and infrastructure sector is going to be a massive undertaking. We have whole cities to rebuild. Energy sector is also part of it, but we are not going to go back to building massive Soviet hydroelectric or nuclear plants. We may move to small mobile nuclear reactors, or to something smaller for district heating operations. We can&apos;t make these (military) targets of big plants anymore. So the national security aspects are going to become part of the design of the economic aspect of rebuilding Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Let&apos;s talk about the Russian narratives that are spread about Ukraine abroad. Do you think that Ukraine succeeded in messaging to the West about the Russian war against Ukraine? What can be improved? What should change? Daniel Bilak: Russia has been doing disinformation for many years. It is very complicated for Ukrainians to get their message out. I was trying to do that when I was at UkraineInvest, but you have to have people willing to listen. And unfortunately, Russia has &apos;useful idiots&apos; in the media in the West, or paid agents. These echo chambers have a positive view of Russia and a negative view of Ukraine. And it&apos;s very difficult to break that. I think the war started doing that, but we still see the reporting in many Western newspapers as being sort of slanted towards &apos;Russia&apos;s so much bigger and it&apos;s so much stronger.&apos; And none of that has any basis in reality on the ground, but it&apos;s a matter of the perceptions. And once those public perceptions are formed and they&apos;re in the heads of policymakers, media, and the general public, it&apos;s really hard to break. There has been some great reporting in the United States and in other countries about what&apos;s happening in Ukraine and how resilient we are. Russia&apos;s preparing for a war with NATO. And I think that NATO countries are starting to understand that. The chiefs of the defense staff of many NATO countries have spoken about this. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg talked about this. Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech at the meeting in Zaryadye Hall, marking the City Day in Moscow, Russia Sep. 7, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)Everybody knows that within 3, or 5, or 7 years, there could be a major war with Russia if the Ukraine issue isn&apos;t solved. And Russia knows it&apos;s not ready to fight NATO militarily. So what it&apos;s trying to do is undermine the faith of people, of citizens in democratic countries, in the legitimacy of their institutions &#x2013; that there is no truth, that there is nothing you can really do. (Russia is) creating fake websites and NGOs that then fund extremist groups. It&apos;s a very, very sophisticated disinformation campaign, plus sabotage. The only way you can deal with it is, to tell the truth, but you need influencers to tell the truth or to point out the facts, just as the United States did with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and is still doing with other Russia plans to create false flag operations. The Kyiv Independent: If there&apos;s one Russian narrative that is the most dangerous at the moment that has been spread around, what is it? Daniel Bilak: The Russian idea that Ukraine has no hope of winning, and the West should stop supporting it because it&apos;s a waste of time. &apos;Get them to the table and capitulate.&apos;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-delayed-by-wests-fears-of-russian-defeat-canadian-ukrainian-lawyer-turned-soldier-says/	2024-09-19T09:18:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd.jpg
Ukrainian drones are burning Russia’s oil refineries, but not its economy	Ukraine&#x2019;s drone attacks on Russian oil refineries are trying to achieve what Western sanctions couldn&#x2019;t: grinding down what fuels Russia&#x2019;s war machine and the backbone of its economy in an echo of the Allies&apos; oil bombing campaign on German assets in World War II. Since the start of the year, Ukrainian drones have hit around 33 oil assets, mostly refineries, in Russia, OSINT group Liveuamap told the Kyiv Independent. Although Kyiv has not confirmed the exact number, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in June that over 30 oil targets have been hit, some in regions bordering Ukraine near Russian military staging areas and others as deep as 1,500 kilometers into Russia. Oil refineries, which turn crude oil into products like gasoline and diesel, are the Kremlin&#x2019;s cash cow. Just last month, Russia earned an estimated $520 million per day from crude exports and oil product sea exports, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). An infographic showing the locations of Ukraine&apos;s attack on Russian oil assets in 2024. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The viral videos of drones slamming into refineries have boosted morale in Ukraine and undermined the Kremlin. However, the tangible impact may not be as great as Ukraine initially hoped. While oil companies have likely spent tens of millions of dollars repairing facilities, it&#x2019;s a drop in the ocean compared to their multibillion-dollar turnover. While Ukraine&#x2019;s campaign has significantly diminished the volume of Russia&#x2019;s oil refining, &#x201C;this has not had a strategic effect on Russia,&#x201D; a Western official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. &quot;These strikes are primarily aimed at fuel refining installations that are supporting Russian front-line forces rather than the economy as a whole.&#x201D; Ukrainian drones can fly greater distances than ever before, putting over half of Russia&#x2019;s total refining capability in the firing line, which totals around 3.7 million barrels per day, according to a report from the U.K.-based Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES). Russia claims the strikes make little difference, saying last week that it has improved its air defense. However, the oil sector has classified its production and output data, hinting that the situation could be worse than they are letting on, according to Talya Vatman, Russia, Caspian, and Black Sea Programme Manager at the International Energy Agency (IEA). Alleged footage of a burning oil terminal in Smolensk Oblast, Russia, on April 24, 2024. (Open sources/X).A fire in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast on June 20, 2024, after a reported Ukrainian drone strike against an oil depot. (Open sources/Telegram).&#x201C;While all statements from Russian oil companies and the Kremlin are in lockstep, saying that there is no impact, this decision looks like a strategic one that could imply that production has been hit,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent. According to Vatman, the strike on Sept. 1 at Gazprom Neft&#x2019;s Moscow oil refinery will &#x201C;significantly&#x201D; impede its production capability after a blaze at the Euro+ refining unit forced operations to shut down. While the campaign has not altered global prices for oil products, Vatman said the attacks could bruise the reliability of Russian oil product imports. In response, traders may turn away from Russia and look for alternative, more stable sources. But traders that continue to import cheap Russian crude and oil products are likely &#x201C;not afraid of the volatility and risks,&#x201D; according to Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and former head of strategy and innovations at Gazprom Neft. He noted that the effects of the attacks were strongest following a heavy drone campaign by Ukraine in March that targeted 14 refineries. Gasoline production dropped from 850,000 metric tons per month to 770,000 metric tons in April and May, according to CREA. By July, Russia&apos;s oil refining had reduced by around 17%, a NATO official told reporters. Russia has since bounced back from the March attacks and sea exports have steadily risen since May. They are still below the levels in the first four months of the year, likely due to OPEC+ restrictions in summer and an extended government ban on gasoline exports until the end of the year. &#x201C;This measure has been taken in the past when the domestic gasoline supply-demand balance has been very tight, and authorities are worried about prices on the domestic market going up,&quot; Vatman said. An infographics of Russian&apos;s oil export revenue. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)While sea export volumes have improved, their revenues dropped by 7% month-on-month in August, according to CREA. But the declining revenues are less likely to do with the attacks and more down to sliding global oil prices, according to Vakulenko. Ultimately, Russia&#x2019;s oil sector is too big to feel a substantial impact from drone attacks, Vakulenko wrote in a Carnegie report. While drones are cost-effective, they can only carry payloads between 5&#x2013;50 kilograms; enough to impair sensitive parts of the refineries, like distillation towers, but not enough to wipe it out completely. The situation could change if the West allows Ukraine to use Western-made long-range missiles on Russian territory. Missiles can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives, inflicting far more damage, Vakulenko said. Although they are unlikely to be able to destroy multiple oil refinery installations at once, he added. Moreover, missiles are pricey, with each one costing over $1 million, and Ukraine is unlikely to use them on assets like oil refineries as it could also be &#x201C;politically problematic with the West,&#x201D; Sascha Bruchmann, a visiting fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), told the Kyiv Independent. But missiles could wreck Russia&#x2019;s air defense systems, forcing Russia to relocate the remaining systems away from oil assets and closer to the frontline, he added. This may pave the wave for fleets of drones with higher payloads to penetrate Russia&#x2019;s airspace undetected, he said. &#x201C;Missiles and drones reinforce each other and give commanders more flexibility,&#x201D; he said. So far, the attacks have largely concentrated on oil refining rather than exploration and production assets. Ukrainian drones have also hit Russia&#x2019;s electricity infrastructure, which could also be a target for long-range missiles to cut off Russia&#x2019;s military and defense industries. Even if Ukraine manages to take out all the refineries within its reach, Vakulenko says Russia can still cover its military, domestic, and economic needs and could turn to neighboring Belarus to recuperate the losses.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)This does not mean Russia&#x2019;s oil industry is in the clear. Western embargos are beginning to bite, leading to longer export distances and higher transport costs for Russian companies which depletes their profits and subsequently taxes for Russia&#x2019;s state budget, Petras Katinas, Energy Analyst at CREA, told the Kyiv Independent. Sanctions are also hindering Russian oil companies&apos; ability to modernize and update their IT systems, which rely on Western technologies. Companies could face operational difficulties and lower inefficiency without access to replacements or updates, causing disruptions in refining and production capabilities, Katinas predicts. Moscow is also battling with oil companies that are surreptitiously seeking higher profits, Katinas claims. Certain companies are buying gasoline at lower domestic rates and reselling it abroad for more, driving up domestic demand and prices. Prioritizing premium markets, like China, India, and Turkey, gives higher returns to companies but &#x201C;undermines the government&#x2019;s strategy to balance domestic needs with international market pressures,&#x201D; Katinas said. &#x201C;While a complete collapse of the Russian oil sector is unlikely in the short term, it does face substantial risks and challenges that could lead to long-term decline,&#x201D; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-are-burning-russias-oil-refineries-but-not-its-economy/	2024-09-19T09:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
With few easy options, Ukraine votes to raise taxes on stressed citizens	Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament voted to approve a tax hike for the first time since the full-scale war broke out, turning to a politically unpopular move as the country continually struggles to find new sources of funding for its growing wartime budget. The bill passed in parliament as part of a plan to fund a newly approved Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) defense spending increase for the year. The country is facing a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and as Russia&#x2019;s war continues in its third year with no end in sight, the country needs to find funding to keep its economy afloat and finance its war effort. &#x201C;(Raising taxes) was put off to the last possible moment, when it really became obvious that if we do not collect this money, we will not have money to pay salaries to service people,&#x201D; Yuri Gaidai, senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy (CES), told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There aren&#x2019;t many similar situations in history when a country in a war of such scale doesn&apos;t raise taxes,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but there is an unwillingness (in the government) to make unpopular decisions.&#x201D; The tax hike will fund around Hr 60.2 billion ($1.45 billion) in 2024 and Hr 122 billion ($2.94 billion) in 2025, according to the Finance Ministry. The majority of the $12 billion defense budget increase will be financed through issuing domestic government bonds and reduced expenses from refinancing existing state debt. The tax law still needs to pass a second reading, which is not expected until next month, and then it will need to be signed by the president. &#x201C;The Government of Ukraine has already exhausted all possibilities to quickly meet the additional needs of the military state budget without revising taxes,&#x201D; the Finance Ministry told the Kyiv Independent in a statement. &#x201C;The Finance Minister and his deputies held dozens of meetings with representatives of leading Ukrainian economic and financial organizations, as well as analytical centers and associations from various sectors of the economy. All the participants in the discussions expressed their understanding of the importance and necessity of the prompt search for resources to meet the additional needs of the security and defense sector,&#x201D; the statement read.

(Roman Pilipey /AFP via Getty Images)The bill will increase the added military tax from 1.5% to 5%, set higher taxes for self-employed people, retroactively double taxes on bank profits in 2024 to 50%, and raise taxes on the profits of other financial institutions to 25%, among other changes. The increased tax on bank profits was not originally included in a draft of the bill that failed to pass earlier in the month but was expected by many after Ukraine&#x2019;s banks made record profits in 2024 and after a similar retroactive hike was carried out in December 2023 for profits that year. In August, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, with $20 billion expected to be covered by the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility program and by assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The remaining $15 billion needs to be sourced from partners or domestically. The government has moved to raise taxes despite significant pushback from Ukrainian businesses, who argued the burden was unfairly placed on law-abiding businesses and that the government should do more to boost revenues from tax dodgers first. Several prominent business leaders spoke out against the move when it was proposed over the summer. &#xA0;In a July statement, the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said that the proposed tax hike discriminates against &#x201C;bonafide transparent taxpayers,&#x201D; adding that &#x201C;losses from the illicit markets of excisable goods over the last year alone exceed $1 billion.&#x201D; &#x201C;All efforts must be made to ensure that individuals and legal entities operating in Ukraine pay their fair share of taxes in effect today,&#x201D; the chamber said. Raising taxes was a &#x201C;necessary and unavoidable decision,&#x201D; said Gaidai of CES. &#x201C;But in my opinion, this is not the best tax increase design possible, because it puts all the burden on those who already pay their fair share of taxes.&#x201D; Even prior to the tax hike, Ukrainian men were increasingly avoiding official employment over fears of mobilization, moving into &#x201C;grey&#x201D; markets, or ceasing work altogether where they are harder to track by conscription officers. The burden of the new law falls disproportionately on those who have continued operating above board. Separately, the decision to raise bank profit taxes was made over the objections of Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank, which noted that banks were already taxed higher than any other sector of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. &#x201C;We do not support the reapplying of the 50% income tax rate for banks this year,&#x201D; said Andrii Pyshnyi, head of the National Bank of Ukraine, during the bank&#x2019;s monthly press briefing on Sept. 19. A customer at a foreign currency exchange kiosk at night in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 18, 2023. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;Unfortunately, we see that the risks and harms of this decision may actually outweigh the fiscal effect,&#x201D; he said, noting that the central bank already restricts bank profit distribution. &#x201C;All the profit of the banking system remains in the system and works for capital growth. Capital, accordingly, creates additional opportunities for credit support of Ukrainian business.&#x201D; Pyshnyi said the bank is planning to discuss this with the Finance Ministry prior to the law&#x2019;s second reading. Facing pressure to take action on illegal markets, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament also passed a new law to reform the customs service. Major business associations in Ukraine had championed the bill. However, the change is not expected to increase budget revenues any time soon, because of the time needed to implement the reforms, which include a competitive process to select an independent leader and help with vetting from international partners. &#x201C;I would say that this situation with the budget was one of the political enablers for this reform to actually be voted on. Because there is huge pressure from people and from businesses to actually not only raise tax rates but to work on more even tax compliance and on leveling the field,&#x201D; said Gaidai.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-few-easy-options-ukraine-votes-to-raise-taxes-on-its-stressed-citizens/	2024-09-19T08:58:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167567610.jpg
An evil axis' — JP Morgan CEO issues stark economic warning over Russia, Iran, North Korea	JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said people should be less focused on recent U.S. economic news, and instead worry about what he described as &quot;an axis of evil&quot; that could &quot;affect the free and Democratic world for the next 100 years.&quot; Speaking at the 2024 Financial Markets Quality Conference in Washington D.C. on Sept. 17, Dimon pointed to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine in answering questions about the first U.S. central bank interest cut in four years, and its potential impact on the global economy. &quot;The most important thing that dwarfs all other things, that&apos;s really far more important today than it&apos;s been probably since 1945 is the war in Ukraine, what&apos;s going on in Israel, in the Middle East, America&apos;s relations with China, and the attack fundamentally on the rule of law that was set up after World War II,&quot; Dimon, who is regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s top bankers, said. Dimon said that aside from the two world wars, &quot;very few&quot; wars and conflicts dramatically affected the global economy, but said the current global instability was affecting food supplies, migration, and oil supply &quot;and it&apos;s getting worse all the time.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s serious,&quot; Dimon said, adding: &quot;There&apos;s been almost a million casualties in the Ukraine war, something like 20,000 Ukrainian kids have been kidnapped and sent to Russia. &quot;It&apos;s on the border of Europe. There&apos;s the threat of nuclear blackmail,&quot; he added. Russia has consistently issued threats, including nuclear ones, since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But as discussions between Ukraine and its Western allies over possible long-range missile strikes deep inside Russian territory have progressed in recent weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have upped their rhetoric, claiming that such a move would equate to NATO waging war with Moscow. Dimon described &quot;Iran, North Korea and Russia&quot; as an &quot;evil axis who are working every day on how to make it worse for the Western world and for America.&quot; Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks during the 2024 Financial Markets Quality Conference at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024 (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has deepened ties with both North Korea and Iran. Both Kyiv and Washington have previously said that Russia has been using North Korean-produced missiles to attack Ukraine. In March, Ukrainian prosecutors reported that Russia had fired around 50 such missiles to attack six Ukrainian oblasts since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In exchange for the ammunition, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. In late June, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang, where he signed a partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which pledged to provide aid to one another if either will be attacked. More recently, the U.S. confirmed on Sept. 10 that Iran has provided Russia with shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles. Tehran has also provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the all-out war. &quot;This may affect the free and democratic world for the next 100 years,&quot; Dimon said, adding people were &quot;overly focused&quot; on how the interest rate cut would affect markets. &quot;Honestly, most of us have already been through that stuff, it doesn&apos;t matter as much,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s ratcheting up folks and it takes really strong American leadership and Western world leadership to do something about it. That&apos;s my number one concern.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/an-evil-axis-jp-morgan-ceo-issues-stark-economic-warning-over-russia-iran-north-korea/	2024-09-19T08:43:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg
Russian attack on retirement home in Sumy kills at least 1, injures 12	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated.

Moldova's ex-military chief charged with treason over alleged espionage for Russia	Igor Gorgan, the former chief of staff of the Moldovan military, has been charged with treason, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Sept. 19, citing the country&apos;s prosecutors. The Prosecutor&apos;s Office for Combating Organized Crime and Special Cases said that Gorgan stands &quot;accused in the case concerning alleged espionage on behalf of Russia.&quot; The investigative outlet The Insider wrote in June that Gorgan had been an informant of the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) for years. The Moldovan officer served as the chief of the General Staff between 2013 and 2016 and was reappointed to the position in 2019 under pro-Russian President Igor Dodon before losing the position again in 2021 at pro-Western President Maia Sandu&apos;s request. Even after losing office, the general has been using his contacts in the Defense Ministry and has passed sensitive information on Moldova and Ukraine to Russia, The Insider wrote. This reportedly included intelligence on military aid routes from Romania to Ukraine and on the political situation in Moldova. While it is unclear when Gorgan&apos;s alleged cooperation with GRU began, their mutual communication reportedly became particularly active in April 2022, that is, shortly after the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine. Following the media investigation, Moldovan authorities launched a criminal case regarding data transmission related to the national defense system. The prosecutors said the investigation into &quot;the nature and content of the allegedly transmitted information&quot; is ongoing. Gorgan has denied the accusations and called the media investigation fake. Chisinau has been supportive of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and cracked down on Russian subversive operations at home, expelling dozens of diplomats and embassy staff in July 2023 after revelations of espionage activities. Russia&apos;s invasion sparked fears in Moldova of a possible spillover of hostilities, namely via the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovas-ex-military-chief-charged-with-treason/	2024-09-19T08:03:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/Gorgan-2.jpg
Germany delivers over 20 Leopard 1 tanks, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, other aid to Ukraine	Berlin has handed over 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks, 61,000 155 mm rounds of ammunition, three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns with spare parts, and other equipment in its latest delivery of military aid to Ukraine, the German government said on Sept. 19. The tranche also included five Bandvagn 206 all-terrain vehicles, two air surveillance TRML-4D radars, and an all-terrain tracked carrier Warthog, as well as 112 vehicles from Bundeswehr and industry stocks. Ukraine received 30 Vector drones, 20 Heidrun RQ-35 reconnaissance drones, 12 Songbird drones, six Hornet XR drones, and 20 naval drones. Berlin further delivered three Beaver bridge-laying tanks with spare parts, a Dachs armored engineer vehicle with spare parts, and six Wisent 1 mine-clearing tanks. The 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks with spare parts were delivered under a joint initiative with Denmark. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin became Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles. According to an agreed-upon federal budget, Germany&apos;s military aid to Ukraine will be cut by half next year when compared to 2024. Berlin has allocated around 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) to Kyiv in 2024, whereas the next year&apos;s support is currently set at 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion).	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-delivers/	2024-09-19T07:23:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1242704312.jpg
Polish FM reportedly suggests UN mandate and referendum in Crimea	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that Crimea is a key point in any possible peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and suggested &quot;demilitarizing&quot; the peninsula, Interfax-Ukraine reported on Sept. 19, citing the minister&apos;s comments at YES conference in Kyiv. &quot;We could put it under a U.N. mandate with a mission to prepare a fair referendum after establishing who the legal residents are and so on... And we could postpone it for 20 years,&quot; Sikorski suggested as one possible option, according to the news agency. Russia has illegally occupied Crimea since 2014, sparking international condemnations and sanctions. The peninsula remains internationally recognized as Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory. &quot;Crimea is symbolically important for Russia, and especially for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, but strategically important for Ukraine. Therefore, I do not see how they will be able to come to an agreement without demilitarizing Crimea,&quot; Sikorski said. The Polish minister also voiced belief that the West made a mistake when it allegedly told Ukraine not to fight for Crimea in 2014. &quot;If Ukrainians had fought in Crimea, even symbolically, he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would probably not have decided (to attack) Donbas,&quot; Sikorski said. Some of Sikorski&apos;s comments prompted a pushback in Ukraine, namely among the Crimean Tatar community. The Mejlis, the Crimean Tatars&apos; chief executive-representative body, denounced the proposal about Crimea&apos;s status as &quot;unacceptable and cynical.&quot; &quot;Crimea is a temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, and the first step to establishing peace should be the withdrawal of the Russian occupying forces from the territory of the peninsula,&quot; the statement read. The Mejlis also considers any disputes on the &quot;legality&quot; of the peninsula&apos;s residents as &quot;unnecessary and inappropriate.&quot; &quot;According to Ukrainian and international law, Crimea&apos;s &apos;legal residents&apos; are exclusively citizens of Ukraine and persons who have established their permanent or temporary residence in accordance with Ukrainian legislation,&quot; the Mejlis said. Up to 800,000 Russian citizens have illegally settled in Crimea since the start of the occupation in 2014, Ukrainian authorities said last year. Russia&apos;s rule has also been accompanied by systematic repression and persecution of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. &quot;Crimea is Ukraine. Russia has violated international law and must be held accountable for it,&quot; Presidential Office head Andrii Yermak said on his Telegram channel on Sept. 19, without explicitly referencing Sikorski&apos;s comments. Tamila Tasheva, the presidential representative for Crimea, called the minister&apos;s statements &quot;unfortunate, especially in view of the events that have taken place since 2014.&quot; &quot;After the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the inhabitants of the peninsula suffered systematic human rights violations, persecution, and repression,&quot; Tasheva said. &quot;This especially applies to Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians who face discrimination, illegal detentions, and restrictions on freedom of speech and religion.&quot; Ukraine stands firm on its 10-point peace plan that includes the full restoration of territorial integrity, Tasheva said, voicing hope for &quot;further solidarity and support from our international partners in countering aggression and protecting the principles of international law.&quot; While Poland has been a key ally to Ukraine during the full-scale war with Russia, Sikorski&apos;s trip to Kyiv was accompanied by an uneasy atmosphere. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Sikorski on Sept. 13 &quot;was extremely tense; it could even be described as a dispute,&quot; the Polish outlet Onet wrote. The Polish delegation was reportedly taken aback by Zelensky&apos;s tone, who criticized the supposed lack of Warsaw&apos;s support in Ukraine&apos;s EU integration and called for greater military supplies. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also reportedly called out Polish leaders for bringing up the matter of the Volyn massacre in the current situation. This refers to the 1943 massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Kyiv and Warsaw did not publically confirm any dispute during the talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-reportedly-proposes-un-mandate-and-referendum-in-crimea/	2024-09-19T07:00:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158687722.jpg
EU allocates over $100 million from Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine in winter	The EU will support Ukraine with 160 million euros ($178 million) ahead of winter to support the population following Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sept. 19. Close to 100 million euros ($111 million) of the funding comes from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets in the EU, von der Leyen said. &quot;Russia must pay for the destruction it caused,&quot; von der Leyen said. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts and destroying around 9 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity Around 60 million euros ($67 million) of the EU aid will go toward humanitarian aid such as shelters and heaters. 100 million euros ($111 million) will be spent on repairing energy infrastructure and developing renewable energy. EU ambassadors agreed on May 8 to use the windfall profits from the frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Kyiv is expected to receive roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) every year, according to earlier discussions.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-100-million-support-winter/	2024-09-19T05:58:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2152007741.jpg
MEPs vote in support of Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, Taurus missiles delivery	The European Parliament passed a resolution on Sept. 19 calling for EU member states to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of Western-supplied weapons inside Russia, and accelerate weapons deliveries, &quot;including Taurus missiles.&quot; While Kyiv has received long-range missiles from partners like the U.S., the U.K., and France, Ukrainian forces are restricted from using the weapons to hit deep inside Russian territory due to Washington&apos;s claims this could escalate the war. Germany has held back entirely on delivering long-range Taurus missiles, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz repeatedly citing a fear of escalation. Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front &quot;even if other countries decide otherwise,&quot; Scholz said on Sept. 14. His comments came after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, despite media reports suggesting the restrictions could be lifted. &quot;Without lifting current restrictions, Ukraine cannot fully exercise its right to self-defense and remains exposed to attacks on its population and infrastructure,&quot; the European Parliament&apos;s resolution said. The text also called for member states &quot;to accelerate the delivery of weapons, air defense systems, and ammunition, including Taurus missiles.&quot; The resolution additionally called for EU states to &quot;maintain and extend the Council&#x2019;s sanctions policy against Russia, Belarus, and non-EU countries and entities providing Russia with military and dual-use technologies.&quot; The motion was passed with 425 votes in favor, 131 against, and 63 abstentions.	https://kyivindependent.com/meps-vote-in-support-of-ukrainian-strikes-inside-russia-delivery-of-taurus-missiles/	2024-09-19T05:13:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1785291162.jpg
Controversial MP dismissed from Ukrainian Parliament's National Security Committee	Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted unanimously on Sept. 18 to dismiss the controversial lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla from her position as deputy head of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense. The central figure of many controversies, Bezuhla has repeatedly made headlines with her harsh criticism of the former and current military leadership, including ex-Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi and his successor, Oleksandr Syrskyi, as well as former Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The parliament&apos;s Committee on Rules of Procedure first supported a resolution to dismiss Bezuhla in January, but a decision was needed from each party faction in parliament. Bezuhla was dismissed as the head of the subcommittee on civilian oversight over the military in July, a decision she claimed was a &quot;reaction to speaking the truth about the problems in the Armed Forces.&quot; She then resigned from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party. Bezuhla said that after five years on the National Security Committee, she has decided to transition to a role in the Foreign Affairs Committee to &quot;show the truth to everyone.&quot; She plans to continue to push for oversight on &quot;the national security and defense sector, which is the foundation of working with the military in all successful countries, but which is very weak here.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/controversial-mp-dismissed-from-ukrainian-parliaments-national-security-committee/	2024-09-19T04:26:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1243727492.jpeg
We asked 5 prominent Ukrainians to respond to Donald Trump Jr's 'Negotiate with Russia' op-ed	Two influential and controversial U.S. figures stepped into the debate over Ukraine&apos;s potential long-range strikes on Russian territory by claiming such a move could result in &quot;the end of the human species.&quot; In a joint opinion piece published on Sept. 17 by The Hill, Donald Trump Jr. and former U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argued that lifting restrictions on long-range missile attacks would mean the NATO military alliance was &quot;at war&quot; with Moscow. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses and new ones it is pleading for to strike military targets such as airfields and military bases located deep inside Russian territory. The issue is expected to be on the agenda at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr is expected to visit the U.S. during that period to also hold discussions on the matter with his American counterpart Joe Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris, currently vice president, and Donald Trump, who is seeking to return as leader of the world&#x2019;s most powerful country. As discussions between Ukraine and its Western allies have progressed, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have upped their rhetoric, claiming that such a move would equate to NATO waging war with Russia. Russia has consistently issued threats, including nuclear ones, since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but none of them have materialized. Trump Jr., the son of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump, and Kennedy Jr., known for pushing multiple conspiracy theories, said lifting restrictions &quot;would put the world at greater risk of nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis.&quot; &quot;It is past time to de-escalate this conflict. This is more important than any of the political issues our nation argues about,&quot; they wrote, adding: &quot;Nuclear war would mean the end of civilization as we know it, maybe even the end of the human species.&quot; We asked five prominent Ukrainians what they thought of the piece.

(Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Prof. Olexiy HaranUniversity of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, and research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation &quot;Frankly speaking, it seems that the authors do not understand the reasons for the war and Russia&apos;s aims. They are only repeating Russian lies. Escalation from the side of the West? Come on! &quot;The authors pretend they do not know the facts. In 1994 Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal &#x2013; the third largest in the world &#x2013; in exchange for territorial guarantees provided by the UK, the US and &#x2026;. Russia. &quot;In 2010, Ukraine officially declared itself to be neutral. Until 2014, Ukrainians were strongly against joining NATO. &quot;And, nevertheless, Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014. Putin is openly saying there is no separate Ukrainian state, Ukrainians should be part of the &apos;Great Russian people.&apos; &quot;He is annexing Ukrainian territory. The former Russian empire is trying to come back. &quot;According to the U.N. Charter Ukraine, as a founding member of the U.N., has the full right to defend itself. We may criticize the Biden administration but only for being slow in providing support and weapons to the victim of aggression. &quot;The whole country is being bombarded from the bases inside Russia, Ukrainian civilians are dying every day. Can Ukraine strike back on Russian bases? &quot;Or Russia should be allowed to continue to destroy the whole country. Instead, the authors of the article yield to Putin&#x2019;s nuclear blackmail. They say: &apos;No vital American interest is at stake.&apos; &quot;If Russia succeeds it will be a signal to all other tyrannies in the world to start aggressions and to use nuclear blackmail. We will live in a world of the jungle.&quot; author and former diplomat &quot;In order for there to be a nuclear exchange, the President of the Russian Federation has to decide to initiate it. It does not occur automatically when he gets angry or humiliated enough. &quot;He is not a video game boss with a slowly filling rage meter. This man, who lives in unbelievably luxury, obsessed with his own personal safety and status, has to consciously decide to die in nuclear fire. That&#x2019;s the threshold. &quot;As I write this and perhaps even as you read it, the Toropets Arsenal, one of the largest arms stockpiles in Russia, is burning from what was reportedly a mass strike with over a hundred Ukrainian UAVs. &quot;It is over 500 kilometres from the frontline, and far closer to Moscow and St. Petersburg than to Kyiv, Kharkiv or Lviv. Yet the sky is miraculously free of nuclear missiles, and the horizon of mushroom clouds. &quot;Are we supposed to believe, as Donald Trump Jr. and RFK Jr. apparently do, that Putin is willing to end all life on earth over a strike on a strategic stockpile, but only if the munition that delivers it was made in a Western factory?&quot; (L to R) Eric Trump, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. attend a remembrance ceremony on the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center at Ground Zero, in New York City, U on Sep. 11, 2024. (Adam Gray / AFP via Getty Images)Nataliia Shapovaleconomist, and head of the Kyiv School of Economics &quot;Kennedy and Trump Jr. are wrong: complacency with Russia&apos;s nuclear blackmail doesn&apos;t reduce the risk of escalation for the U.S. and the world&#x2014;it increases it. Yielding to Russia&apos;s threats emboldens Moscow and conveys that whatever Russia does, the U.S. can&apos;t stop them. &quot;Russia has been continuously probing the U.S. and NATO&apos;s responses to its violations of international law and human rights. So far, Russia hasn&apos;t faced any strong reaction. Russia violated the sovereignty of independent states in Europe; committed war crimes; kidnapped thousands of children; used U.S. technology to create deadly drones and missiles; collaborated with Iran and North Korea on weapon production; occupied a nuclear plant, risking a catastrophic meltdown; and destroyed one of Europe&apos;s largest water dams. &quot;Therefore, Russia has no motivation to pursue peace, neither through negotiations nor through war. And this is what Kennedy and Trump Jr. are not saying in their appeasement proposal: What leverage, what bargain with Russia will they offer in the negotiations? &quot;If the U.S. cannot offer deterrence and is not willing to give Russia a strong response &#x2014; even by the hands of Ukrainian soldiers &#x2014; because they don&apos;t have this leverage. &quot;Kennedy and Trump Jr. are effectively proposing to negotiate peace by allowing Russia to occupy Ukraine, making Russia NATO&apos;s neighbor, triggering massive refugee flows and genocide in plain sight.&quot; president of the Kyiv School of Economics &quot;RFK and Donald Trump Jr. say the U.S. should surrender Ukraine to avoid nuclear war, giving Russia a rhetorical victory after its failure to secure one on the battlefield. This defeatist stance disregards centuries of American courage and leadership in defending freedom. &quot;Their argument reinforces two Russian propaganda narratives. First, it frames Russia&apos;s invasion as a response to NATO, ignoring Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. Second, it portrays Russia&#x2019;s lack of action against Ukraine&apos;s successes and Western support not as a sign of weakness or bluff, but as calculated strategic restraint. &quot;The piece remains lofty, avoiding specifics or factual depth. The authors largely oppose granting Ukraine the autonomy to use Western weapons, without addressing the critical reasons behind this necessity. In reality, the authors show little interest in the actual reasons or how these weapons will be used. &quot;Instead, they engage in demagoguery, simply opposing any potential decision by the Biden administration to lift this policy restriction, driven by political motivations. &quot;It&#x2019;s disheartening to witness U.S. domestic politics aligning some politicians with Russian propaganda, undermining national security and diminishing America&#x2019;s global standing by portraying it as vulnerable to Putin&#x2019;s empty threats.&quot; Son of former US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr. speaks during the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US on July 17, 2024. (Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)Danylo Lubkivsky director of the Kyiv Security Forum &quot;Despite the famous names of the authors of this op-ed, it looks like a weak attempt to engage the U.S. into direct talks with Russia on Russia&apos;s terms. In my opinion this is a classic case of myopia, when completely narrow political interests prevail over strategic thinking, and it&apos;s clear in this message. &quot;From my perspective, both the key idea and the arguments they use are misleading. Since talking to Russia on Russia&apos;s terms means to accept Russia&apos;s aggression, and a Western defeat. And this will be clear not only for the Kremlin, but also for other capitals that closely follow the developments of the strategic activities of the U.S. and Western allies. &quot;The key idea of their piece is misleading since they insist on starting direct talks with Russia on Russia&apos;s terms. But also, they use false arguments. &quot;They say: &apos;Imagine if Russia were providing another country with missiles, training and targeting information to strike deep into American territory.&apos; &quot;This is false since the way Western allies support Ukraine fulfils the U.N. charter which clearly recognises the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the U.N. &quot;If Ukraine strikes into Russian territory, this is a legitimate right of Ukraine to do so. And the argument we make to our Western allies is that no artificial restrictions should be on the usage of weapons because we have the full right according to international law to strike to attack legitimate military targets on Russian territory. &quot;So instead of getting afraid of Putin&apos;s red lines, I would advise the authors of this piece that the West should long ago have imposed its own critical limits. &quot;If you give up, who will respect your interests?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-asked-3-prominent-ukrainians-to-respond-to-donald-trump-jrs-negotiate-with-russia-op-ed/	2024-09-19T03:25:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162187609.jpg
Ukrainian parliament renames over 300 settlements relating to Russia, Soviet Union	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on Sept. 19 to rename 327 settlements that had names related to the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. Ukraine&apos;s parliament outlawed most Soviet and communist symbols, street names, and monuments as part of a decommunization process in 2015, and many cities, which had received new names under the Soviet authorities, were renamed to reflect their Ukrainian identity. President Volodymyr Zelensky then signed a law in April 2023 that banned naming geographic sites in Ukraine after Russian figures or historical events in response to the Russian invasion. Lawmaker Roman Lozynskyi described the decision as &quot;truly historic&quot; and &quot;what should have been done 33 years ago,&quot; when Ukraine gained its independence. &quot;Names imposed on us by Moscow over the centuries will finally be sent to the dustbin of history.&quot; &quot;Towns and villages will return to their historical names, or receive new ones proposed by local councils,&quot; Lozynskyi said. The cities to be renamed include Chervonohrad in Lviv Oblast. The city, whose name refers to the color red, was called Khrystynopil until it was renamed by the Soviet authorities in 1951. The new name, Sheptytskyi, was the name of a Ukrainian bishop from the region. The village of Krasnohrad in Kharkiv Oblast, whose name also refers to the Russian word for the color red, will be renamed Berestyn, after the nearby river of Berestova. The city of Druzhba in Sumy Oblast has had the name Khutir Mykhailivskyi restored. This was the city&apos;s original name before it was changed to Druzhba, meaning Friendship, by the Soviet authorities in 1962. The start of the full-scale invasion the city regularly comes under attack due to its location just a few kilometers from the border with Russia. Novomoskovsk, a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, has been renamed Samar, which refers to the original name of the local Cossack settlement, which was renamed after Moscow in 1794. According to Lozynskyi, the Verkhovna Rada still needs to make a decision on the naming of another 200 settlements across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-votes-to-rename-over-300-settlements/	2024-09-19T03:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
IEA recommends 10 steps for Ukraine's energy security ahead of winter	The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Sept. 19 issued a 10-step action plan to help Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure tackle the coming winter. The Ukrainian power grid has been heavily damaged during Russian aerial attacks, and it remains unclear how much of the infrastructure can be repaired before the temperatures drop. Energy deficits necessitated rolling blackouts during the summer and autumn, with some officials warning that Ukrainians may have electricity for 6-7 hours per day in the upcoming winter. The measures recommended by the IEA include &quot;bolstering the physical and cyber security of critical energy infrastructure, expediting the delivery of equipment and spare parts for repairs, (and) accelerating the decentralization of power supply,&quot; according to a press release sent to the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv previously said that 85% of Ukrainian energy facilities have been reinforced to withstand further Russian attacks. The international institution also recommended &quot;investing in energy efficiency&quot; and &quot;increasing the capacity to import electricity and gas from the European Union.&quot; The IEA further said that Ukraine should prepare backup options for winter heating, like LPG heaters, and build up natural gas storage levels. Foreign partners should then coordinate their approaches for Ukraine and Moldova, as the two countries&apos; security issues are closely linked. Finally, the organization called for &quot;laying the groundwork for a modern, market-based, resilient and sustainable Ukrainian energy system, well integrated with the EU system.&quot; &quot;The situation in Ukraine is one of the most pressing energy security issues in the world today,&quot; IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s energy system has made it through the past two winters thanks to the resilience, courage, and ingenuity of its people and strong solidarity from its international partners. But this winter will be, by far, its sternest test yet.&quot; Russia launched a massive campaign against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure in the winter of 2022-2023, causing large-scale blackouts amid freezing temperatures. Another wave of mass attacks came in the spring of 2024, destroying entire power plants along with much of Ukraine&apos;s generation capacity.	https://kyivindependent.com/iea-recommends-10-steps-for-ukraine/	2024-09-19T02:02:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147744588.jpeg
Indian shells flowing to Ukraine, despite protests from Russia, Reuters reports	Artillery ammunition manufactured in India is being diverted to Ukraine &quot;despite protests from Moscow,&quot; Reuters reported on Sept. 19, citing customs data and nearly a dozen Indian and European government and defense industry officials. One of Russia&apos;s strategic allies, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023. India has publicly said it has not sent or sold artillery shells directly to Ukraine, but multiple sources told Reuters that New Dehli &quot;has not taken any action to throttle the supply&quot; to European countries, from where the munitions are diverted to Ukraine. Indian-made shells have been flowing into Ukraine via Europe for over a year, according to Reuters. Three Indian officials told Reuters that the Kremlin &quot;has raised the issue on at least two occasions, including during a July meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Indian counterpart.&quot; Other sources told Reuters that India was producing a small fraction of the total ammunition being used by Ukraine, &quot;with one official estimating that it was under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv&quot; since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Reuters could not determine if the Indian munitions were resold or donated to Kyiv by European partners, but Czechia and Italy are thought to be among the countries delivering Indian-manufactured arms to Ukraine. Czechia unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners earlier this year amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told the Kyiv Independent in July that the initiative had secured funds for 500,000 rounds and hopes to finance 300,000 more by the end of 2024. Several countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Canada, and the Netherlands, have since contributed funds to the Czech initiative. In February, Der Spiegel reported that Germany was conducting negotiations to procure ammunition from India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kyiv on Aug. 23, marking the first time an Indian prime minister set foot in Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established over 30 years ago. The visit came just weeks after Modi&apos;s trip to Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/indian-shells-russia-ukraine-reuters/	2024-09-19T01:38:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1258980497.jpg
Blackouts caused by Russian attacks driving Ukrainians abroad, UN monitor says	Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure caused a sharp rise in Ukrainians citing blackouts as a reason for leaving the country over the summer, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said in a report published on Sept. 19. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts and affecting millions of civilians. At least 18 people were killed in the vicinity of the strikes, and at least 84 were injured, the report said. The attacks destroyed around 9 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity, &quot;equivalent to half of what Ukraine requires during winter months,&quot; the report said. Border monitoring carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) &quot;indicated a slight rise in departures from Ukraine due to lack of access to electricity, water, and heating beginning in April,&quot; the report said. That rise &quot;starkly increased&quot; by June, and in July, nearly half (49%) of those &quot;interviewed at the border departing Ukraine reported they were leaving due to the energy situation.&quot; &quot;During the summer period, energy-related reasons were the second most important factor contributing to departures, in addition to broader concerns related to the volatile security situation,&quot; the HRMMU said. The report highlighted that Ukraine&apos;s National Bank revised its forecast on population movement for the coming year due to the destruction inflicted on Ukraine&apos;s energy system. The National Bank now projects an additional 500,000 people will be displaced between 2024 and 2025. &quot;From heating homes and ensuring clean water to powering online education, running businesses, and functioning health services, the destruction of electricity infrastructure affects almost every aspect of daily life,&quot; said HRMMU Head Danielle Bell. According to one energy company cited in the report, the attacks damaged three times more Ukrainian power generation units than during the campaign of strikes during the winter of 2022-2023. The HRMMU noted that the attacks since March targeted electricity generation facilities to a much larger extent than the previous campaign of strikes. Experts told HRMMU that the upcoming winter may see outages of between 4 and 18 hours per day. Blackouts particularly impact those living in cities, where inhabitants rely on central heating. In Kyiv, for example, 95% of the city&apos;s three million inhabitants &quot;rely on centralized district heating, which is delivered to consumers in high-rise buildings using electric pumps,&quot; the report said. The strikes impacted not only heating but also water distribution, as electricity is required to distribute water to consumers. &quot;Most municipal water utilities lack backup energy sources to ensure consistent supply in the case of prolonged power outages,&quot; the report said. The HRMMU also highlighted that power is needed for schools &quot;and to provide internet access for the 1.7 million children in Ukraine who attend school online&quot; due to the safety risks of attending in-person. Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian electricity infrastructure &quot;likely violated all three principles of international humanitarian law,&quot; the HRMMU concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/blackouts-ukrainians-hrmmu-report/	2024-09-19T01:04:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155458627.jpg
Russian attacks kill 5, injure 31 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed five civilians and injured at least 31 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Sept. 19. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing all 42 drones launched by Russia overnight, as well as one Kh-59/69 guided air missile. Russia also launched three S-300/S-400 anti-aircraft guided missiles from Belgorod Oblast toward the city of Kharkiv No casualties were reported in Kharkiv, but 7 people were injured and one person was killed as a result of Russian attacks in Kharkiv Oblast over the past day. Russian shelling injured three women and three men aged 50 to 85 in Kupiansk, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In the nearby village of Hlushkivka, shelling injured a 50-year-old man and killed a 55-year-old woman. In Zaporizhzhia, a guided bomb attack killed one 74-year-old woman and injured two other women aged 67. In total, Russian forces struck 12 settlements in the region 161 times over the past day, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast came under Russian drone and artillery attacks over the past day, killing a 42-year-old man and injuring four people, including a 9-year-old boy. The attacks damaged five high-rise buildings, two educational institutions two administrative buildings, a post office, and seven shops, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Six people were injured in Kherson Oblast over the past day as a result of Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Prokudin did not specify where the casualties were reported but said that Russian forces targeted residential areas in the main population centers of the region, damaging a high-rise building and three houses. Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported that 10 civilians had been injured in five different settlements as a result of Russian attacks over the past day. In Sumy Oblast, two civilians were killed and two others were injured after the town of Krasnopil was targeted by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-sept-19/	2024-09-18T23:30:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/4b9f44b6-42c4-4d16-be1c-4a18a0aa543e.jpeg
Opinion: The harsh truth behind Ukraine’s peace prospects	Plans for ending the war, rumors of a new &#x201C;Minsk 3.0&#x201D; contact group, preparations for elections in Ukraine&#x2026; The casual observer might be excused for thinking peace in Ukraine is just around the corner. This is fueled by a lot of wishful thinking both in Ukraine and abroad, but the reality is far less rosy. Ever since the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland &#x2013; which showcased Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to gather large crowds of diplomats and state leaders, but arguably did little to move talks forward &#x2013; there have been growing demands for an &#x201C;exit plan.&#x201D; To his credit, President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly trumpeted a message of peace and diplomacy that Western audiences want to hear, adding that Ukrainian strength accelerates the timeline. But Russia has shown little interest in peace, likely because it believes it&#x2019;s winning. Moscow is pushing for an aggressive deal, with hints from Russian officials suggesting demands ranging from control of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region to that of Odesa and Kharkiv oblasts, importantly with constraints on Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities. These terms are unacceptable to Ukraine, but Moscow seems to hope declining Western support will eventually force Kyiv&#x2019;s hand. Western pressure for a diplomatic solution is somewhat understandable. The full-scale war has lasted 2.5 years, and Europe and the United States have provided 185 billion euros ($205.8 billion) between January 2022 and June 2024, according to the Kiel Institute&#x2019;s Ukraine Support Tracker, with another 100 billion-some euros (over $100 billion) yet to be allocated. While this aid is dwarfed by Ukraine&#x2019;s own sacrifices, it is significant. Meanwhile, Western societies have faced rising living costs and a surge of populism fueled by Russian propaganda. Hence the question, &#x201C;How much longer?&#x201D; There&#x2019;s a growing eagerness for updates on peace plans and fears that further escalation could derail talks. This thinking partially rests on the flawed assumption that the situation can be managed into resolution &#x2013; like trying to clean the Augean Stables with a carefully structured Excel sheet rather than Herculean strength. As was the case a year ago, there is no zone of possible agreement. Russia seeks to obliterate Ukraine as a nation but would likely settle for a pause, giving it time to re-stock while Ukraine strips away defense capabilities only to be invaded again. Russia believes that, with enough pressure, Ukraine will seek temporary respite. Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery at their military positions in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on July 29, 2024. (Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)For Ukraine, this is the last resort. Meanwhile, Kyiv continues to look for creative, asymmetric ways to increase pressure on a brittle foe. The recently discussed long-range attacks on Russian territory are part of this strategy, potentially pushing back Russian air bases and weakening its air supremacy. Both sides are exhausted, and backchannel negotiations are ongoing, as evidenced by a series of prisoner swaps &#x2013; these don&#x2019;t happen without coordination and sign-offs. But both sides are stuck, unable to move from low-level discussions to larger issues like a pause in hostilities, the return of abducted children, or nuclear safety. The gulf between them is too vast, and the hope that one side will break (a real possibility) persists. For now, Ukraine and Russia remain locked in a war of attrition, hoping to spread the conflict to &#x201C;friendly blocs&#x201D; that can bear the immense costs, or alternative theaters (to oversimplify, an air defense missile used in Israel or sent to Taiwan is one that can&#x2019;t protect Ukrainian cities &#x2013; and vice versa). Throughout the war, public opinion and media have fluctuated between seeing Russia as either having endless resources or being crippled by mismanagement and corruption. Proponents of the latter argue that Russia will run out of manpower, money, or tanks within the next 12 to 18 months, suggesting hope for mid-to-late 2025, or even 2026. But as Ukrainians often point out: Ukraine needs to survive until then. The West has employed a particularly ineffective strategy to exploit Russia&#x2019;s weaknesses. By introducing new weapons slowly, publicly, and on a small scale, it has diminished their impact and given Russia time to adapt. A more optimistic take is that better planning was the focus of recent visits by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Their goal, rather than fueling disappointment over not lifting the long-range strike ban, was to refine plans ahead of an expected meeting between Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden later this month. A detailed roadmap for Ukraine support could help coordinate the logistics, composition, and timing of supplies (all objectively a complex issues). In the meantime, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies should brace for a stream of unhelpful headlines. Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s visit to Mongolia, a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) that issued an arrest warrant for him, demonstrated the limits of international law. The upcoming BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan &#x2013; likely to be well-attended by leaders of the so-called Global South (including Western allies or at least partners) &#x2013; will further erode the narrative of Russia&#x2019;s international isolation and open the door to more diplomatic visits and trade. It could also bring a security boost in the form of a long-anticipated strategic pact with Iran (though that relationship remains unpredictable). A series of elections in key countries could also see victories for Russia-friendly, or at least anti-system, figures. In less than two weeks, Austria&#x2019;s parliamentary elections could bring the far-right, anti-Western ideologue Herbert Kickl of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) to power. Looking further ahead, Moldova is set to elect a new president in October, a testing ground for pro-Russian candidates ahead of next year&#x2019;s parliamentary elections. Czechia and Germany will hold parliamentary elections next year, with the topic of refugees likely to dominate the agenda (Germany just saw two pro-Russian parties win local elections). Poland will also elect a new president. A possible victory for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, though less likely given the momentum of the Kamala Harris campaign, adds a nuanced layer. Officials in Kyiv have mixed views, fearing more &#x201C;drip-feed&#x201D; support from the Harris administration (a &#x201C;slow death,&#x201D; as one senior Ukrainian government advisor put it). Nevertheless, a Trump presidency would likely strain the transatlantic alliance &#x2013; something Russia would be eager to exploit, as it plans to do with other elections, slowly eroding the coalition backing Ukraine. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, it has been clear that drip-funding Ukraine, self-imposing red lines, and avoiding so-called escalatory measures would be the most expensive path to victory. Yet time and again, key allies have chosen this approach. This has been devastating for Ukraine, which has endured unimaginable hardship so that Russia could be contained in a politically palatable way. One of the most pressing challenges Ukraine faces is the condition of its power grid, which has been decimated by Russian attacks. While stopgap measures are in place, the country will likely face major blackouts this winter. A combination of factors could spark a new refugee crisis (albeit much smaller than earlier waves). High-rise buildings, which house most of Ukraine&#x2019;s urban residents, could become uninhabitable if water pumps fail due to power outages and burst pipes in subzero temperatures. Rolling blackouts will also affect schools &#x2013; both remote and in shelters &#x2013; forcing parents to leave rather than endure a fifth year (since Covid) of disrupted education for their children. Blackouts in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on April 21, 2024. (Serhii Korovayny/The Kyiv Independent)This, indeed, is Russia&#x2019;s objective: depriving Ukrainians of energy to accelerate the ethnic cleansing of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory. Additionally, a new wave of refugees could inflame anti-Ukrainian sentiment across the region. Financial and social problems are also mounting. Ukraine faces a 2024 budget gap of Hr 500 billion (about $12 billion), though recent aid has slightly reduced this amount, &#xA0;and another $15 billion shortfall next year. Even with more aid, this likely means tax hikes and inflation, further impacting living standards. With social discontent rising due to heavy-handed mobilization, the risks of populism and government dysfunction are growing. Keeping Ukraine on the edge sustains Russian resolve, fostering the illusion that victory is near. This, in turn, makes peace terms even harder for Ukraine to accept. While the past years have shown that anything is possible, without significantly increased aid, we may be just as far &#x2013; if not further &#x2013; from a peace deal.

Harris to meet Zelensky in Washington next week, CNN reports	United States Vice President Kamala Harris plans to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, D.C. next week, CNN reported on Sept. 18, citing sources familiar with the arrangements. The impending meeting comes less than 50 days before the U.S. presidential election, a race that has been characterized by dramatic upheavals and sharply contrasting views on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky will visit the U.S. next week to meet with President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Harris will then meet with Zelensky herself in Washington, three sources told CNN. Zelensky&apos;s U.S. visit is an opportunity for him to champion his Victory Plan for Ukraine, which he said on Sept. 18 is now fully complete and ready to present Kyiv&apos;s allies. Zelensky previously said he plans to present the details to Biden during their meeting. The plan will also be presented to Harris and former U.S. President Donald Trump, Zelensky said. Trump told a reporter on Sept. 18 that he will &quot;probably&quot; meet with Zelensky when he visits the U.S., but did not give any details or say that such a meeting had been planned. While Harris&apos;s campaign rhetoric has echoed the Biden administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, Trump has refused to say he backs Ukraine&apos;s victory over Russia and has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Harris represented the U.S. at Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit in Switzerland in June, an international conference centered on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula.	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-to-meet-zelensky-in-washington-next-week-cnn-reports/	2024-09-18T21:41:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167299408.jpg
Russia, Pakistan strengthen economic ties, expand trade	Russia and Pakistan hope to expand bilateral trade and improve their economic cooperation, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk and Pakistani Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar said during a joint press conference in Islamabad on Sept. 18. Moscow also pledged support for Pakistan&apos;s bid to join the BRICS international alliance. While Russia has faced increasing economic isolation due to Western sanctions following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, trade between Moscow and Islamabad has expanded, reaching $1 billion in 2023. The nations hope to continue expanding their economic relationship despite the restrictions imposed by sanctions, Dar said during the press conference. &quot;Even today, we looked at how to expand our relationship, and overcome this constraint of the banking system, which you know are facing sanctions, which obviously constrains our relationship, the volume of our relationship could have been much bigger,&quot; Dar said. Pakistan aims to expand cooperation with Russia &quot;across multiple sectors,&quot; including the purchase of Russian Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG.) Russia will also back Pakistan&apos;s membership in BRICS, a bloc of countries that now includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. &quot;Of course, we would be supportive,&quot; Overchuk said of Pakistan&apos;s application to the bloc. Pakistan applied for BRICS membership in 2023. The alliance will hold a summit in Kazan, Russia, in October.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-pakistan-strengthen-economic-ties-expand-trade/	2024-09-18T18:48:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/pakistan.png
Trump plans appearance with Polish president, claims he will 'probably' meet Zelensky next week	Former U.S. President and current Republican candidate Donald Trump is reportedly planning a joint appearance with Polish President Andrzej Duda and believes he will &quot;probably&quot; meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky next week, Trump and sources close to him said on Sept. 18. Foreign leaders, including Zelensky and Duda, are convening in New York City over the next few days for the 79th General Assembly of the United Nations. &quot;Probably, yes,&quot; Trump answered when asked by a reporter if he plans to meet Zelensky during his visit to the U.S. He did not provide additional details on any planned meeting. Trump is also planning a joint appearance with Duda at a monument at a Polish-American Roman Catholic shrine near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sources familiar with the arrangements told Reuters on Sept. 18. The plans are not yet finalized, the sources said. If the joint appearance goes forward, &quot;there will definitely be an opportunity to exchange a few words and talk about the most important topics,&quot; the source said. Malgorzata Paprocka, an aide to Duda, said that Duda&apos;s office did not initiate a meeting with Trump. Organizers invited both Duda and Trump to the unveiling of the monument, and it was not clear if Trump would in fact attend, she said. &#xA0; Pennsylvania is a battleground state in the U.S. presidential election and boasts a large Polish-American population. Vice President Kamala Harris leveraged the Polish-American community in a critique of Trump during the Sept. 10 debate, also held in Pennsylvania. &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,&quot; she said. Duda, a nationalist politician, has expressed staunch support for Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia while maintaining that Poland&apos;s interests come first and forging close ties with Trump and other U.S. Republicans. Trump and Duda met in New York City in April to discuss a range of foreign policy issues, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. During the debate against Harris, Trump refused to say outright that he hopes Ukraine will defeat Russia. Trump and Zelensky have not met in person since Trump&apos;s first term in office. Zelensky spoke with Trump via phone on July 19. Zelensky said in August that during his September visit to the U.S., he intends to present the details of his Victory Plan for Ukraine to U.S. President Joe Biden as well as to presidential candidates Harris and Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-appearance-with-polish-president-claims-he-will-probably-meet-zelensky-next-week/	2024-09-18T17:54:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162600797.jpg
Russia’s Pokrovsk offensive slows but relief looks temporary for Ukraine	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. POKROVSK DISTRICT, Donetsk Oblast &#x2013; Marked by wide plumes of gray smoke on the horizon, the open fields stretching out southeast of the city of Pokrovsk don&#x2019;t resemble a front line that has stabilized. Following a dirt road between a treeline and a field of drying, unharvested sunflowers, the military car gains speed as it enters the range of enemy suicide drones. There is a safer road to the positions, says artilleryman Andrii, callsign &#x201C;Mazhor,&#x201D; from the front seat, but they take this one, as the smoother ride causes less damage to the unit&#x2019;s precious fleet of cars. In the absence of the small 3D-printed detectors that many soldiers carry, the artillerymen receive warnings of drones in the air on WhatsApp. For now, the sky is clear, but the longer one spends in the open and the closer one gets to the zero line, the risk from all kinds of threats from the sky &#x2014; as does the volume of the battles nearby &#x2014; only increases. Smoke rises over a field near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 9, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Throughout this third summer of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in Ukraine, this area has consistently been where fighting is at its most intense. Struggling to consolidate resistance along unified lines of defense in the face of waves of infantry assaults covered by dense use of Russian artillery, glide bombs, and drones, Ukrainian forces have been losing territory at a rate not seen since 2022. Since the first break through of Ukrainian defense lines in April near the village of Ocheretyne, Russian forces have advanced over 20 kilometers towards Pokrovsk, with the key logistics hub once considered to be deep in the rear, now gradually coming in range of Russian artillery and suicide drones. Despite Kyiv&#x2019;s attempts to draw away Russian forces from Pokrovsk with the surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast, Moscow made sure not to take its foot off the pedal, further intensifying its attacks over August. A map of the Russian offensive on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast as of Sept. 17, 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Kyiv needed to act quickly and did, transferring brigades both from strategic reserves and less-active sectors into the fight. Andrii&#x2019;s unit, Ukraine&#x2019;s 15th National Guard Brigade, better known as Kara-Dag, is part of the rescue force. Deployed to Zaporizhzhia Oblast since its formation in early 2023, the brigade was rushed here at the beginning of September to stem the tide of the Russian offensive. At first, the deployment of fresh forces seemed to have a near-immediate effect: On Sept. 5, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed that the Russian offensive had been halted. On the ground though, the situation remains near-critical, and since Syrskyi&#x2019;s claim, Russian forces have resumed their advances towards Pokrovsk, while also threatening to encircle a large grouping of Ukrainian forces south of the main salient. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent over a week spent in the area, soldiers testified that the offensive on Pokrovsk had indeed slowed somewhat, giving defending forces priceless breathing room to improve positions and better organize their work. In their words though, with systemic issues in the Ukrainian defense not going anywhere, and an overall manpower shortage that has only gotten more acute, the threat of a renewed Russian push to reach the outskirts of the city remains high. The howitzer is hidden away carefully from prying eyes in the sky by two layers of concealment: an array of camouflage netting as well as the slowly browning early autumn foliage. This artillery piece, a Msta-B 152mm towed howitzer that was captured from Russian forces during the Kharkiv counteroffensive in September 2022, is now playing a vital role in stopping its original owners. The name &#x201C;Violetta,&#x201D; scrawled in marker on the breech by Russian soldiers, is a stark contrast to the deadly power of the weapon: the 152mm shell was the munition of choice for heavy artillery bombardments on both sides until Ukraine began to transition to mostly NATO-standard ammunition. The availability of shells for guns like these is a problem that has plagued Ukraine&#x2019;s artillery for the better part of the war, as old stocks of Soviet-era munitions run dry around the world.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)But here, in a testament to how important holding Pokrovsk is for Kyiv, the crew from Kara-Dag is supplied with a constant flow of shells, sourced from a number of different countries, including Ukraine&#x2019;s fledgling homegrown production facilities. Since their deployment to Selydove a week earlier, rarely does much time go by without a fire mission. Selydove, a city with a pre-war population of about 21,000, forms a formidable physical roadblock to the attacking force. According to Andrii, Russian forces continue to attempt assaults on the city, gathering in the neighboring village of Mykhailivka but have not found success recently. &#x201C;Our work is to rain fire on enemy groupings before they get moving,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because of that, the enemy hasn&apos;t moved forward here for two weeks, and the village is full of enemy bodies.&#x201D; Artillerymen of the 15th National Guard Brigade at positions near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 9, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Andrii, an artillery commander in the 15th National Guard Brigade at positions near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 9, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)At the moment, this crew has been assigned to provide counterbattery fire, targeting the very enemy artillery pieces and drone positions that make life for the Ukrainian infantry around Pokrovsk so perilous. Such an assignment exponentially increases the danger the team is under, as they themselves must push a lot further forward towards the line of contact to bring their targets in range. &#x201C;When the enemy took Memryk (a village just east of Selydove), our guys were working from only two kilometers away from them,&#x201D; said Andrii. On the day the Kyiv Independent visited, the crew had already damaged or destroyed two Russian howitzers that morning, a feat confirmed from the air by Ukrainian reconnaissance drones. At a moonlit firing range in an old quarry further in the rear, the silence is broken by the fearsome bursts of large-caliber automatic fire. Here, infantrymen from a fire support company of Ukraine&#x2019;s 68th Jaeger Brigade are testing a new flash suppressor for their U.S.-made M2 Browning heavy machine gun. Operating heavy machine guns like the Browning from a kilometer or two behind the zero line, these men should, in theory, be in less danger than those who they are covering. But here in the Pokrovsk sector, Russian forces have advanced so quickly that they often found themselves under direct assault. &#x201C;The fighting is tough, it&apos;s very dynamic,&#x201D; said Oleksandr, a 32-year-old machine gunner who declined to give his callsign; &#x201C;very often, you simply have a situation where the front line is moving very quickly. &#x201C;It does seem like things have died down a little over the last two weeks,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Before, it felt like basically every mission ended up with us having to change positions, and in some cases, we came into direct contact with the enemy, even though we should be working from further back.&#x201D; An infantryman of the 68th Jaeger Brigade fires a heavy machine gun at a training range in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Deployed to the Pokrovsk sector around the time the Russian offensive accelerated in late spring, the brigade has borne the heavy burden of being at the tip of Moscow&#x2019;s attacking spear. &#x201C;Their tactics never change: they attack with quantity, and we fight them off with quality,&#x201D; said Dmytro &#x201C;Volynets,&#x201D; another machine gunner in the company. &#x201C;If we had that many people, that much ammunition, we would have fought all of them off a long time ago, but instead, we have shortages.&#x201D; The infantrymen&#x2019;s stories testify to the starkly attritional nature of the fight: although Russia&#x2019;s relentless infantry assaults come at a high cost, with enough time and enough fire covering the defending positions, the defenders are inevitably overwhelmed. &#x201C;We can be fighting them off for a while, but eventually our ammunition runs out,&#x201D; said Dmytro, 32. &#x201C;And while they are getting resupplied constantly, we can&apos;t do the same, they cover all the routes, and because of that, we have to give up our positions.&#x201D; An infantryman of the 68th Jaeger Brigade poses for a portrait in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Often, as one incident recalled by Oleksandr demonstrated, localized withdrawals of the infantry in front of them, or of neighboring brigades on the flanks, are not reported to them before it is too late. &#x201C;We were at a position, but when our dugout started burning we had to move and dig in somewhere else,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We were waiting for a car to get us out, we were joined by two wounded guys from our unit, and suddenly we heard Russian voices. We prepared and soon we were in a close firefight; they came up to about 10 meters from us.&#x201D; In the end, Oleksandr&#x2019;s squad was able to escape by laying down suppressive fire and withdrawing under the cover of darkness. With many different units &#x2014; all in various states of combat effectiveness &#x2014; deployed to the Pokrovsk front, effective communication between brigades is a crucial factor that is often lacking , soldiers from both brigades told the Kyiv Independent. One officer of the 68th, who asked not to be identified because of the nature of his comments, said that for months over summer, one of the neighboring brigades would consistently fail to report lost positions, leaving his own units vulnerable from the flank without knowing about it. &#x201C;In our area, there are a lot of different units, and communication between them becomes a big problem,&#x201D; said Oleksandr. &#x201C;You could have 3-4 units fighting in the same sector, but don&apos;t have proper communications between them; they have their radio stations encrypted for their own people. But we try, we look at the identification signs, and we always look to find out who it is that is posted next to us.&#x201D; Infantrymen of the 68th Jaeger Brigade load a heavy machine gun at a training range in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)With time, fighting in a defensive operation that has been far from under control comes at a heavy cost. Asked about the manpower situation in their infantry battalions, officers from both brigades described it as critical. &#x201C;In the last two months here, to be honest, we have had serious losses. Killed, injured, and taken prisoner,&#x201D; said Olena Tarishchuk, a 39-year-old lieutenant responsible for monitoring the morale and mental state of the fire support company&#x2019;s personnel. &#x201C;We need rest, we need rotation, we basically need support. We don&apos;t have enough manpower to carry out our orders.&#x201D; Inevitably, extreme manpower strains, on top of the reluctance of Ukraine&#x2019;s higher command to rotate exhausted units off the front line, take their toll on the infantry&#x2019;s morale. An infantryman of the 68th Jaeger Brigade in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 8, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;In recent times, according to all our consultations and surveys, morale levels are in the worst category at the moment,&#x201D; said Tarishchuk, &#x201C;The guys are simply holding on with their last strength, it&apos;s tough, but still, nobody refuses to go or tries to sit out missions.&#x201D; Though the incursion into Kursk Oblast was praised for giving a sharp boost to morale among both soldiers and civilians across Ukraine, the feeling near Pokrovsk was bittersweet at best, according to Tarishchuk. &#x201C;There was no euphoria among us,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Sure, some of our guys were saying they really wanted to go and fight there (in Kursk Oblast), but most of them were saying &apos;Why didn&apos;t they send those reserves here, those same brigades; we could save the situation here quickly.&quot; Back at the artillery positions of the Kara-Dag Brigade, Andrii&#x2019;s howitzer crew receives a fire mission. Upon the sharp words of &#x201C;Cannon, to battle!&#x201D; from the commander, the men spring into action in a split second, all with a clear vision of their role in the team. One retrieves the shell, another the charge; two men remove the camouflage netting from the Msta-B&#x2019;s huge barrel, and two more begin raising it skywards, in preparation to aim and fire. As the crew gets to work, they don&#x2019;t know yet what the target is: all they have are coordinates, which are quickly converted by the commander into settings for the gun. Five shells are fired in total, each shot briefly igniting the sky in yellow and sending a wave of dirt in all directions.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)As soon as the order to mask up is given, the team finishes their work as quickly as they started it: down goes the barrel, back goes the netting, as everyone shuffles into the trench in expectation of return fire. It&#x2019;s not long before the commander comes with good news: the five shells were enough, almost certainly, to knock out yet another Russian D-30 howitzer working out of a nearby village.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)According to Andrii, Kara-Dag&#x2019;s defense of Selydove is firmly under control. But, in a story that seems to just keep on repeating itself over this summer, Andrii is concerned about the threats from the flanks. On the day of the visit, the commander told the Kyiv Independent that Russian forces had begun making new gains south of Selydove. A few days later, the changes in the line appeared on open-source mapping projects, part of an overall resumption in the Russian moves on Pokrovsk. &#x201C;Selydove is a good place to defend, all we need is a few strong points, and we can hold the line with no problem,&#x201D; said Andrii. &#x201C;But if the Russians go around, it means that our sector will get longer, and to hold that, we will need more forces.&#x201D; Hi, this is Francis Farrell, cheers for reading this article.

Russian troll farm behind fake story about supposed Harris hit and run incident, Microsoft says	A Russian troll farm known as Storm-1516 was behind the creation and dissemination of a fake news story that alleged that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for a hit-and-run in 2011 that paralyzed a girl, Microsoft said in a report published on Sept. 17. CBS News previously debunked the story, but Microsoft&apos;s report was the first indication that Russia was the source of the false news. The story was initially spread by a website disguised as a local San Francisco media outlet and included an embedded video that Microsoft said used a paid actor. Warnings about Russian attempts to influence and interfere in the upcoming U.S. presidential election have increased in months. The Russian state-run media outlet RT, which the U.S. warned earlier in September is actively working with intelligence services in global influence campaigns, is seeking to push voters toward Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, U.S. officials said. Storm-1516 is &quot;adept at grabbing headlines with its outlandish fake videos and scandalous claims,&quot; Microsoft said. It and other Russian troll farms &quot;will likely only escalate its targeting of the Harris-(Tim) Walz campaign in the lead-up to election day.&quot; Beyond the influence campaigns, Microsoft said that &quot;Russian cyber proxies and hacktivist groups&quot; have also been involved in direct attacks on U.S. and EU election infrastructure, such as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on websites associated with elections for the EU parliament earlier in 2024. &#xA0; The usage of such cyber proxies &quot;offer(s) a method for potentially laundering compromising information garnered from a hack-and-leak operation while maintaining a veil of plausible deniability for the Kremlin,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;Cyber proxies may also be employed for stoking fear of electoral disruption just before or on election day in November,&quot; the report added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-bot-farm-behind-fake-story-about-supposed-harris-hit-and-run-incident-microsoft-says/	2024-09-18T13:02:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170586317.jpg
Kremlin's war in Ukraine 'a stunning Russian military failure,' British diplomat says	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has been a &quot;military disaster for the Kremlin,&quot; a British diplomat said on Sept. 18, saying the country&apos;s significant losses in manpower &quot;paint a bleak picture.&quot; Speaking at the Security Cooperation Forum in Vienna, senior military advisor at the U.K. Delegation to the OSCE, Nicholas Aucott, also said factors such as Ukraine&apos;s Kursk incursion and the damaging or destroying of a quarter of the Russian Black Sea Fleet add up to a &quot;stunning Russian military failure.&quot; &quot;It is now two years and 212 days since Russia conducted its full-scale invasion, a military action which Russia envisaged would be over in a matter of days,&quot; he said in comments reported by Ukrinform. &quot;In that context, the current predicament can be construed as nothing less than a military disaster for the Kremlin.&quot; Western intelligence estimates cited by the WSJ on Sept. 17 placed Russian losses at up to 200,000 dead and 400,000 wounded. This is close to Kyiv&apos;s estimates on Moscow&apos;s casualties, which is over 637,000 killed and wounded as of Sept. 18. &quot;At the military level, Ukraine&#x2019;s effective use of maneuver warfare stands in stark contrast to Russia&#x2019;s &apos;meat grinder&apos; tactics,&quot; Aucott said. Ukraine also launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early Aug. 6, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). &quot;Ukraine has a clear right of self-defense against Russia&#x2019;s illegal, unprovoked, and barbaric invasion, and its actions are demonstrative of the ability of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces to achieve strategic surprise and expose Russian weaknesses,&quot; Aucott said. Russia&apos;s counterattack in Kursk Oblast aiming to retake Ukrainian-held territory has been stopped, a spokesperson of the Ukrainian military administration in the region told AFP on Sept. 18. The statement comes a week after Moscow launched a counteroffensive against the western flank of Ukrainian troops in the Russian region. &quot;They tried to attack from the flanks, but they were stopped there,&quot; spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi told AFP. &quot;The situation was stabilized and today everything is under control, they are not successful.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-in-ukraine-a-stunning-russian-military-failure-british-diplomat-says/	2024-09-18T12:07:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1258947571.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Drone attack 'wipes Russian weapons depot off the face of the earth,' Kyiv says	Key developments on Sept. 18: Ukrainian drones successfully targeted a weapons depot in Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast overnight, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 18. Photos and videos shared on Russian Telegram channels early on Sept. 18 showed a number of explosions and a large plume of smoke purportedly at the site of an ammunition depot in the town of Toropets. Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya reported in the morning that a fire had broken out in Toropets due to falling drone debris but claimed the situation was &quot;under control.&quot; Allegedly, the huge stockpile destroyed by a drone overnight in &#x1F1F7;&#x1F1FA; Toropets consisted partly of newly arrived North Korean missiles.#StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/6aYqmFpUbb According to the source, drones from the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, and Ukrainian Armed Forces struck a warehouse storing ballistic missiles, including Iskanders, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery ammunition, and KAB guided bombs. The attack &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth a large warehouse of the main missile and artillery department of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; the source said. &quot;After the arrival of Ukrainian drones, an extremely powerful detonation began,&quot; and the affected area is 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) wide, the source said. &quot;The SBU, together with colleagues from the Armed Forces, continues to methodically reduce the missile potential of the enemy, with which it destroys Ukrainian cities.&quot; The source said that there are plans to conduct similar attacks on other Russian military facilities. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 54 Ukrainian drones had been downed overnight but did not mention any drones downed over Tver Oblast. According to the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s 8 a.m. report, 27 drones were downed over Kursk Oblast, 16 over Bryansk Oblast, seven over Smolensk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast. French Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets destined for Ukraine will be modified to enable them to hit ground targets, the French media outlet Sud-Ouest reported on Sept. 18. In an article detailing the work being carried out at the Cazaux air base, the outlet said modifications for the aircraft will be performed at the facility. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. It is a fourth-generation fighter jet, meaning it is in the same class as the U.S.-made F-16. French President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 6 that an unspecified number would be transferred to Ukraine, but did not provide a timeline. Speaking to French TV after the end of the 80th anniversary of D-Day commemorations in Normandy, Macron also said his country would train Ukrainian pilots. &quot;Tomorrow we will launch a new cooperation and announce the transfer of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Ukraine, made by French manufacturer Dassault, and train their Ukrainian pilots in France,&quot; he said during a live interview. Russia&apos;s counterattack in Kursk Oblast aiming to retake Ukrainian-held territory has been stopped, a spokesperson of the Ukrainian military administration in the region told AFP on Sept. 18. The statement comes a week after Moscow launched a counteroffensive against the western flank of Ukrainian troops in the Russian region. &quot;They tried to attack from the flanks, but they were stopped there,&quot; spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi told AFP. &quot;The situation was stabilized and today everything is under control, they are not successful.&quot; The spokesperson admitted only &quot;some minor successes&quot; by Russia. &quot;The Russians entered one of the settlements. They started fighting for another settlement, but that was it,&quot; he said. Russia claimed to have recaptured 10 settlements only on the first day of the counteroffensive, announcing further advances since then. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early Aug. 6, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Moscow&apos;s troops launched a counterattack last week in an effort to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their positions on Russian soil. Russia has not yet commented on Dmytrashkivskyi&apos;s statement but did not mention any new settlements recaptured in its regular update on Sept. 17. Moscow claimed the same day it had repelled several fresh attempts by Ukraine to cross the border in Kursk Oblast west of the Ukrainian salient. The Wall Street Journal&apos;s recent claims that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the full-scale war with Russia are &quot;exaggerated,&quot; secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Sept. 18. The U.S. outlet wrote on Sept. 17 that according to a &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year,&quot; Ukraine has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. Russian losses were estimated at 200,000 killed and 400,000 wounded, putting the overall casualties of the war to over 1 million. &quot;I think that these are exaggerated data. Definitely... Namely when talking about the recorded number of (Ukrainian soldiers) killed,&quot; Kostenko said. Ukraine has largely avoided commenting on its losses, though President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed. &quot;If we look at the past two years, we had roughly the same number &#x2013; 19,000 each (year). And this is considering only those who were issued official death certificates,&quot; Kostenko said, adding that many are still considered missing. The lawmaker suggested that 50,000 soldiers killed could be an approximate figure, though he admitted he does not have the most accurate data and that even his number could be an overestimation. Regarding Ukraine&apos;s ability to continue to defend itself despite the losses, Kostenko believes that the country still has enough men to mobilize and that everything depends on the ability to enlist more troops. Ukraine has sought to replenish the ranks of its military as the war has been ongoing for two and half years. Kyiv adopted new legislation on mobilization in the spring, lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 and imposing stricter penalties for dodging draft. One person has been killed, and four people, including a nine-year-old boy, have been injured during Russian attacks in the Nikopol district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in southeastern Ukraine, Governor Serhii Lysak said on Sept. 18. The child and two women, aged 43 and 69, were injured during shelling in the city of Marhanets. Lysak earlier reported that a &quot;kamikaze drone strike&quot; in the city of Nikopol had injured a 42-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman. In an update later on Sept. 18, Lysak reported the injured man had died. &quot;Sincere condolences to family and friends,&quot; the governor added. The Russian army regularly fires on the civilian infrastructure of Ukrainian cities, targeting hospitals, among other facilities. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four civilians and injured at least 22 over the previous day, regional authorities reported early on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-drone-attack/	2024-09-18T11:15:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/toropets.jpg
Ukraine's victory plan fully ready, Zelensky says	All points of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan that Kyiv aims to present to Washington have been worked out, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18. Zelensky plans to discuss the plan with U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit to the U.S. later this month. While not revealing all the details, the president previously said that the plan is composed of four main points and a fifth related to the post-war situation. It focuses on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military assistance with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, which left a chunk of Russian territory under Kyiv&apos;s control, is also part of the strategy, Zelensky said. &quot;The most important thing now is the determination to implement it,&quot; the president said in his address. &quot;There isn&apos;t and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply postpone Russian aggression to a later stage.&quot; Ukraine is open to suggestions from the U.S. to strengthen the plan, he added. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Sept. 17 that the plan does not in any way include ceding territory to Russia. &quot;(Freezing of the conflict) will not lead to the end of the war but will only lead to Russia gaining the opportunity to accumulate additional resources and proceed to the third stage (of the war) with more mass killings of civilians in Ukraine,&quot; Podolyak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-victory-plan-ready/	2024-09-18T10:54:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170870951.jpg

Arms depot in Russia's Tver Oblast built to withstand nuclear explosion heavily damaged by Ukrainian drones	Overnight, Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Back in 2018, the Russian Defense Ministry bragged that this facility would be prepared to withstand even a nuclear explosion. Six years later, the claim was proven to be false. According to the SBU, the arsenal stored ballistic missiles, including Iskanders, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery ammunition, and KAB guided bombs. The attack &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth a large warehouse of the main missile and artillery department of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; the SBU source said. The construction of the arsenal, controlled by the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate, began in 2015 in the town of Toropets, located 480 kilometers north of Ukraine. The construction was part of a 2012 government program set to improve Russia&apos;s storage of missiles, ammunition, and explosives. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, the program, worth 90 billion rubles (nearly $980 million), called for 13 modern arms depots to be built. The construction in Toropets, a town of 11,000 people, was to open in October 2018 in compliance with all modern international security standards. &quot;The arsenal ensures safe and secure storage, protects (weapons) from aerial and missile strikes and even from the damage of a nuclear explosion,&quot; then-Deputy Defense Minister Dmitry Bulgakov said in 2018. &quot;If you compare present arsenals with what they used to be &#x2013; storage in open areas and wooden storage facilities &#x2013; and what they are today in concrete storage facilities, the difference is roughly the difference between walking around in body armor that protects you from being hit by bullets and shrapnel, or walking around without body armor,&quot; Bulgakov said. Bulgakov was arrested in July 2024 following corruption allegations. He was one of five top Defense Ministry officials arrested between April and July amid the change in the ministry&apos;s leadership. Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya said on Sept. 18 that a fire broke out in Toropets due to the drone&apos;s debris fall, but the situation was &quot;under control.&quot; An evacuation from Toropets to the neighboring settlement of Zapadnaya Dvina was ordered. Rudenya did not specify the location of the drone crash or the damage it caused. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry, in its report on nighttime drone attacks, did not mention the strikes against Tver Oblast. Yet the source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that a &quot;very powerful detonation&quot; occurred, and the affected area was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) wide. NASA satellites also recorded a surge in thermal activity in Tver Oblast, where the 107th arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate is located. &quot;The arsenal seems to have been built correctly, with bunkered storage facilities that can hold up to 240 tons of ammunition each,&quot; Serhiy Zgurets, military expert and CEO of the Ukrainian media Defense Express, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is supposed to help prevent fire from spilling over from one storage facility to another, but it does not protect these structures from chain detonation,&quot; Zgurets added. The expert assumes that two factors could have influenced the chain detonation. According to Zgurets, the Russian military could have stored ammunition in the open, which made them very vulnerable to the attack. At the same time, he did not rule out the possibility that the Ukrainian drones could have been modified. &quot;The effectiveness of Ukrainian drones has probably increased, as they may have received warheads that can pierce the ceilings of storage facilities,&quot; Zgurets said. In total, about 30,000 tons of ammunition were stored in the arsenal in Toropets, which could have been enough to conduct attacks for months, according to the expert. Russia most likely stored 122 mm Grad ammunition, 82 mm mines, and missiles for Buk medium-range surface-to-air missile systems, among other munitions, according to Zgurets. Despite the successful attack on Toropets, Zgurets warned against underestimating Russia&apos;s electronic warfare but says that there is still an &quot;antidote&quot; to it, as some Ukrainian drones have an inertial guidance system, which is not affected by electronic warfare. Zgurets said that arms depots are among the highest priorities that must be protected by air defense. And if Russian forces did not shoot down all the air targets again, this points to two factors: Ukraine could have used &#x201C;technical tricks&#x201D; to bypass air defense, or the attack was so massive that Russia simply could not protect all of its important targets, the expert said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-said-this-weapons-depot-was-nuclear-bomb-proof-ukraine-just-blew-it-up-with-drones/	2024-09-18T10:16:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-19_35_24.png
Romania urges 'robust' NATO response to airspace violations by Russia	Romania called on Sept. 18 for a &quot;robust and coordinated&quot; response by NATO to Russian drones violating allied airspace during attacks against Ukraine. Speaking at a meeting of the Bucharest Nine (B9) format, Romanian Defense Minister Angel Tilvar called for &quot;enforcing the rotational air defense and integrated anti-missile model as soon as possible.&quot; On several occasions, Romanian authorities have uncovered drone wreckage near their border with Ukraine in the Danube River region. Airspace violations by Russian drones or missiles have been reported also by Moldova, Latvia, and Poland. According to available information, none of the said countries attempted to intercept Russian projectiles. &quot;The B9 states are deeply concerned about the repeated incursions of Russian drones and missiles into NATO airspace in Poland, Romania, and Latvia, as well as the escalation of tensions along NATO&apos;s borders,&quot; Tilvar said during a press briefing after a B9 meeting in Bucharest. &quot;That is why a robust and coordinated response at the allied level is necessary, as well as enforcing the rotational air defense and integrated anti-missile model as soon as possible.&quot; The B9 format includes nine Central and Eastern European members of NATO and EU: Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Tilvar also noted a &quot;worrying&quot; situation in the Black Sea region and a &quot;set of constantly evolving threats&quot; connected mainly to Russia&apos;s hybrid warfare, disinformation, and cyber attacks. The B9 meeting discussed allied support for Ukraine so that &quot;the Ukrainian Armed Forces have the necessary resources at the front,&quot; the minister added. Romania has supported Ukraine throughout the full-scale war, providing artillery, armored vehicles, ammunition, and other aid. Bucharest also hosts a facility for training Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets and pledged to deliver a Patriot air defense system to boost Ukraine&apos;s sky shield. In his first official trip abroad since taking office, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visit Romania earlier on Sept. 18 as the first leg of his European tour. &quot;We are grateful for Romania&apos;s steadfast support from the very start of Russian full-scale aggression,&quot; Sybiha said.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-urges-robust-nato-response/	2024-09-18T09:49:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1916439692.jpg
Finnish president wants Russia excluded from UN Security Council	Finnish President Alexander Stubb supports expanding the U.N. Security Council, abolishing single-member veto rights, and booting out Russia, he told Reuters on Sept. 18. The Finnish president said he is ready to call for these reforms during the upcoming U.N. Assembly in New York. According to Stubb, any council member engaged in an illegal war &quot;such as Russia is in right now in Ukraine&quot; should be suspended. Russia is among the five permanent members of the council, along with the U.S., the U.K., France, and China. Ten other members are selected on a rotating basis. Calls for reforming the institution, namely some of its tenets established as part of post-World War II order, mounted after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv has accused Moscow of abusing its veto rights to paralyze the council and prevent any united action regarding the war. Stubb believes that the number of permanent members should be expanded to 10, including one Latin American country, two African countries, and two Asian countries. The Finnish president also brought up Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, which President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to present during his visit to the U.N. &quot;He has informed us that 90% is already there and the 10% that he will present is what will be needed for him to win this war,&quot; Stubb said. The Nordic politician called on Kyiv&apos;s Western partners to lift their restrictions on long-range strikes. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose country has supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles, was expected to discuss the matter with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, but no decision has been announced. Starmer said that the matter would be addressed at the U.N. assembly &quot;with a wider group of individuals.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/stubb-russia-un-security-council/	2024-09-18T09:02:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/DSC07197------.jpg
State sells iconic Kyiv hotel to Ukrainian businessman for double starting price	Kyiv&#x2019;s iconic &#x201C;Hotel Ukraina,&#x201D; located on the city&#x2019;s central Independence Square, also known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti, was sold in an auction for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million) after being state-owned since 1961, Ukraine&apos;s State Property Fund said. The sale marks one of the country&apos;s largest privatizations of state-owned property in recent years. The auction&#x2019;s winner was Ukrainian businessman Maksym Krippa &#x2014; who bid over double the starting price of Hr 1.05 billion ($25.3 million), according to results on Prozorro.Sale, an online auction system in Ukraine. While Krippa has maintained a relatively low profile throughout his career &#x2014; built largely on gambling, entertainment, and IT &#x2014; this is his second high-ticket purchase over the last year. In 2023, he purchased the Parus skyscraper in downtown Kyiv. The auction was part of Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;Great Privatization&#x201D; drive to sell off large state-owned assets, which was suspended after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The State Property Fund announced it would restart the initiative this September. Vitaly Koval, the head of the State Property Fund, said in early 2024 that Hotel Ukraina is heavily under-booked due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and over $1 million in debt. Koval said in April that the fund does &quot;not see any prospects for state-owned hotels, private businesses will provide these services much better and much more efficiently.&quot; &quot;The funds that will be raised from the privatization of hotels will be used to strengthen our defense capabilities. We must think about efficiency.&quot; Due to its location on a hilltop overlooking Kyiv&apos;s Independence Square, Hotel Ukraina was a fixture in photographs and television reports from one of the most internationally covered events about before Russia launched its war, the 2013-14 EuroMaidan Revolution. The hotel stands along a road leading down to the main square from where police snipers controlled by the regime of then-president Viktor Yanukovych, who days later fled to Russia, fired upon and killed dozens of protesters.	https://kyivindependent.com/iconic-hotel-ukraina-in-central-kyiv-sold-for/	2024-09-18T08:26:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159002883.jpg
Russia's Kursk counteroffensive halted, Kyiv claims	Russia&apos;s counterattack in Kursk Oblast aiming to retake Ukrainian-held territory has been stopped, a spokesperson of the Ukrainian military administration in the region told AFP on Sept. 18. The statement comes a week after Moscow launched a counteroffensive against the western flank of Ukrainian troops in the Russian region. &quot;They tried to attack from the flanks, but they were stopped there,&quot; spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi told AFP. &quot;The situation was stabilized and today everything is under control, they are not successful.&quot; The spokesperson admitted only &quot;some minor successes&quot; by Russia. &quot;The Russians entered one of the settlements. They started fighting for another settlement, but that was it,&quot; he said. Russia claimed to have recaptured 10 settlements only on the first day of the counteroffensive, announcing further advances since then. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early Aug. 6, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). In an effort to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their positions on Russian soil, Moscow&apos;s troops launched a counterattack last week. Russia has not yet commented on Dmytrashkivskyi&apos;s statement but did not mention any new settlements recaptured in its regular update on Sept. 17. Moscow claimed the same day it had repelled several fresh attempts by Ukraine to cross the border in Kursk Oblast west of the Ukrainian salient. The U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its Sept. 17 report that Ukraine carried out ground attacks in the western part of its salient, but neither side achieved confirmed advances. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, there are still &quot;several thousand&quot; Russian civilians in Ukraine-occupied territories of Kursk Oblast. &quot;In some settlements, there are more than 100 people, more than 200, more than 500,&quot; the spokesperson said. Kyiv claimed that its conduct in occupied territories is in line with international humanitarian law and invited the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join the humanitarian efforts.&quot; The Kremlin has denounced the move as &quot;pure provocation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-kursk-oblast-counteroffensive-halted-kyiv-claims/	2024-09-18T08:19:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166251077.jpg
WSJ estimates of Ukraine's casualties 'exaggerated,' lawmaker believes	The Wall Street Journal&apos;s recent claims that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the full-scale war with Russia are &quot;exaggerated,&quot; secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Sept. 18. The U.S. outlet wrote on Sept. 17 that according to a &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year,&quot; Ukraine has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. Russian losses were estimated at 200,000 killed and 400,000 wounded, putting the overall casualties of the war to over 1 million. &quot;I think that these are exaggerated data. Definitely... Namely when talking about the recorded number of (Ukrainian soldiers) killed,&quot; Kostenko said. Ukraine has largely avoided commenting on its losses, though President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed. &quot;If we look at the past two years, we had roughly the same number &#x2013; 19,000 each (year). And this is considering only those who were issued official death certificates,&quot; Kostenko said, adding that many are still considered missing. The lawmaker suggested that 50,000 soldiers killed could be an approximate figure, though he admitted he does not have the most accurate data and that even his number could be an overestimation. Regarding Ukraine&apos;s ability to continue to defend itself despite the losses, Kostenko believes that the country still has enough men to mobilize and that everything depends on the ability to enlist more troops. Ukraine has sought to replenish the ranks of its military as the war has been ongoing for two and half years. Kyiv adopted new legislation on mobilization in the spring, lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 and imposing stricter penalties for dodging draft.	https://kyivindependent.com/wsj-ukraine-kostenko/	2024-09-18T07:42:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151599529.jpg
Armenia uncovers alleged coup plot with Russian traces	Yerevan on Sept. 18 accused five Armenian citizens and two former residents of Nagorno-Karabakh of undergoing military training in Russia in order to stage an armed coup in Armenia. Three suspects have been arrested, while four are still at large, the Armenian Investigative Committee said. The identity of the suspects was not revealed. While the committee did not implicate Russian authorities in the alleged plot, the news comes amid already strained Moscow-Yerevan ties. The suspects were offered a three-month military training on Russian territory for a monthly payment of 220,000 rubles ($2,400). The plans were carried out in cooperation &quot;with other persons whose identity is yet to be determined,&quot; according to the statement. The alleged plotters were to acquaint themselves with &quot;new heavy weapons and learn the skills of their use&quot; as part of their training, the committee said. The suspects then recruited other persons &#x2013; fellow Armenians and Nagorno-Karabakh former residents &#x2013; to join the alleged plot and also undergo training in Russia, according to the statement. This was meant to prepare the recruits to &quot;return to Armenia and remove the current government,&quot; the committee added. Some of the recruits allegedly refused to participate in the training and returned to Armenia, the committee said, adding that an intervention of Armenian law enforcement agencies thwarted the plot. The committee did not specify any political or other affiliations of the alleged plotters, saying that the investigation is ongoing. The authorities are now seeking to identify the remaining accomplices. Prime Minister Nikol Pashiynan&apos;s government previously accused the country&apos;s military of plotting a coup in 2021, months after the unsuccessful war with Azerbaijan in 2020. The prime minister has taken an increasingly pro-Western foreign policy direction as the ties with Moscow, the country&apos;s traditional ally, soured when Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh did not prevent last year&apos;s Azerbaijani offensive. Over 100,000 ethnic Armenians have fled Nagorno-Karabakh in a mass exodus after Azerbaijan seized the region in a lightning military offensive in September 2023. The war sparked mass protests against Pashiynan. Yerevan has been backing the unrecognized republic since its conception in the early 1990s, despite Nagorno-Karabakh being internationally recognized as Azerbaijani sovereign territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/armenia-coup/	2024-09-18T07:09:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1238175830.jpg

Opinion: A sober look at the successors of the Russian 'Empire'	Russian opposition leaders often present themselves as champions of freedom and democracy, and are often embraced as such by well-meaning but sometimes naive Western donors. However, a closer examination reveals that their advocacy largely revolves around maintaining Russia as a unified and powerful state. Far from being proponents of liberal values, these leaders are often pragmatic political operators vying for the position of successor to Russian President Vladimir Putin. They compete for funding and public support, which can lead to violent confrontations, as seen in the recent hammer attack on late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#x2019;s supporters allegedly orchestrated by associates of Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In order to stay relevant, they emphasize protecting the interests of Russia and Russians. &#x201C;There are those who advocate for the urgent &#x2018;decolonization&#x2019; of Russia, arguing to split our vast country into several smaller, safer states. However, these &#x2018;decolonizers&#x2019; can&#x2019;t explain why people with shared backgrounds and cultures should be artificially divided. Nor do they say how this process should even take place,&#x201D; Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny&#x2019;s widow, stated at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia earlier in September. Navalnaya raises a valid point about the lack of a unified strategy among the European Union and its Western allies regarding Russia&#x2019;s future. However, it&#x2019;s hard to overlook her strong endorsement of Russia as a state of consolidated peoples. Her stance on preserving Russia as a &#x201C;great&#x201D; and &#x201C;unified&#x201D; entity reflects a broader trend among Russian opposition figures, as echoed by Khodorkovsky at the &#x201C;Russia Beyond Putin&#x201D; panel at the GLOBSEC conference. &#x201C;It would be a mistake to say that the West is at war with the Russian nation. If the rhetoric claims &#x2018;we are against Russians,&#x2019; the Russians won&#x2019;t care. It is crucial to separate Russian people from Russian decision-makers; we need to say we are at war with Russian decision-makers,&#x201D; Khodorkovsky, formerly the richest man in Russia, said. Endorsing the idea of a unified Russia, even while opposing the Kremlin, ultimately supports the system of oppression that has long subjugated various ethnic groups and regions within its borders. Opposition figures who remain ambivalent about Chechnya, Tatarstan, or Crimea reveal their reluctance to confront the realities of Russian imperialism. While they may criticize Putin&#x2019;s methods, they rarely challenge the underlying notion of a &#x201C;strong&#x201D; and &#x201C;unified&#x201D; Russia, which has persisted long before Putin and will likely continue unless fundamentally confronted. The problem extends beyond Putin and the Kremlin to the broader concept of Russia as an imperial entity, a notion deeply embedded in Russian political culture and perpetuated by both the regime and the opposition. Such positions inherently sustain the oppression of the numerous nations within the Russian Federation, as well as historically and currently abused neighbors. Rather than addressing the fundamental issues, these leaders primarily target Putin and his closest advisors as figureheads. This focus often misleads Western policymakers, who may assume that those fleeing Russia oppose the system&#x2019;s core values. Russian journalist and activist Vladimir Kara-Murza (L) and Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, address a press conference after meeting the Finnish prime minister in Helsinki, Finland, on Sep. 6, 2024. (Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva / AFP via Getty Images)Opposition activities through a political lensTo better understand the Russian opposition in exile, consider that their primary motivation is political competition for leadership as an alternative or successor to Putin. This space is filled with diverse and often contradictory ideologies, from anarchists and fascists to communists and imperial monarchists. Within this environment, the Russian &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; opposition seeks to build broad support, constrained by the conservative and anti-Western attitudes of many Russians. In August 2024, research by the Levada Center revealed that 54% of Russians are satisfied with their lives, and 66% are confident about their future. Interestingly, the highest satisfaction levels are among young people under 24 (75%). Given this context, opposition leaders like Navalnaya and Khodorkovsky must cater to deeply conservative and anti-Western sentiments. They navigate a delicate balance between adopting a liberal fa&#xE7;ade to attract Western funding, while avoiding being outflanked by nationalists &#xA0;like Maxim Katz. They also compete with one another for funds and public support. To remain relevant to the 20-25% of Russians dissatisfied with life, opposition leaders often advocate for reforming, rather than dismantling, the imperial structures of Russia. They focus on corruption, a key weakness of the Russian state, and a point of contention with foreign elites. Similarly, they criticize sanctions, as seen in statements from recently released opposition figures like Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Andrei Pivovarov. Pivovarov, known for his work with Open Russia, frames the struggle as one between the Russian people and the Kremlin, subtly deflecting responsibility from Russian society for enabling the Kremlin&#x2019;s imperial policies. Despite these shortcomings, engaging with the Russian opposition and independent media can provide valuable insights into internal dynamics and FSB activities abroad. They still challenge the Kremlin&#x2019;s monopoly on power and information, potentially limiting its unchecked operations. However, this raises questions about whom to support. Under Navalnaya, the Anti-Corruption Foundation has arguably shifted from a genuine political project to a grant-seeking NGO, which may impact its effectiveness. Moreover, recent internal conflicts, such as the attack on Navalny&#x2019;s aides Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, may deepen divisions within the opposition, shifting focus from political activism to internal disputes. Western governments and civil society organizations might find it more strategic to support regional actors and grassroots movements, like the Free Idel-Ural civil movement, or others that are more attuned to local realities and less prone to centralization issues. Ultimately, the Russian opposition appears less concerned with justice or democratic values and more focused on advocating for the Russian nation under a different guise. Their inclination to prioritize Russia&#x2019;s interests over universal principles of justice suggests that their goal is not the decolonization of Russian politics but the preservation of Russian influence in a more palatable form. If they were truly committed to justice, they would champion the causes of oppressed nations, rather than prioritizing the Russian one.

1 dead, 4 injured after Russian attacks in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast	One person has been killed, and four people, including a nine-year-old boy, have been injured during Russian attacks in the Nikopol district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in southeastern Ukraine, Governor Serhii Lysak said on Sept. 18. The child and two women, aged 43 and 69, were injured during shelling in the city of Marhanets. Lysak earlier reported that a &quot;kamikaze drone strike&quot; in the city of Nikopol had injured a 42-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman. In an update later on Sept. 18, Lysak reported the injured man had died. &quot;Sincere condolences to family and friends,&quot; the governor added. The Russian army regularly fires on the civilian infrastructure of Ukrainian cities, targeting hospitals, among other facilities. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four civilians and injured at least 22 over the previous day, regional authorities reported early on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-dead-4-injured-after-russian-attacks/	2024-09-18T06:52:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-09-18-16_40_53.jpg
Shots fired at Moscow office of Russia's largest online retailer, killing 1, injuring 2	A fight broke out at the head office of Wildberries, Russia&apos;s largest online retailer, killing one person and injuring at least two others, Russian state-controlled news agency TASS reported on Sept. 18. Videos emerged on Telegram on the afternoon of Sept. 18 that showed shots ringing out as a group of men scuffled at the entrance of an office building, purportedly part of the Wildberries headquarters in central Moscow. Wildberries&apos; press service said that the fight broke out when Vladislav Bakalchuk, the estranged husband of the company&apos;s founder, tried to &quot;illegally&quot; enter the building with his security guards. A representative of Vladimir Bakalchuk told Russian news outlet RBK that the businessman had become the victim of a &quot;large-scale provocation&quot; after arriving for negotiations on the construction of warehouses for the retailer on behalf of his company, VB Development. The company&apos;s founder, Tatyana Bakalchuk, said that Bakalchuk had attempted to seize the offices together with another co-founder, Sergey Anufriev, and former chairman of the board of directors, Vladimir Bakin, Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported. &quot;The statement about alleged negotiations, to which an armed group arrived, sounds absurd, since no one agreed on any negotiations,&quot; Tetyana Bakalchuk said. &quot;This is a hostile takeover. Or rather, an unsuccessful attempt,&quot; she said. Tetyana reportedly filed for divorce from her husband in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/shooting-wildberries-office/	2024-09-18T05:07:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996335.jpg
Usyk handcuffed in Krakow airport as 'preventative' measure, Polish border guard says	Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk was detained and briefly handcuffed at Krakow Airport on Sept. 17 as a preventative measure, Polish border guard spokesperson Jacek Michalowski told Polish newspaper Dziennik Polski on Sept. 18. Fellow boxer and Ukrainian MP Zhan Beleniuk posted on social media late on Sept. 18 that Usyk, who became the undisputed heavyweight world champion after defeating British boxer Tyson Fury in May, had been detained. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 18 that Usyk had been released following an intervention by Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry. The incident resulted from &quot;a misunderstanding,&quot; Usyk wrote in an Instagram post after his release. Usyk was reportedly traveling with his coach, Serhii Lapin. Michalowski told Dziennik Polski that &quot;one of the passengers was not allowed to fly, and the other person...said they weren&apos;t going either. However, they didn&apos;t want to leave the gate.&quot; &quot;The handcuffs were put on because of the man&apos;s posture, both men were gesticulating quite a bit because they were unhappy about not flying,&quot; Michalowski said. &quot;Putting on the handcuffs was therefore completely preventive, and they were immediately uncuffed in the service rooms.&quot; Michalowski said Usyk and his companion were detained after they did not leave the gate upon the request of the airport&apos;s security service. &quot;The gentlemen, after receiving a warning in accordance with the regulations, left the rooms at about 10 p.m.,&quot; Michalowski said. Usyk posted on Instagram after his release that he was thankful for the support from Ukrainian diplomats and that he had respect for &quot;Polish law enforcement officers who perform their duties despite their height, weight, arm span, and regalia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/usyk-handcuffed-polish-border-guard/	2024-09-18T04:37:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163300755-1.jpg
IMF reportedly postpones controversial visit to Russia	The International Monetary Fund&apos;s (IMF) planned visit to Russia has been &quot;postponed indefinitely,&quot; Russian state-controlled news agency TASS reported on Sept. 17. News emerged earlier in September that the IMF was preparing to send its first mission to Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The IMF last visited Russia in November 2019, before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The mission was supposed to be headed by Argentine economist Jacques Miniane, with the first part taking place in an online format starting on Sept. 16, followed by a visit to Moscow. Several European countries, including Sweden, Finland, Poland, and the Baltic states, criticized the IMF&apos;s decision to travel to Moscow. Citing two sources, Politico reported that the IMF originally suggested holding the meeting in a third country, but &quot;eventually accepted the Kremlin&apos;s condition to travel to Russia.&quot; The IMF&apos;s Russian executive director, Alexei Mozhin, told TASS on Sept. 17 that the visit had been postponed due to &quot;technical unpreparedness&quot; on the visiting side, but Russia is still ready to accept the visit. Mozhin will be stepping down from his position in November. He confirmed to AFP on Sept. 3 that he will be replaced by Ksenia Yudaeva, former first deputy governor at Russia&apos;s Central Bank and a current adviser to its current governor, Elvira Nabiullina. Yudaeva was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022 for her links to the Central Bank and the Otkritie commercial bank, which was sanctioned by the U.S. on the day the full-scale invasion began. On paper, sanctioned individuals are banned from entering the U.S., where the IMF&apos;s headquarters are located.	https://kyivindependent.com/imf-reportedly-postpones-russia-visit/	2024-09-18T02:47:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
Parliament votes to increase state budget by $12 billion for defense expenditures	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on Sept. 18 in support of increasing the state budget by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) to spend on defense and military needs. In total, 298 lawmakers voted in support of the budget increase, and no lawmakers voted against. &quot;This year&apos;s expenditures amount to a record Hr 3.73 trillion ($89.8 billion),&quot; MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on Telegram. The Verkhovna Rada&apos;s Budget Committee had recommended the draft law on increasing defense spending earlier in September. According to Roksolana Pidlasa, the head of the Budget Committee, the additional $12 billion will mostly be financed through the issuing of domestic government bonds and reducing expenses relating to repaying the state debt. Another Hr 30 billion ($722 million) will come from revenues from tax increases, and Hr 12.7 billion ($305.8 million) will come from an increase in the excise duty on tobacco and fuel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-passes-budget-defense/	2024-09-18T02:20:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170189636.jpg
Russian weapons depot ‘wiped off the face of the earth’ by Ukrainian drone attack, SBU source claims	Ukrainian drones successfully targeted a weapons depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast overnight, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 18. Photos and videos shared on Russian Telegram channels early on Sept. 18 showed a number of explosions and a large plume of smoke purportedly at the site of an ammunition depot in the town of Toropets. Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya reported that a fire had broken out in Toropets due to falling drone debris but claimed the situation was &quot;under control.&quot; Rudenya later announced part of the town&apos;s population would be evacuated from the area where &quot;air defense is operating and the fire is being localized.&quot; According to the source in the SBU, drones from the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, and Ukrainian Armed Forces struck a warehouse storing ballistic missiles, including Iskanders, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery ammunition, and KAB guided bombs. The attack &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth a large warehouse of the main missile and artillery department of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; the source said. &quot;After the arrival of Ukrainian drones, an extremely powerful detonation began&quot; and the affected area is 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) wide, the source said. &quot;The SBU, together with colleagues from the Armed Forces, continues to methodically reduce the missile potential of the enemy, with which it destroys Ukrainian cities.&quot; The source said that there are plans to conduct similar attacks on other Russian military facilities. &#xA0; Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 54 Ukrainian drones had been downed overnight, but did not mention any drones downed over Tver Oblast. According to the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s 8 a.m. report, 27 drones were downed over Kursk Oblast, 16 over Bryansk Oblast, seven over Smolensk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-struck-tver-oblast-weapons-depot-source-says/	2024-09-18T01:12:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/toropets.jpg

The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 46 out of 52 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russia also launched three Kh-59/69 guided air missiles. An attack on Kropyvnytskyi in central Ukraine&apos;s Kirovohrad Oblast killed one person and injured a 90-year-old woman. The woman &quot;received minor injuries&quot; and did not require hospitalization, Kirovohrad Oblast Governor Andriy Raikovych said.

Civilians evacuated amid drone attack in Russia’s Tver Oblast, Russian governor claims	Local authorities have partially evacuated residents of Toropets in Russia&#x2019;s Tver Oblast after a mass drone attack overnight caused a large fire, Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya claimed on Sept. 18. Photos and videos shared on Russian Telegram channels showed a number of explosions and a large plume of smoke, purportedly at the site of an ammunition depot in Toropets. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the location of the explosions. &#xA0; Toropets has a population of 11,000, and is situated around 470 kilometers (292 miles) north of the Ukrainian border and over 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of Moscow. &quot;A fire started as a result of drone wreckage falling while air defense forces were repelling an attack,&quot; Rudenya claimed on Telegram at 3:30 a.m. local time, adding that the situation was under control. At 4 a.m. local time, Rudenya announced the decision &quot;to partially evacuate the population from the territory where air defense is operating and the fire is being localized&quot; as air defense continued to &quot;repel a massive attack of drones in the sky above the city.&quot; &quot;The necessary measures are being taken. The situation is under control.&quot; According to state media outlet RIA Novosti, the population was being evacuated to the town of Zapadnaya Dvina, 35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of Toropets. &#xA0; Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 54 Ukrainian drones had been downed overnight, but did not mention any drones downed over Tver Oblast. According to the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s 8 a.m. report, 27 drones were downed over Kursk Oblast, 16 over Bryansk Oblast, seven over Smolensk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast. Kyiv did not comment on Moscow&apos;s claims, but Ukraine is known to use domestically-produced drones to strike targets deep inside Russia. A previous drone attack on Tver Oblast reportedly targeted a major chemical research plant. Images and videos shared by local residents on Russian Telegram channels appeared to show a large explosion on June 27 near Redkino, home to the Redkinsky plant. At the time, Rudenya only claimed that a drone was downed over Konakovsky district in Tver Oblast, the same area in which the Redkinsky plant is located.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-evacuates-population-in-tver-oblast-claims-mass-drone-attack/	2024-09-17T23:15:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161636670.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 637,010 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 637010 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 18. This number includes 1,130 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Georgian parliament passes anti-LGBTQ legislation	Georgia&apos;s parliament passed a package of anti-LGBTQ laws on Sept. 17 in its third reading. The bills will still need to be signed by pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili to become law &#x2014; but a veto by the president can still be overcome by a subsequent vote in parliament. The package of laws, based around a core bill entitled &quot;On Protection of Family Values and Minors,&quot; was first proposed in March by Mamuka Mdinaradze, the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party&apos;s faction in parliament. It mirrors similar moves in Russia, particularly a decision by Russia&apos;s Supreme Court in November 2023 to declare &quot;the international LGBT social movement&quot; to be &quot;an extremist organization&quot; and ban all its activities. The bills would ban gender transition, adoption by same-sex couples, and forbid gatherings or the distribution of information &quot;aimed at promoting&quot; LGBTQ relationships. After the law was initially proposed, Mdinaradze said it was necessary to &quot;protect society from pseudo-liberal ideology and its inevitable harmful consequences.&quot; Ahead of its passage, a group of 32 civil society organizations released a statement condemning the legislation, saying that it was aimed at &quot;manipulating the public before the elections, covering up real problems, inciting irrational fear, and creating another obstacle on the road to the country&apos;s European integration.&quot; The bills do nothing to address real problems faced by families in Georgia, such as poverty, inflation, and inadequate access to education, the statement said. The statement further called on President Zourabichvili to veto the legislation. It was the latest in a pattern of government measures that aim to restrict the rights of LGBTQ people in Georgia. The previous year, police in Tbilisi failed to prevent thousands of far-right counterprotesters from descending on the capital&apos;s pride festival, resulting in fights and the cancellation of the event. The attack on the pride festival was organized in part by the ar-right and pro-Russian group Alt-Info. Two key members of Alt-Info were sanctioned by the U.S. for human rights abuses on Sept. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-parliament-passes-anti-lgbtq-legislation/	2024-09-17T18:16:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1514301916.jpg
Sybiha to visit Romania in first official trip as Foreign Minister	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha will visit Romania on Sept. 18, paying his first official visit to a foreign state since entering office earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s foreign ministry announced. Sybiha, a career diplomat, replaced Dmytro Kuleba as Foreign Minister on Sept. 5, amid a large-scale reshuffle of the Ukrainian government. &#xA0; According to the ministry, Sybiha will visit Romania to hold bilateral negotiations with his Romanian counterpart Luminita Odobescu and other high-ranking officials. After the negotiations, the ministers will hold a joint press conference. The diplomats will reportedly discuss support for Kyiv&apos;s defense capabilities, Ukraine&apos;s path to membership in the European Union and NATO, &#xA0;and the implementation of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Peace Formula. The negotiations in Bucharest will also focus on Black Sea security and the protection of the legal rights and interests of Ukrainian citizens in Romania. The visit kicks off Sybiha&apos;s regional tour of several neighboring states, the ministry said. The tour is meant to signal Ukraine&apos;s determination to develop a &quot;constructive ... mutually beneficial&quot; relationship with its neighbors. Romania, a NATO member, signed a security agreement with Ukraine in June and has pledged to send Kyiv a Patriot air defense system. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. Russian drone debris has crashed on Romanian soil multiple times.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-to-visit-romania-in-first-official-trip-as-foreign-minister/	2024-09-17T17:16:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170361277.jpg

Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast kills at least 2, injures 5	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Zaporizhzhia Oblast the night of Sept. 17, killing at least two civilians and injuring five others, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Rescue workers are currently searching for people under the rubble, Fedorov said. Earlier in the night, Fedorov reported that explosions had occurred in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Fedorov later said that Russia &quot;massively attacked&quot; the region&apos;s Komyshuvakha community. The attack killed at least two people and injured five. The strike also damaged several homes and an infrastructure facility. Rescue workers are still on site, and the full extent of the damage is still being investigated. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Part of the region is occupied by Russian forces, who are attempting a breakthrough in the country&apos;s southeast. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-kills-at-least-2-injures-5/	2024-09-17T14:45:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/fedorov.jpg
Ukrainian boxer Usyk detained at Krakow airport	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk was arrested at the airport in Krakow, Poland, Ukrainian lawmaker Zhan Beleniuk said on Sept. 17. &quot;Oleksandr Usyk was arrested at the Krakow airport. The circumstances are being investigated,&quot; Beleniuk said via Telegram. Beleniuk also posted video of Usyk&apos;s arrest. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 18 that Usyk had been released following the intervention of Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry. He also said he spoke to Usyk by phone while he was detained. &quot;I was outraged by this treatment of our citizen and champion,&quot; Zelensky said. Usyk&apos;s wife, Kateryna Usyk, wrote on social media that the arrest was not related to anything criminal. &quot;Everything is fine, nothing criminal,&quot; she said. On the instructions of Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine&apos;s Consul General in Krakow went to the airport to intervene on Usyk&apos;s behalf, ministry spokesperson Heorhy Tykhyi said in a statement. &quot;The Ukrainian side categorically rejects the attitude to its citizen and champion demonstrated in the video,&quot; Tykhyi said. Sybiha reportedly appealed to his Polish counterpart to resolve the situation. Usyk became the undisputed heavyweight world champion after defeating British boxer Tyson Fury back in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-boxer-usyk-detained-at-krakow-airport/	2024-09-17T14:09:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1797178122.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 73	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 73 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Sept. 9- Sept. 15, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the final reading draft law #6490-d on restarting the State Customs Service. The text of the draft law #6490-d for the second reading was designed and agreed with all key stakeholders including business associations, NGOs and international experts. The draft law incorporates all provisions on which international partners have insisted and meets all the requirements within the relevant benchmarks of the IMF, the World Bank and the EU (Ukraine Facility). The draft law introduces the transparent competitive procedure for the selection of the SCS head. The competition commission which will select candidates for the SCS head consists of three representatives delegated by the Finance Ministry and three international representatives. International representatives in the competition commission don&#x2019;t have a decisive vote and work under parity principles with Ukrainian members of the commission. The competition commission for selection of the new SCS head doesn&#x2019;t determine the winner, but submits two candidates for consideration to the Finance Ministry. The finance minister makes the final decision regarding the winner of the competition and submits only one candidate to be appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, among other key provisions of the draft law are: The next steps before the draft law comes into effect are signing by the Chair of the Verkhovna Rada and the president of Ukraine. The Tax Committee recommended for the first reading the draft law on increasing taxes. Today the Tax Committee reconsidered draft law #11416-d on tax increase after its rejection in the parliament. The difference in the revised version is just in the provision which raises the bank profit tax rate up to 50%. This provision was previously opposed by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law #11416-d in the first reading during the plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The Budget Committee recommended a draft law with amendments to the State Budget 2024 for the second reading. Last week the Budget Committee recommended for the final reading the draft law #11417 on increasing defense spending by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion). In fact, a reduction of different budget programs by Hr 628 million ($15 million) was added to the second reading. Overall the draft law suggests a reduction of budget expenses by Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion). In particular, Hr 115 billion ($2.8 billion) are savings from the state debt service and Hr 22 billion of other expenses. The Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law #11417 in the final reading during the plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The Parliament will adopt a draft law to restore medium-term local budgets. During plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the second readings draft law #11131 with the amendments to the Budget Code to restore medium-term planning of local budgets. This step is among Ukraine&#x2019;s intentions fixed in the Memorandum with the IMF. As we reported in Issue 63, the draft law restores medium-term planning of local budgets except for temporarily occupied territories or war zones, expands opportunities to use remaining funds, gives right for local councils to provide a financial guarantee for refinancing previously taken loans upon agreement with the Finance Ministry, allows local authorities not to apply the provisions of the Budget Code regarding the total volume of local debt for another six years until 2030. The Verkhovna Rada is going to adopt in the first reading a draft law to reform the Accounting Chamber. This week the Parliament will vote on the first reading of draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber. The draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the ACU&#x2019;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the Accounting Chamber to all public finances, strengthening its independence, reducing a number of the ACU&#x2019;s members from 13 to 11, introducing an external audit with experts with international auditing experience. This week the Parliament will consider several draft laws from the World Bank requirements. During the parliamentary meetings scheduled for Sept, 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada will consider five draft laws which are required by the World Bank. The Parliament will vote on the final reading of the draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies and #11474 to address the issue of privatization of the state banks. The Tax Committee recommended it for the second reading during its meeting on Monday. Moreover, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the final reading draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register and #10143 with the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code which are also obligations to the EU under the Ukraine Plan of Ukraine Facility. Furthermore, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the first reading the new draft law #11520 on public procurements. The Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the parliament the draft law on the State Budget 2025. On Sept. 14, in line with the deadline required by the law, the Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the Verkhovna Rada draft law #12000 on the State Budget 2025. The draft law will be presented in the Parliament during the meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The government expects Ukraine&apos;s GDP to grow by 2.7% (in 2024 it is expected to grow by 3.5%). Inflation at the end of next year is expected to be 9.5% (in contrast with 7.9% this year). The average annual exchange rate in 2025 is expected to be Hr 45 for 1 US dollar. The government left the main social indicators in the budget unchanged: minimum wage at the level of Hr 8,000 ($192) and general subsistence minimum of Hr 2,920 ($70). Budget revenues &#xA0;amount to Hr 2.336 trillion ($56 billion). They are expected to increase by Hr 192 billion ($4.6 billion) or by 9% compared to the 2024 plan. Most of this increase will be provided by revenues from direct taxes &#xA0;by Hr 179.8 billion ($4.3 billion). In particular, personal income taxes should increase by Hr 158 billion ($3.8 billion) and income tax by Hr 21.8 billion ($525 billion). The state budget deficit in 2025 is expected to be 19.4% of GDP or Hr 1.546 trillion ($37 billion). The government is planning to finance it mainly from external sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-73/	2024-09-17T13:22:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg
Italy to deliver promised SAMP/T air defense system by end of September	Italy will deliver a second SAMP/T air defense battery to Ukraine by the end of September, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Sept. 17. Italy promised in June to send Kyiv another SAMP/T system, the only European-made air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles. &quot;By the end of the month the new Samp/T system will be delivered to Ukraine, and we know how much every minute of delay costs,&quot; Crosetto said at a conference on European air defense production, according to the Italian media outlet RAI. The announcement comes over a week after President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Italy on Sept. 6. Zelensky said during the visit that Ukraine is grateful for the air defenses supplied by Western allies, but that they are still &quot;not enough to secure our entire territory and repel every Russian attack.&quot; Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Previously, France and Italy jointly supplied Ukraine with a SAMP/T system back in 2023. Ukraine&apos;s need for advanced air defense systems has become more urgent in light of Iran&apos;s recent transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia. Italian media has also reported that Italy&apos;s next military aid package will include a batch of long-range Storm Shadow missiles along with the SAMP/T system, but officials have not confirmed these reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-to-deliver-promised-samp-t-air-defense-system-by-end-of-september/	2024-09-17T13:08:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251986460.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 147	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 147 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Sept. 8-14, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Former Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO Kudrytskyi interviewed. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, who was dismissed as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO on Sept. 2, was interviewed by Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) this week. We selected the key issues: On dismissal: As we wrote in Issue 55 almost three years ago, there was an attempt to displace or dilute the management of Ukrenergo before the supervisory board was appointed in December 2021 &#x2013; that is, while the Energy Ministry was still exercising the powers of the supervisory board. Back then, the ministry only managed to terminate the powers of two Ukrenergo&#x2019;s executive board members, Andriy Nemyrovskyi and Maksym Yurkov. As we wrote in Issue 103, on Sept. 20, 2023, Ukrenergo reported that the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office searched its head office by order of the Pechersk District Court issued on Aug. 30, 2023. Ukrenergo stated that it would have willingly provided investigators with all the necessary documents without a search, but law enforcers had not requested a voluntary handover. The documents of interest included some contracts that the State Audit Service of Ukraine (SASU) had audited by March 2023. According to liga.net, the search was part of a criminal case opened by the Internal Affairs Ministry on Sept. 16 2023, based on the results of that audit. The said contracts pertained to several companies that supplied goods and services to Ukrenergo in 2019-2023, the media reported. Ukrenergo said that it was challenging the audit results in court, as it considered them &#x201C;biased and unprofessional&#x201D; and &#x201C;some of them directly contradicting the law.&quot; As we reported in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. On the reasons for dismissal: On the protection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s substations: As we wrote in Issue 145, the ostensible reason for Kudrytskyi&#x2019;s dismissal was allegedly insufficient protection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s facilities and, as a result, problems with electricity that arose after a Russian attack on Aug. 26, 2024. On power rationing: As we reported in Issue 145, Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities. Due to the attack, Ukrenergo was forced to introduce power outages. On decentralized generation: On his plans after dismissal: Ten candidates may have applied for the position of PrivatBank&#x2019;s new CEO, Forbes Ukraine wrote. These supposedly include current top managers of PrivatBank and foreign bankers, the media added. According to Forbes Ukraine, several Ukrainians may have applied for the position: All of the above candidates either declined to comment on their possible participation in the competitive selection, neither denying nor confirming it, or did not respond, the media added. Note that disclosing the names of potential CEO candidates would be a poor practice that harms competitive selection. Firstly, the potential employer should ensure the confidentiality of candidates, as applicants would rarely want their current employer to know about their application. Secondly, this information is typically market-sensitive. According to Forbes Ukraine, the following foreign candidates have also applied for the CEO position: It is surprising that Forbes Ukraine chose to discriminate between &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; and &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; candidates. All the &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; candidates listed above also currently have other employers. In addition, one of them, Shevalev, serves as an alternate board director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in London, U.K. &#x201C;I think, this time, there is a request to elect a Ukrainian rather than a foreign CEO,&#x201D; Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source hypothesized. As we reported in late June 2024, Gerhard Bosch filed his resignation as PrivatBank&#x2019;s CEO. See Issue 138 for more detail. As we wrote in September 2024, Bosch&#x2019;s contract would be terminated on Nov. 1, 2024. See Issue 146 for more detail. PrivatBank receives 400 million euros in portfolio guarantees from the EBRD for business lending. On Sept. 11, PrivatBank reported that it signed a risk-sharing agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which would enable the issuance of new loans worth 400 million euros. According to the bank, this agreement includes lending support components: The new financing will increase opportunities for credit support to Ukrainian businesses and expand funding for projects that promote food production, energy efficiency, and energy production, PrivatBank also said. Ukrgasbank raises 150 million euos in EBRD&#x2019;s guarantees to finance investments in energy projects. On Sept. 12, Ukrgasbank reported that it joined the EBRD&#x2019;s Energy Security Support Facility (ESSF) program that would provide better access to finance for energy security investments in Ukraine. EBRD extends a 150 million euros portfolio-risk-sharing facility to Ukrgasbank, which will support its lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, households, municipalities, and medium-sized corporate clients for implementing decentralized energy generation and energy efficiency measures, the bank said. Through the ESSF, the EBRD covers part of the risk of the respective partner financial institutions for investment in decentralized energy generation, Ukrgasbank explained. Ukrnafta earns Hr 10.6 billion ($255 million) in net profit in January-June 2024 (audited). On Sept. 11, Ukrnafta released a statement saying that Crowe Erfolg Ukraine, Crowe Audit &amp; Accounting Ukraine completed its independent audit. Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial statements were not available at the time of writing. In addition, the above statement suggests that Ukrnafta changed its auditor again. Before the company&#x2019;s shares were seized by the state in November 2022, its financial statements were audited by a Big Four firm, PwC. As we wrote in April 2024 (Issue 126), the company&#x2019;s results for 2023 were audited by Grant Thornton, who now appears to have audited Ukrnafta only that year. Ukrnafta also said that it paid Hr 20.2 billion ($486 million) to the state budget in taxes, duties, dividends, and customs payments for the first half of 2024. &#x201C;Since being managed by the state and run by the new management from the end of 2022, the company has received almost Hr 40 billion ($964 million) in profit,&#x201D; Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Sergii Koretskyi said on his Facebook page. To the best of our knowledge, Ukrnafta has never disclosed its financial statements, either audited or unaudited, or other official reporting for 2022 or 2023. As we wrote in Issue 136, Ukrnafta said that it paid Hr 3.5 billion ($84 million) in dividends to Naftogaz, fully covering its dividend obligations for the previous year. In accordance with the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision, Ukrnafta must allocate 30% of its net profit for 2023 in dividends, provided that 50% of the profit is used for capital investments approved by the Cabinet in the company&#x2019;s 2024 financial plan. As we reported earlier, on March 1, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial plan for 2024. Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Serhii Koretskyi then said that Ukrnafta earned Hr 24 billion in net profit in 2023 (around $600 million at the time). See Issue 122 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 115, Ukrnafta paid over Hr 25 billion (around $600 million) in taxes in 2023. As we wrote in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 90, Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial plan for 2023, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, expected Hr 74 billion ($1.8 million) in net income from operations, Hr 12 billion ($289 million) in net profit, and Hr 25 billion ($602 million) in tax payments. As we wrote in Issue 100, in his analysis for Forbes Ukraine, CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s economist Vasyl Povoroznyk contested Koretskyi&#x2019;s statements on the company&#x2019;s quarterly profits, lower costs, higher production, and transparency. He concluded that Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial performance was driven by two factors: higher market prices for petrol and diesel (45% and 54%, respectively) and Ukrnafta&#x2019;s sale of gas which the company received as repayment of part of Naftogaz&#x2019;s historical debt to Ukrnafta. Povoroznyk also said that the financial reporting disclosed by Naftogaz &#x2014; Ukrnafta&#x2019;s majority shareholder who includes Ukrnafta&#x2019;s reporting in its consolidated reporting &#x2014; did not square with numbers named by Koretskyi. In Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized &#x201C;for the needs of the state&#x201D; and transferred to the Defense Ministry on Nov. 6, 2022. After the seizure, the state replaced the supervisory boards and executive management at most of these companies. Former CEO of WOG gas stations chain Serhii Koretskyi became the CEO of both Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta on Nov. 8 and 10, respectively. See Issue 68 for detail. No public statements on the performance of the other company, Ukrtatnafta, audited or unaudited financial statements, or other official reporting for 2022, 2023, or the first half of 2024 are available in the public domain. The ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port fails. According to Prozorro.Sale, an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport, scheduled by the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) for Sept. 6, failed due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 178 million ($4.2 million). This was the ninth attempt to sell the port. According to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. That is, in total, the new owner would have to pay at least Hr 365 million ($8.79 million), CASE Ukraine added. The SPFU scheduled another privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi for Sept. 16. The starting price halved to Hr 89 million ($2.14 million). This suggests that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.22 million) in total. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around $5.3 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest did not pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed. (See Issue 93.)&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port.

Ukraine war latest: 1 million killed, wounded in Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, WSJ reports	Key developments on Sept. 17: Roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17, citing undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates. Kyiv and Moscow have mostly avoided commenting on the casualties their forces suffered during the full-scale war, which has been ongoing for two and half years. A &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year&quot; put Kyiv&apos;s losses at 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded, the WSJ wrote, citing undisclosed sources. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a much lower number of military fatalities in February - 31,000. He did not reveal the number of wounded troops. Western intelligence estimates cited by the WSJ placed Russian losses at up to 200,000 dead and 400,000 wounded. This is close to Kyiv&apos;s estimates on Moscow&apos;s casualties, which is over 635,000 killed and wounded as of Sept. 17. Leaked Pentagon documents reported on by The Economist in July suggested that Russian losses could be even more serious, with the highest estimate standing at 728,000 troops killed, injured, or captured. Moscow has not disclosed its casualties during the war. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian Navy recently carried out a missile strike on ammunition depots near the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a Sept. 17 statement. The strike destroyed both the storage infrastructure and tons of ammunition that Russian troops were stockpiling for use against Ukraine, the Navy said. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled mayor of Mariupol, shared photos showing Russia&apos;s &quot;destroyed warehouses&quot; in the neighboring village of Hlyboke, Donetsk Oblast.. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Mariupol came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people may have been killed during the siege of Mariupol. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher. None of the plans Ukraine is developing to end Russia&apos;s war envisages a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Presidential Office, told Current Time on Sept. 17. Podolyak&apos;s statement echoed a recent comment of Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dismissed Bild&apos;s article saying that Kyiv was allegedly ready to freeze the conflict as part of its &quot;Victory Plan&quot; as &quot;fake.&quot; &quot;(Freezing of the conflict) will not lead to the end of the war but will only lead to Russia gaining the opportunity to accumulate additional resources and proceed to the third stage (of the war) with more mass killings of civilians in Ukraine,&quot; Podolyak said. &quot;There are no concepts of ceding territories, there are no concepts of freezing the conflict,&quot; he added. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected any ceasefire or temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces. Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast were part of his &quot;Victory Plan.&quot; The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine&apos;s participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details. Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) by Russia. On the morning of Sept. 17, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription &quot;For Kursk&quot; appeared on social media. Remnants of gray tape are visible on the soldier&apos;s hand. The photo appears to show a bloodied body lying on the road against the backdrop of damaged vehicles and a house with broken windows. The exact location is unclear. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the photo. &quot;The level of barbarism and bloodthirstiness is impossible to comprehend,&quot; Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel. The ombudsman stressed that such actions are a flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Later in the day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that the alleged execution of a &#xA0; Ukrainian soldier took place in the town of Novohrodivka in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have not yet established the time when the alleged execution took place. The investigation is ongoing to establish the circumstances and identify the people responsible for the crime. The pre-trial investigation is conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine&apos;s (SBU) investigators in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. As of September, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said 28 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 62 Ukrainian POWs. Russian forces attacked the city of Kharkiv with guided aerial bombs on Sept. 17, injuring at least seven people, local authorities reported. The city&apos;s Kyivskyi district came under attack, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Four first responders are among the injured, he said. Sept. 17 marks Rescuer&apos;s Day in Ukraine. Another two civilian men, aged 19 and 25, also suffered injuries, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In an interview with the Ukrainian media Interfax, the head of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service Andrii Danyk said that as of July, 93 emergency workers were killed and almost 400 wounded since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-29/	2024-09-17T12:20:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598-1.jpg
Trump assassination attempt suspect has no ties to Ukrainian institutions, Kyiv says	The suspect in the second assassination attempt on former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump has no ties to Ukrainian institutions, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said at a briefing on Sept. 17. The U.S. Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate. The suspect detained in connection to the attack was identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. Based on his social media activity, Routh has cast himself as a supporter of Ukraine and spoke to the New York Times in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight for Kyiv. Tykhyi reiterated that the suspect has never fought for Ukraine as a member of the International Legion or other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces. &quot;We can see from the news reports that the suspect previously publicly supported Ukraine, but there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States who support Ukraine and clearly diverse groups of individuals,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;We urge everyone to refrain from artificially linking the suspect&apos;s actions to Ukraine.&quot; Following the incident, President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the assassination attempt on Trump, saying that &quot;the rule of law is paramount and political violence has no place anywhere in the world.&quot; Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump. There are fears that Routh&apos;s apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Multiple reports indicated that Russia would seek to interfere in the upcoming vote by backing Trump and turning the American public against supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-assassination-attempt-suspect-has-no-ties-to-ukrainian-institutions-kyiv-says/	2024-09-17T12:11:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
Trump Jr. urges Biden to negotiate with Moscow after Putin's nuclear saber-rattling	Donald Trump Jr. and former U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. opposed permitting Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range missiles, calling on the Biden-Harris administration to negotiate with Moscow. In a joint op-ed published by The Hill on Sept. 17, the two cited Russia&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling rhetoric and recent comment by Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that lifting restrictions on long-range strikes would mean NATO being &quot;at war&quot; with Moscow. Russia has consistently issued threats, including nuclear ones, since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but none of them have materialized. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. Trump Jr., the son of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump, and Kennedy Jr., who suspended his presidential campaign this summer and endorsed Trump, claimed that lifting restrictions &quot;would put the world at greater risk of nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis.&quot; The two urged U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, to focus on &quot;finding a diplomatic off-ramp&quot; to Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump and Kennedy also rejected the threat of Moscow&apos;s attack on other European countries in the future, saying that Russia &quot;can barely wrest a few provinces from Ukraine.&quot; The opinion comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to present his &quot;Victory Plan&quot; to Biden and other leaders later this month, which reportedly doesn&apos;t envisage a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow. &#xA0; Trump has repeatedly promised to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine within 24 hours if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Harris pledged to support Ukraine while Trump refused to answer whether Ukraine&apos;s victory was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was &quot;in the U.S.&apos;s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. Negotiate a deal.&quot; Kyiv has said it aims to invite Russia for an upcoming second peace summit, though Moscow has shown no interest in accepting the invitation. Kyiv&apos;s 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country. Russia named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-son/	2024-09-17T11:53:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161883147.jpg
Russia claims Ukraine made new attempts to break into Kursk Oblast	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Sept. 17 that it had repelled Ukraine&apos;s new attempts to cross into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast west of the currently controlled territories. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, reportedly seizing around 100 settlements and 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. The Ukrainian positions in the region are now threatened by a Russian counterattack launched last week. Commenting on Russia&apos;s counterattack, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that &quot;everything was going according to our plan&quot; and that Russia&apos;s &quot;rapid&quot; offensive had not yet achieved &quot;serious&quot; success in the area. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine attempted to attack in the direction of the villages of Veseloye and Medvezhye, about 25 kilometers west of the currently-held territories in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has not commented on these claims, which cannot be verified independently. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine. Before the Kursk operation, the most intense Russian assaults were observed in Donetsk Oblast, primarily near Pokrovsk. While the Russian offensive on Pokrovsk has slowed down after the launch of the Kursk incursion, heavy fighting continues in other sectors of the front in Donetsk Oblast, including near Vuhledar. Russia has also intensified its attacks on bordering Sumy Oblast, which the military considers to be a response to Kyiv&apos;s success in the Kursk operation. In addition to pushing Russian troops away from the border, Ukraine has reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Russia&apos;s region as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-ukraine-made-new-attempts-to-break-into-kursk-oblast/	2024-09-17T09:55:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg

According to Zelensky, the plan is over 90% complete, and Kyiv is preparing to present it to allies next week. Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its first global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was not invited. Kyiv has said it aims to invite a Russian representative to the second conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/none-of-ukraines-plans-to-end-the-war-envisages-ceasefire-ceding-territory-podolyak-says/	2024-09-17T08:23:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2164069605.jpg
Why Russia still rakes in cash transporting gas through Ukraine: What to know in 4 key charts	While Russia&apos;s deadly war rages on Ukraine&apos;s soil, one unexpected aspect of the invasion is that natural gas continues to flow through Ukraine from Russia, with both sides profiting from the deal and &#x2013; to an extent &#x2013; financing each other&apos;s war machines. That is expected to change when their deal expires at the end of the year. Russia has been paying Ukraine transport fees to carry its gas through thousands of kilometers of underground Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 agreement between the two countries. Russia then rakes in billions of dollars of profits selling the gas to European partners. While Ukraine had the right to halt its gas deal by invoking a &#x201C;force majeure&#x201D; clause when the war broke out and deprive Russia of billions of dollars of funding for its war, doing so would have severely hurt Ukraine&#x2019;s allies and likely created a major energy crisis felt around the world. Instead, Ukraine has emphasized to its partners that it does not plan to renew the deal past its 2024 expiry, giving them time to find and negotiate alternative sources of energy. It is also working to secure a separate deal to use its pipeline network to bring gas to Europe from Azerbaijan. Many European countries have already sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas because of the war, but the region still imports significant volumes of Russian gas to meet its energy needs. The gas agreement and its vulnerabilities again came to the forefront in the wake of Ukraine&#x2019;s invasion of Kursk &#x2013; the remaining border location where gas enters Ukraine from Russia and the site of a critical metering station. Both Russia and Ukraine make money off the deal &#x2013; though Russia&#x2019;s revenues from selling gas to Europe far outweigh Ukraine&#x2019;s income from the gas transport fees. Infographic showing the amounts of the EU&apos;s Russian gas that travels through Ukraine. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The former head of Ukraine&#x2019;s gas pipeline operator, GTS Operator, estimates that Russia earns around $5 billion a year from the deal, while Ukraine received $800 million in 2023. The former GTS Operator head, Serhii Makohon, added that the majority of this $800 million was spent on maintaining and operating the transit, leaving around $100-$200 million left in revenues for Ukraine&#x2019;s budget. Bloomberg has estimated Russia&#x2019;s revenues higher, at $6.5 billion dollars a year. The original agreement guaranteed $7 billion for Ukraine over 5 years, but Russia reduced its gas volumes and payments to Ukraine in 2022 after the invasion shut down one of the routes into Ukraine through occupied territory. Russia rebuffed Ukraine&#x2019;s offer to reroute the volumes through open pipelines. In response, Ukraine&#x2019;s state gas company opened up an arbitration case for late and insufficient payments. &#xA0;Ukraine did not say how much Russia had underpaid. European partners also benefit from the deal, receiving relatively cheaper Russian gas transported over land rather than by sea. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has roiled the natural gas markets, with key events causing large spikes in Europe&#x2019;s natural gas prices and contributing to rising living costs in Europe. Key events during Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine have shocked the European natural gas market. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Who buys the gas?Central and Western European countries have been relying on Russian natural gas for decades, with the recent Ukraine deal from 2019 only the latest in a series of agreements. The full-scale Russian invasion marked a turning point, forcing an unprecedented shift in Europe&#x2019;s energy policy. Europe is now &quot;fully committed&quot; to phasing out Russian gas, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11, and is &quot;ready to live without this Russian gas coming from the Ukrainian transit route.&#x201D; With European countries taking steps to diversify their energy sources and reduce their dependence on Russia, the share of Russian gas among EU natural gas imports dropped from 45% in 2021 to 15% last year. Infographics of quarterly EU natural gas imports by source. Russian gas has dropped from 45% of EU imports to 15%. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The sharp drop in demand from European buyers has led to Russia&#x2019;s energy giant Gazprom posting its largest losses in 25 years &#x2013; with a $5.5 billion loss in the first half of 2024. While most European nations with maritime access have shifted to buying more liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports arriving by boat, landlocked countries in Central Europe, like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria, face more challenges. Austria imports the highest share of Russian natural gas of any EU country, hitting a record of 98% in December 2023 and fluctuating above 80% in recent months. The country has pledged to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. Russian natural gas made up 82% and 85% of natural gas imports in Hungary and Slovakia in the first four months of 2024, respectively, according to a report from Fitch Ratings. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s government, in contrast with the EU position, has defended the continued use of Russian gas, claiming stable Russian supplies are an economic imperative. European countries have also reduced their overall gas consumption. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, it has decreased by 20% since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Despite these reductions, the EU still remains Russia&#x2019;s largest export market for natural gas. Some countries still have contracts with Russia to purchase their gas beyond 2024 and will need to break or find other ways to fulfill the contract, potentially importing Russian gas through the Turkstream route. Gas used to enter Ukraine from two points along the Russian border &#x2013; from the North through the metering station in Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, and from the East through the Sokhranivka metering station, near the border with Luhansk. Map of key gas pipelines from Russia to Europe. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, key gas pipeline routes have been shut down. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Because of the heavy fighting, shelling, and subsequent occupation in parts of Luhansk, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas operator, GTS Operator, has not been able to operate at the Sokhranivka entry point. It declared a force majeure event in May 2022, halting the flow of gas along that route and rerouting spare capacity through the Sudzha entry point in Kursk. At the time, about a third of gas from Russia to Europe flowed through the Sokhranivka route. &#xA0; Since then, the route through Kursk has been the only entryway into Ukraine across the Russian border. The Nord Stream pipeline, which delivered gas from Russia to Germany, used to carry the largest volumes of Russian gas to Europe of the pipelines. During the course of the war, Russia reduced volumes in transit by Nord Stream, eventually halting them altogether, claiming it was forced to do so in response to sanctions. Germany&#x2019;s largest gas importer, Uniper, was awarded billions in damages from Gazprom in arbitration in June for Russia&#x2019;s failure to deliver on its contracts. After volumes stopped pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline, saboteurs damaged the pipelines in 2022. German authorities issued an arrest warrant last month for a Ukrainian national in connection to the explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines, according to media reports. Kyiv has repeatedly denied connection to the Nord Stream blasts. The Polish section of another route for Russian gas &#x2013; the Yamal route &#x2013; was shut down in 2022 after Poland and Bulgaria refused Russia&#x2019;s demand to pay for the gas in rubles. Russia had wanted payment in rubles in response to Western sanctions imposed because of its invasion. The Ukraine pipelines may soon be filled with gas from Azerbaijan, replacing the Russian supplies. The Azeri gas would travel through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. &#x201C;Naftogaz will not extend the transit agreement with Gazprom. We are not conducting negotiations and do not plan to,&#x201D; said Oleksii Chernyshov, the CEO of Naftogaz, Ukraine&#x2019;s national energy company, in a July interview with Liga.net. &quot;We are looking for alternative solutions. For example, we have been approached by businesses from Azerbaijan, particularly Socar. But we don&apos;t have a ready-made solution yet. It is too early to talk about it,&#x201D; Chernyshov said. On Sept. 6, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev confirmed that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv about a potential deal. &#xA0; &#x201C;For several months we have been making great efforts to come to a common denominator,&#x201D; Aliyev said.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-russia-still-rakes-in-cash-transporting-gas-through-ukraine-what-to-know-in-4-key-charts/	2024-09-17T08:18:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
‘A wave of lawlessness’ – returning from war in Ukraine, Russian convicts commit crimes at home	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story contains graphic descriptions. Several months after Russian Sergei Kozlov, an assault fighter of the infamous Wagner Group, returned home from the war in Ukraine, he violently killed his 18-year-old partner Daria, who was pregnant with his child. She was beaten to death, suffering a traumatic brain injury, a broken nose, a liver rupture, and a closed abdominal injury &#x2013; the description of all 138 injuries took several pages in the case file, Russian state-controlled media outlet Kommersant reported on Sept. 4. On Sept. 9, the Russian Omsk Oblast Court convicted Kozlov of murder and sentenced him to 19 years behind bars. But this was not his first time in prison. In 2021, Kozlov was found guilty of severe and minor bodily harm and was supposed to serve 6.5 years in prison. But he was soon recruited by the Wagner mercenary group to join Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. For his combat achievements, Kozlov was even awarded the medal &quot;For Courage,&quot; Kommersant wrote. &#xA0; Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war since the summer of 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner Group and later under the Russian Defense Ministry. As of October 2023, Russia has reportedly recruited about 100,000 prisoners. Initially, prisoners, even those convicted of violent crimes, were promised a pardon after completing a six-month military contract. Since January, Russian army recruits drawn from prisons no longer receive pardons but are released on parole, and are expected to fight until the war is over. &#xA0; Russian POWs are seen living in a prisoner of war detention camp lining up for a meal in the cafeteria in the Lviv region, Ukraine, on Aug. 3, 2023. (Paula Bronstein /Getty Images)But as many of the convicts have already returned home under the previous conditions, reports of their new crimes appear to be increasing in Russia. Since the start of the year, Russia has seen a record number of grave crimes in the past 13 years &#x2014; more than 403,000 &#x2014; the Russian Verstka media outlet reported, citing the Russian Interior Ministry. &quot;Among the factors influencing the growth of crime, the Interior Ministry pointed to the war in Ukraine and the return of former prisoners from the front line,&quot; the outlet wrote. Over the past two years, at least 107 people have been killed, and another 100 have been seriously wounded by Russian war veterans returning from the front line in Ukraine, Verstka said in its investigation published in April. The majority of the victims were killed by ex-convicts, the outlet wrote. Mikhail Savva, a legal expert from the Center for Civil Liberties, believes that the current situation in Russia can be described as a &quot;wave of lawlessness&quot; and the &quot;degradation of legal culture.&quot; But the return of ex-convicts is not the only reason, Savva says. &quot;Aggression against an independent state is forbidden by international law. So many people in Russia understand that their government violates everything that can be violated,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Because it is precisely through the disregard for the law that people get the idea that anything is possible.&quot; &#xA0; The building of the Government of Moscow is seen with the illumination of &quot;Z,&quot; a symbol of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Earth Hour in Moscow, Russia, on March 26, 2022.

(Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)According to Savva, the high number of crimes committed by convicts returning from the front line is mainly because Russia recruits prisoners convicted of nearly all types of crimes. Only those convicted of terrorism, extremism, and sexual crimes against minors are forbidden to be recruited, Savva says. However, most of the verdicts on extremist or terrorist charges in Russia are simply falsified, as the Kremlin uses them to imprison those protesting against its regime, he adds. &quot;Hence, murderers, serial killers, and others can join and stand under the Russian army flag.&quot; In May, the Moscow Times reported that Russian cannibal Dmitry Malyshev, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and several other serious crimes, joined one of Russia&#x2019;s Storm V penal military units. Malyshev was reportedly recruited to the army together with serial killer Aleksandr Maslennikov, sentenced to 23 years in prison for the &quot;double murder and dismemberment of women.&quot; In late August, multiple Russian media outlets reported that a former Wagner mercenary, Ivan Rossomakhin, convicted of several crimes, had signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry and returned to the war in Ukraine. Rossomakhin was recruited by Wagner Group in September 2022 while he was serving a 14-year term for murder and theft. By the end of his military service, he was pardoned by Putin, according to Current Time, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty project. Then in 2023, upon returning from the war in Ukraine, he raped and killed an 85-year-old woman. While serving his 23-year sentence, Rossomakhin reportedly joined the Russian army again.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images).Reports of Russian soldiers committing crimes against Ukrainian prisoners of war have also recently increased, with several cases of alleged execution brought by Ukraine to the attention of international organizations. Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war with a sword. However, according to Savva, the rise in violence and brutality by Russian troops toward Ukrainians, including prisoners of war, is only partly due to the large number of convicts in their ranks. &quot;The reason is not that there are many convicts in the Russian army, but that the army is fighting in conditions where war crimes are the norm. In the Russian army, (war crimes) are not subject to punishment. They do not prohibit it,&quot; Savva says. In May, Ukraine also began allowing convicts to enlist in the army. However, the eligibility requirements for these prisoners are more stringent compared to those in Russia. Those serving for premeditated murder, the murder of two or more people, sexual violence, drug production, and crimes against national security are not eligible to enlist. &quot;There are limitations based on the severity of the crimes,&quot; Savva says. &quot;In Ukraine, for instance, serial killers remain in prisons, unlike Russia.&quot; He says the whole recruitment process is different, too. Russia does it &quot;en masse,&quot; and most of the convicts have joined the Storm V penal military units. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, different brigades recruit prisoners to fight alongside their other soldiers, which also helps their socialization, Savva says. While Ukraine has said it&apos;s looking to recruit a total of 20,000 convicts, over 10,000 convicts signed up in Russia last April alone, the U.K. Defense Ministry reported. &quot;What we are witnessing now in the Russian army is the degradation of it as an institution of order,&quot; Savva says.

Russian attack injures 4 first responders in Kharkiv, as Ukraine marks Rescuer's Day	Russian forces attacked the city of Kharkiv with guided aerial bombs on Sept. 17, injuring at least six people, local authorities reported. The city&apos;s Kyivskyi district came under attack, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Four first responders are among the injured, he said. Sept. 17 marks Rescuer&apos;s Day in Ukraine. Another two civilian men, aged 19 and 25, also suffered injuries, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In an interview with the Ukrainian media Interfax, the head of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service Andrii Danyk said that as of July, 93 emergency workers were killed and almost 400 wounded since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion. Attacks against population centers in Kharkiv Oblast intensified after Russia launched a new cross-border offensive in the northern part of the region in May. While the push has been halted by Ukrainian troops, Russian troops continue to hold a handful of settlements just across the border. In one of the recent attacks, Russian forces hit an apartment building in Kharkiv on Sept. 15, killing a 94-year-old woman and injuring over 40 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-injures-4-first-responders-in-kharkiv-as-ukraine-marks-rescuers-day/	2024-09-17T06:43:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1233096956.jpg
Too dangerous to ignore' – Russia's malicious activity in the Baltics set to test NATO resolve	&#x201C;Russian intelligence is everywhere. And its propaganda is everywhere, not only in Estonia but all over the world,&#x201D; Estonian President Alar Karis told the Kyiv Independent during an interview on the sidelines of the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in Kyiv. Russia has been actively meddling in the domestic affairs of the Baltic states. An Estonian professor was arrested by the Estonian Internal Security Service (ISS or Kapo) in January 2024 on suspicion of being a Russian spy and later sentenced to six years in prison. Meanwhile, Moscow has also been ratcheting up tensions in the Baltic Sea. GPS jamming, disappearing buoys and an aborted &quot;ocean-grab&quot; are just some of the recent events that are raising concerns about the Kremlin&apos;s intentions in the region. &quot;Things are coming to the surface again in a very dramatic way at the moment,&quot; Elisabeth Braw, a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, tells the Kyiv Independent. A draft decree posted on the Kremlin&apos;s website on May 21 declared Russia would be unilaterally redrawing the maritime border with Lithuania and Finland in the Baltic Sea. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the draft decree vanished on May 22. There has been no public explanation from the Kremlin as to why it was taken down, but Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis described it as &quot;an obvious escalation against NATO and the EU.&quot; The map of the Baltic Sea region. (The Kyiv Independent)A day after the draft decree disappeared, so did buoys on the Narva River which mark the separation of Russian and Estonian territory. Both countries agreed on the buoys&apos; location in 2022, but the Kremlin then backtracked and disputed the placement of more than half of the 250 markers, which Russian border guards unilaterally began removing on May 23 without providing an explanation. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas described it as a &quot;border incident&quot; and said it was being investigated. &#x201C;You see quite a lot of change in the Baltics. We are trying to convince our people to spend more on defense, to build up factories, to cooperate more with Ukraine, and to learn everything that we can because we feel that if Ukraine is unable to stop the Russians, then the Russians will not stop, and then who knows what will happen next,&#x201D; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview. The Latvian defense minister shared a similar concern. &quot;We are in a hybrid conflict right now,&quot; Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 23. &quot;Unfortunately, this is the neighbor we are facing,&quot; he added. Russia has been suspected of intentionally jamming the GPS systems aboard commercial aircraft for more than a decade, but incidents over the Baltic Sea region have skyrocketed in recent months. According to a report by The Sun in April based on data from the website GPSJAM.org, some 46,000 aircraft have reported problems over the Baltic Sea since the previous August, with most of them occurring in Eastern Europe near borders with Russia. Some incidents have resulted in aircraft having to turn around mid-flight, and even a plane carrying the U.K. defense secretary has been targeted. Describing the phenomenon earlier this year, Landsbergis said it was &quot;getting too dangerous to ignore.&quot; While it&apos;s almost impossible to definitively prove who is responsible for the GPS jamming, a jammer blocks a signal from the point where it is deployed up to a distance of 350 kilometers for some military-grade models. This photograph shows a boat in the Baltic sea on a surveillance camera of the French navy patrol airplane Atlantique 2 on mission above the Baltic Sea on June 16, 2022. (Fred Tanneau / AFP via Getty Images)This means in order to block GPS signals over the Baltic Sea, the jammer would have to be located in one of the countries surrounding it. Unless NATO countries are engaging in self-sabotage, this leaves one obvious candidate &#x2013; Russia. The Baltic states have also been actively countering a variety of other attacks, including cyber. &#x201C;We have been prepared for cyber-attacks for quite a long time because they started in 2007. We also start to convince also Western parties that this is a very important issue,&#x201D; President Karis told the Kyiv Independent. Back in May, an ominous warning was issued by NATO&apos;s newest member, Sweden. Micael Byden, the supreme commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, said Putin may be seeking dominance over the Baltic Sea and has his eye on the Swedish island of Gotland. Located around 330 kilometers (around 200 miles) north of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, Gotland is Sweden&apos;s largest island, and its central location means it is of vital strategic importance in the Baltic Sea. &quot;Who controls Gotland controls the Baltic Sea,&quot; said Byden. NATO military exercises in the Black Sea in June were another reminder of how much things have changed in a short time. Twenty NATO member states, including the recently added Sweden and Finland, put forward 9,000 troops, 50 ships, and 45 aircraft to take part in the drills. As well as having direct access to the Baltic Sea through its most eastern arm in the Finnish Gulf, Russia also has the exclave of Kaliningrad, a small piece of land sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base in Kaliningrad, with another base in Baltiysk. Western analysts have described the size and power of the Baltic Sea Fleet as &quot;somewhat limited,&quot; and when Russia conducted military exercises in the Baltic Sea in August 2023, around 30 warships and boats were set to take part, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. But that&apos;s not all Russia possesses in Kaliningrad. &quot;Kaliningrad is essentially a Russian weapons depot, and it has a lot of militarily operational equipment in use, not just in storage,&quot; Braw said. According to a December 2023 article by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia has amassed a &quot;formidable&quot; arsenal of weapons in the exclave in recent years that includes &quot;cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and nuclear weapons.&quot; Without a direct line to the Kremlin, it&apos;s impossible to know for certain, and expert opinion varies from an escalating hybrid war to an outright intention to invade the Baltic states &#x2013; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The top officials from all three states are well aware of such a possibility. &#x201C;When we add up the number of troops, missiles, tanks, and money, Russia is nowhere near the power that it was during the Soviet Union when it could match NATO,&#x201D; Landsbergis told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In real military scenarios, it&apos;s incomparable. NATO could overwhelm Russia.&#x201D; &#x201C;But the Russians are not counting on that. They are counting on &#x2013; how they explain it to themselves &#x2013; &#xA0;democratic weakness, inability to make decisions, differences in opinions,&#x201D; he added. Throughout 2024, Western and NATO officials have been sounding the alarm on Russia&apos;s expansionist ambitions beyond Ukraine. Denmark&apos;s Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Feb. 9 Russia could attack a NATO country &quot;within a three&#x2013;to five-year period.&quot; A top German general a day later said Germany should be prepared for a war with Russia within the next five years. And a senior Estonian official told the Financial Times (FT) in the same month that Russia&#x2019;s &quot;intent and capability&#x201D; to attack a NATO country before the end of the decade was &quot;pretty much consensus&quot; within the military alliance. If accurate, a simple matter of geography puts the Baltic states in the crosshairs of these future scenarios.

(Narciso Contreras/Anadolu via Getty Images)While on paper, NATO is far more powerful than Russia, Dr. Jan Kallberg, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, Washington D.C., and a fellow at the Army Cyber Institute at West Point, said the Kremlin could be relying on an inefficient and incoherent response from the military bloc to offset this. &quot;They maybe think the Western leadership isn&apos;t tough enough to stand up when things really hit the fan,&quot; he tells the Kyiv Independent, adding: &quot;They might think that they can act quickly and the West won&apos;t have the time to do force generation in the area and they can, with little means, just capture the Baltics and the West faces a fait accompli.&#x201D; &quot;Their bet is that the Western leadership would cave in,&quot; Kallberg said. Two days after Kallberg spoke to the Kyiv Independent, a Russian think tank with a large influence on Kremlin policy said Moscow should consider a &quot;demonstrative&quot; nuclear explosion to dissuade the West from allowing its weapons to be used to strike inside Russia. Such a nuclear scenario is, according to some Western officials, already enough to worry the U.S. to the point where Washington has taken preemptive steps to prevent it. &#x201C;Russia knows very well that it&apos;s not the only nuclear power in Europe and in the world. I don&apos;t think we are going to test a nuclear attack on any country,&#x201D; President Karis said, however. Latvian Foreign Minister Spruds is also measured in his assessment, saying that for Latvia and the other Baltic states, it&apos;s &quot;nothing new for us.&quot; &quot;For us, there is no need to panic because we&apos;ve been used to hybrid activities already for years,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;It&apos;s cyber attacks, it&apos;s weaponization of illegal migration, it&apos;s disinformation campaigns, it&apos;s some incidents against critical infrastructure. &quot;So we&apos;ve seen it, and we are experiencing it permanently.&quot; As alarming as the prospect of further Russian invasions, naval assaults, and &quot;demonstrative&quot; nuclear explosions are, Braw cautions against getting too wrapped up in looking for outright signs of military aggression. &quot;Frankly, I don&apos;t think taking over the Baltic states is Russia&apos;s first objective,&quot; she said. &quot;If you invade a country, if you break it, you own it &#x2013; and occupying and administering occupied territory is extremely cumbersome, as Russia is seeing in Ukraine. I think weakening them, destabilizing them, and making them in many ways failed states is more what Russia wants,&#x201D; Braw added. Braw points to things like GPS jamming forcing and the mysterious disappearing decrees on maritime borders as actions designed to waste the time and resources of the Baltic governments and &quot;making them uncertain about what&apos;s next.&quot; A Russian naval ship takes part in the rehearsal of the Naval Parade in the morning in St. Petersburg in the Gulf of Finland on July 21, 2024. (Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;And this is intended to create a sense of paranoia and inferiority where you eventually say, &apos;we just have to live with a great deal of Russian influence in the region,&#x2019;&quot; she added. Braw also points out that there is little NATO can do about such things as it&apos;s only set up to respond to overt military aggression. &quot;The Russians have been imaginative before, this is what they&apos;re good at,&quot; she said. &quot;They think of different ways of harming other countries, achieving their goals, and they do it underneath the threshold of Article 5, which means the affected countries struggle to respond.&#x201D; Kallberg agrees that if the situation in the Baltic Sea escalates further, whatever comes next won&apos;t be an outright declaration of war but something designed to test NATO&apos;s response. &#x201C;For us, it&apos;s very important to keep this transatlantic bond. As far as defense (goes), the U.S. should be number one (leading) in this case,&#x201D; President Karis said.	https://kyivindependent.com/too-dangerous-to-ignore-russias-malicious-activity-in-the-baltics-set-to-test-nato-resolve/	2024-09-17T06:39:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162291001.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian ammunition depots near occupied Mariupol, Navy says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The Ukrainian Navy recently carried out a missile strike on ammunition depots near the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a Sept. 17 statement. The strike destroyed both the storage infrastructure and tons of ammunition that Russian troops were stockpiling for use against Ukraine, the Navy said. Mariupol came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people may have been killed during the siege of Mariupol. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-russian-ammunition-depots-near-russian-occupied-mariupol/	2024-09-17T06:05:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-15_49_47.png
Brazil cannot take part in Russia-Ukraine war,' Lula says after Zelensky's criticism	Brazil cannot interfere in the Russian-Ukrainian war, and those who want to engage in a dialogue with the Brazilian government should have done so before the war, Brazil&apos;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Sept. 16, Metropoles reported. The South American country has positioned itself as neutral in the war, refusing to join sanctions or provide military aid while proposing a peace initiative in cooperation with China. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Brazil&apos;s and China&apos;s joint plan, calling it &quot;destructive.&quot; &quot;You either support the war, or you don&apos;t support the war. If you don&apos;t support it, then help us stop Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. The president added that he offered to discuss peace proposals with Chinese and Brazilian leaders. Lula gave a speech during the graduation ceremony for diplomats at the Rio Branco Institute and, without explicitly mentioning Zelensky&apos;s recent statement, said that &quot;those who want to talk to us now could have done so before the war started.&quot; &quot;Brazil has never been so important in the world as now. It&apos;s not just because of agriculture business, it&apos;s not just because of iron ore, it&apos;s not just because of soy or meat. It&apos;s because Brazil is an unbeatable country when it comes to energy,&quot; Lula said. &quot;That&apos;s why it&apos;s important for Brazil not to take part in the war in Ukraine and Russia, that&apos;s why it&apos;s important for Brazil to say that we want peace, we don&apos;t want war. Those who want to talk to us now could have talked to us before the war started,&quot; he added. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Brazil&apos;s president was a far-right politician and Lula&apos;s rival, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula took office in January 2023, when the all-out war had already lasted for almost a year. Prior to that, Lula was head of the Brazilian state from 2003 until 2011, three years before Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the partial occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by Russian forces. In May, Brazil and China pitched a six-point peace plan that called on both Russia and Ukraine to avoid &quot;escalation of hostilities&quot; and &quot;provocations.&quot; It came as a parallel plan to Ukraine&apos;s peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which included a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite the invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. The six-point plan from Brazil and China calls for: Moscow has previously said it would accept Brazil and China as intermediaries for possible peace talks. While the two countries refused to publicly take sides in the war, China served as Russia&apos;s key economic lifeline and a source of dual-use goods. There have been no direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since early 2022. Moscow named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks. In turn, Kyiv&apos;s 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/brazil-cannot-interfere-in-russia-ukraine-war-lula-says-after-zelenskys-criticism/	2024-09-17T05:59:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170682594.jpg
Ukraine's parliament backs major tax hike in first reading	Ukraine&apos;s parliament approved on Sept. 17 a bill that proposes a tax increase of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025. The draft law was introduced to the parliament as the country struggles to shore up its budget deficit amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war. The bill would increase the military tax from 1.5% to 5%, set higher taxes for self-employed persons, impose a 50% tax on bank profits in 2024, and 25% tax on the profits of other financial institutions. The parliament failed to gather enough votes to pass the initial version of the bill on Sept. 3, which was meant to bring an additional Hr 30 billion ($720 million) to the state budget. Only after the revision by the parliamentary tax committee did enough lawmakers &#x2013; 241 &#x2013; support the bill. Before becoming law, the legislation must pass a second reading and be signed by the president. After passing, the law will have to be antedated to Oct. 1 as it is unlikely to be approved until later in October, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in August that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though foreign partners have pledged to cover roughly $20 billion of that sum. Kyiv has grown increasingly reliant on external sources of financing, such as grants and loans from the EU, the U.S., the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other partners as Russia&apos;s war continues to put heavy strain on the country&apos;s economy. The proposed tax increase is part of an effort to find additional sources of funding at home, which may also include increased domestic borrowing and measures to boost the number of jobs and wages. Despite the dire budgetary situation, the bill has received criticism due to its potential repercussions on already difficult living conditions in the country. The ZN.ua media outlet conducted a survey in July that showed that around 32% of Ukrainian families have enough money only to buy food, while 9% said they even struggle to buy groceries. The population&apos;s economic hardships are further compounded by the physical danger of Russian attacks and blackouts caused by Russia&apos;s drone and missile campaign against energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-backs-major-tax-hike-in-first-reading/	2024-09-17T05:36:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
Von der Leyen names new European Commission with pro-Ukraine figures leading diplomacy, defense	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen officially announced on Sept. 17 the composition of the EU&apos;s executive arm as the bloc seeks to better respond to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and other global challenges. Von der Leyen, winning her second five-year term in the June elections, has proven to be a vocal supporter of Ukraine during the full-scale war, which is reflected in her picks for key Brussels jobs. For the first time in history, the European Commission will include the position of defense commissioner. Former Lithuanian Prime Minister and Member of the European Parliament Andrius Kubilius will take up the new post overseeing the EU&apos;s defense policy. Von der Leyen said the commissioner will &quot;work on developing the European defense union and boosting our investment in industrial capacity.&quot; Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine revealed serious deficiencies in the European defense industry as EU countries struggled to provide Kyiv with sufficient arms and munitions. Croatian MEP (Group of the European People&apos;s Party (Christian Democrats) - Hrvatska demokratska zajednica) Dubravka Suica (L) and the Lithuanian Member of the European Parliament (Group of the European People&apos;s Party (Christian Democrats) - Tvyns sjunga-Lietuvos krikionys demokratai) Andrius Kubilius (R) are listening during the hearing of the European Commissioner-designate for neighborhood and enlargement policy, Oliver Varhelyi while he is answering questions during his hearing at the European Parliament on Nov. 14, 2019, in Brussels, Belgium. ( Thierry Monasse/Getty ImagesKubilius, who headed Lithuania&apos;s government between 1999-2000 and then again between 2008-2012, has been an outspoken supporter of Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Moscow. Speaking to the European Parliament on Sept. 17, Kubilius said that the EU needs &quot;to radically ramp up production of our military industry and to integrate Ukraine&apos;s military industry with the European one.&quot; &quot;And we need to remove any red lines in the defense of Ukraine,&quot; he added. One of the most senior positions in the commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, was given to former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The Estonian politician will replace Josep Borrell, who headed the EU&apos;s diplomacy since 2019. Kallas&apos;s appointment was long expected after she stepped down from the Estonian government in July. Leading the Baltic country at the Russian border from 2021 until 2024, Kallas advocated for more decisive measures by the West to help Ukraine fend off Russia&apos;s aggression.

Kallas also argued for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO and supported Paris&apos;s proposal of deploying Western military trainers on the ground. Another appointment that will be crucial for Ukraine is Slovenia&apos;s Marta Kos, who was nominated to replace Hungarian Oliver Varhelyi as the enlargement commissioner. Kos will be responsible for the EU&apos;s Eastern neighborhood policy and &quot;will work on supporting Ukraine &#x2013; and continuing the work on reconstruction, and support candidate countries to prepare them for accession,&quot; von der Leyen said. Kos, whose final appointment is still awaiting a non-binding decision by the national parliament, previously served as ambassador to Switzerland and Germany. Experts told the Kyiv Independent in June that a potential replacement of the Hungarian commissioner, whose homeland has repeatedly obstructed Kyiv&apos;s membership efforts, could signal a more positive outlook for Ukraine&apos;s accession. Varhelyi remains in the EU&apos;s executive as the health and animal welfare commissioner. Two of the commission&apos;s new executive vice presidents are Spain&apos;s Teresa Ribera Rodriguez, who is in charge of climate and competition policy, and Finland&apos;s Henna Virkkunen, who is overseeing tech sovereignty and security, underscoring the European Commission&apos;s focus on climate and innovation. Other new appointments include ex-French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne leading the bloc&apos;s industrial strategy, Latvia&apos;s Valdis Dombrovskis overseeing economy and productivity matters, Poland&apos;s Piotr Serafin in charge of budgetary issues, and Slovak diplomat Maros Sefcovic overseeing trade policy, among others.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-names-new-european-commission/	2024-09-17T04:35:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2158998528.jpg
Russia striking Sumy Oblast due to Kyiv's successes in Kursk incursion, Ukraine's military says	The Russian military is striking Sumy Oblast because of Ukraine&apos;s successes in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Sept. 17. The statement came after Russia launched a heavy drone attack on the northeastern Ukrainian region, disrupting electricity and water supplies. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast have escalated since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into the neighboring Kursk Oblast in early August. Mysnyk nevertheless said that Russian strikes on Sumy Oblast would have continued even if Ukraine had not successfully advanced in the Kursk sector. While Russia has ramped up attacks against the region since August, Sumy Oblast has been shelled on a daily basis since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of time before they dump all this (all the weapons) on us. Either here (in Sumy Oblast) or in another city. But they will strike at Ukraine with everything they have, using the entire arsenal,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;They (Russia) see our successes in the Kursk operation &#x2013; and we are close to them &#x2013; so there is probably some fear that we will somehow operate in other cities on the border,&quot; he added. Mysnyk also noted that the Russian military had reduced the number of mortar attacks on the border of Sumy Oblast and stopped attacking Kharkiv Oblast with aerial guided bombs. This may indicate that Russia&apos;s resources are &quot;not unlimited,&quot; he added. Russia recently launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, seeking to dislodge Ukrainian troops from its soil. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that &quot;everything was going according to our plan&quot; and that the Russian &quot;rapid&quot; offensive had not yet achieved &quot;serious&quot; success in the area. Ukrainian soldiers also have reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-sumy-oblast/	2024-09-17T04:03:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241400.jpg
‘It’s personal’ — Why Germany still refuses to send Taurus missiles to Ukraine	While Washington and London are facing pressure to allow Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia using the Western-made missiles already in the country, Berlin declines to even provide such missiles. &#x201C;Germany has made a clear decision about what we will do and what we will not do. This decision will not change,&#x201D; Scholz said on Sept. 13, remaining adamant in his refusal to provide the country&#x2019;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. His remarks came after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian soil during their meeting in Washington. In the spring, Washington confirmed that it had begun providing Ukraine with long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). Kyiv had previously received missiles that could travel up to 160 kilometers, and the new batch consisted of advanced ones with a range of up to 300 kilometers. But Berlin&apos;s transfer of Taurus missiles did not follow. Prior, Germany followed the U.S. lead in handing over the first Patriot air defense system in early 2023 and the long-anticipated battle tanks. When Kyiv launched a surprise incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, the operation received endorsement from Berlin. Germany&#x2019;s Defense Ministry said Ukraine is &#x201C;free to choose&#x201D; the weapons to use inside Russia for self-defense in compliance with international law. Yet, Berlin continues to hold off Ukrainian requests to provide the last piece of the puzzle, the missiles that can target the Russian military in the rear. A TAURUS (Target Adaptive Unitary and dispenser Robotic Ubiquity System) KEPD 350 air-launched cruise missile is on display during the press presentation at the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld, near Berlin, Germany, on June 3, 2024. (Ralf Hirschberger /AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;&quot;A nightmare scenario for Scholz is that Ukraine would use Taurus to strike politically sensitive targets inside Russia. Scholz fears that this could escalate the war and throw Germany into direct hostilities with Russia,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, who specializes in missile technology, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this spring. &#x201C;Fundamentally, this means that Scholz is restrained by a lack of political will, which stems from a lack of trust in Ukrainian leadership to not break any promises.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Germany&#x2019;s refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles is linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling. &#x201C;As I understand it, the chancellor says that Germany is not a nuclear state and that this (Taurus missiles) is the most powerful weapon system in Germany,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s president said in an interview with Bild. In his recent comments, Putin claimed that giving Ukraine the green light to use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean NATO was &quot;at war&quot; with Moscow. Russia has been constantly issuing threats that have failed to materialize. Designed to hit buried and protected targets, such as command posts and bridges, the Taurus cruise missile can hit targets 500 kilometers away, outmatching the capabilities of other Western long-range systems that Ukraine has in service. Apart from ATACMS, Ukraine received the British Storm Shadow missiles, along with the French equivalent, the SCALP missiles, which have a range of up to 250 kilometers. The arsenal helped Ukraine hit Russian targets in the occupied territories, including Crimea.

(Attila Husejnow/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. Berlin seems to not care. Among the reasons Scholz gave for not providing Ukraine with long-range missiles was the alleged inability to use them without the German soldiers&apos; involvement, which was refuted. &#x201C;At this point, it has even become what you might call a personal issue of the chancellor,&#x201D; Jessica Berlin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said. &#x201C;There&apos;s a personal element involved in the other political considerations. That is not the only driver of the decision, but is certainly playing a role.&#x201D; According to a German general, who was not authorized to speak to the press, providing the Taurus missiles to Ukraine is solely a political decision, and the German Armed Forces don&apos;t object to the decision being made. A year before the German parliamentary elections, the majority of Germans support Scholz&apos;s decision not to provide Ukraine with Taurus missiles. An April poll by Forsa Institute, requested by the German RTL television channel, showed that only 37% of Germans back the Taurus deliveries to Kyiv, while 56% oppose such a move. At the same time, according to a February poll by the ZDF TV channel, 62% of Germans favor European countries providing Kyiv with more weapons and ammunition, while 32% oppose it. Jessica Berlin said that German support for the provision of Taurus has been slipping in the polls, partly due to a lack of decisiveness, clarity, and political leadership. This creates a ripe environment for Russian propaganda and narratives around &#x201C;escalation,&#x201D; for which there is no German strategy to counter effectively, according to the expert. &#x201C;If the German public understood fully the nature of the situation and the nature of the threat we face from Russia, they would be less fearful of helping Ukraine&apos;s self-defense with German hardware, and they would understand that investing in Ukraine&apos;s defense is also investing in Germany&apos;s defense.&#x201D; Christian M&#xF6;lling, a security expert at the Germany-based Bertelsmann Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent that &#x201C;people basically have given up on arguing for Taurus.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-send-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-scholz-says-why/	2024-09-17T04:03:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171104834.jpg
Around 1 million killed, wounded in Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, WSJ reports	Roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17, citing undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates. Kyiv and Moscow have mostly avoided commenting on the casualties their forces suffered during the war, which has been ongoing for two and half years. A &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year&quot; put Kyiv&apos;s losses at 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded, the WSJ wrote, citing undisclosed sources. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a much lower number of military fatalities in February - 31,000. He did not reveal the number of wounded troops. Western intelligence estimates cited by the WSJ placed Russian losses at up to 200,000 dead and 400,000 wounded. This is close to Kyiv&apos;s estimates on Moscow&apos;s casualties, which is over 635,000 killed and wounded as of Sept. 17. Leaking Pentagon documents reported on by The Economist in July suggest that Russian losses could be even more serious, with the highest estimate being 728,000 troops killed, injured, or captured. Moscow has not disclosed its casualties during the war. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Both Ukraine and Russia have sought to replenish the ranks of their militaries as there appears to be no end of the war in sight. Kyiv adopted new legislation on mobilization in the spring, lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 and imposing stricter penalties for dodging draft. In turn, Russia carried out a partial mobilization in September 2022 and, according to Ukraine&apos;s intelligence, continues &quot;covertly&quot; drafting roughly 30,000 troops every month. Moscow primarily targets residents of economically weaker regions and migrants rather than men from wealthy urban centers to avoid discontent and an economic downturn. The war brought a demographic shock to both countries, already struggling with population growth. An estimated 14 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, including nearly 6.5 million who fled or were forced out abroad. Around 650,000 Russians have permanently relocated abroad since the start of the invasion in 2022, motivated by fears of draft or opposition to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/wsj-ukraine-russia-losses/	2024-09-17T03:06:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1474875794.jpg
Germany pledges over $110 million in winter aid for Ukraine	Germany will provide an additional 100 million euros ($111 million) in aid to Ukraine this winter, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced during a visit to Moldova on Sept. 17, Reuters reported.Russia is once again planning a 'winter war with the aim of making the lives of people in Ukraine as terrible as possible,' Baerbock said before a ministerial conference in Chisinau.Ukrainians have been living with intermittent power outages throughout the summer and autumn since Russia stepped up its campaign of strikes against energy infrastructure.Serhiy Kovalenko, the CEO of energy supplier Yasno, warned in June that Ukrainians may have electricity for just 6-7 hours per day in the winter, depending on how much of the grid can be repaired.Ahead of the coming winter, Ukraine has ensured that 85% of its energy infrastructure is protected against further Russian attacks, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 10.Shmyhal said it is impossible to predict how many hours of blackouts Ukrainians will endure during the winter.According to the prime minister, the Ukrainian government has allocated Hr 19 billion ($461 million) for the protection of energy facilities, and another Hr 13 billion ($315 million) has been provided by foreign partners.'A near-death feeling:' Largest-yet Russian attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure brings back widespread power outagesViktoriia Skyba, a 29-year-old mother of two, didn't have the time to reach a bomb shelter when Russia attacked her town during what Ukrainian officials have said is the largest attack on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion.

Syrians disappear in Luhansk Oblast' — Ukraine's intelligence says Moscow uses foreign fighters as cannon fodder	Russia is luring men from Syria to use them as cannon fodder in battles in Ukraine's east, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Sept. 17.Throughout the full-scale war, Moscow has been using various schemes to enlist migrants and foreign nationals to offset the heavy losses it had suffered during the invasion while avoiding full mobilization.Syria, a country ravaged by civil war and largely ruled by the Kremlin's ally Bashar al-Assad, is one of the key targets of these efforts.'Russia has established a scheme with travel companies to recruit Syrians for the war against Ukraine. First, poor people are offered jobs as security guards in Russian oil regions, and then they are lured with a higher salary' to fight the war against Ukraine, HUR said on social media. Syrian nationals are also promised Russian passports. Сирійці зникають на Луганщині ― росіяни посилають іноземних найманців у м'ясні штурми  Держава-агресор росія продовжує практики 'жуковщини', використовуючи іноземних найманців у війні проти України як гарматне м'ясо.  https://t.co/uvrnjzrugJ pic.twitter.com/vHRijUaj1y— Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 17, 2024 Syrian mercenaries are then reportedly used as cannon fodder in mass infantry attacks and are being rejected evacuation when wounded. As an example, HUR presented the stories of Mohammed Mansour and Wahid Mursal Al-Shibli, two Syrian mercenaries fighting for Russia.As part of a squad of 14 other Syrians, Mansur was deployed in an attack near Svatove in Luhansk Oblast in July. After coming under Ukrainian fire, Russia rejected the mercenaries' request for evacuation and ordered them to press the attack, HUR said.Mansur allegedly refused to obey the order and fled the battlefield, while the rest of his unit dispersed and is now considered missing.Al-Shibli was deployed in Luhansk Oblast as a member of a seven-member squad. He was injured in battle and died as he was not evacuated, HUR caimed.The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims.Some third-party countries have taken steps to prevent their citizens from dying on Ukrainian battlefields. India has reached a deal with Moscow to dischrage its nationals from the Russian Armed Forces, while Nepal stopped issuing work permits for Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-syrians/	2024-09-17T01:55:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239490221.jpg
Opinion: IMF's trip to Moscow is effectively enabling Russia's war against Ukraine	You probably haven't heard that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is preparing to send a mission to Russia. That's because top IMF officials have been trying to draw as little public attention to their plans as possible - which ought to tell you something. Fund officials themselves know that this is a scandal in the making.The IMF is about to send its first official mission to Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The visit later this month, which is to be led by Deputy Head of Division Jacques Miniane, marks a quiet but significant shift in the Fund's approach toward Russia. Western nations previously pressured the IMF to drop the idea of sending missions in 2022 and 2023. Now, the IMF is reengaging with Moscow, despite Russia's continued war in Ukraine.This decision is a big diplomatic win for the Kremlin, even if the IMF is acting as though it's business as usual. The Fund has tried to keep the mission low profile: we know about it mainly because of an incidental remark made to Reuters by the head of the IMF's Russia department.A terse IMF press release went largely unnoticed by the media.The IMF claims to be outside politics, but its actions show a blatant disregard for international law and human rights. The invasion of Ukraine isn't a matter of policy debate—it's a crime. By engaging with Moscow now, the IMF sends a message that Russian actions can be overlooked.This isn't neutrality; it's complicity.Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and the IMF leadership are detached from the brutal realities of the ongoing war. They are focused on a vision for a postwar order in which peace and stability prevail. But this vision is built on arrogance—the belief that Fund bureaucrats understand the future better than anyone else.In reality, by attempting to move toward normalization, they strengthen Russia today, prolonging the war and emboldening future aggressions.The IMF sees Russia's war on Ukraine as irrelevant to its policy mandate. Yet the war can't be ignored even if one insists on viewing economics in isolation from everything else: Russia's aggression is reshaping Europe's economy and destabilizing global markets.By choosing to look away from this grim reality, the Fund is effectively enabling Russia's actions.IMF to send its first delegation to Russia since full-scale invasion's start, Russian representative claimsThe last IMF mission to Russia was in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. 'We were excluded from this process under pressure from our Western 'friends,' and there were no further missions in 2022-23,' the IMF's Russian Executive Director Aleksei Mozhin said.The Kyiv IndependentNate OstillerThe mission to Moscow sends a clear message: Russia can count on the IMF's support even as it continues its war.The IMF's job is to promote global economic cooperation and stability, not to ensure the financial stability of an aggressor state. If it acts to boost Russia's economy, the IMF will be advancing Moscow's ability to keep the war going.The only way to bring this war to a just end is by crippling Russia's war machine. The rest of the international community—minus the Fund, apparently—understands this well.That's precisely why western governments have put so much effort into imposing a vast array of sanctions on Russia. Undermining the Russian economy is precisely the point. (It speaks volumes, by the way, that Aleksei Mozhin, the current Russian executive director of the IMF, is set to be replaced by ex-central bank official Ksenia Yudaeva, who has been under U.S. sanctions since April 2022.)In its reports, the IMF prefers to avoid blaming Russia for the direct effects of its invasion: economic shocks in Europe, soaring food prices in Africa, and the suffering of millions of people.As for Ukraine itself, it's estimated that repairing the damage from Russia's unprovoked invasion will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The IMF's reluctance to confront these facts is nothing short of a lie.Rest assured that the Kremlin will make the most of the mission. Russian officials will hug and smile for the cameras, detailing every minute of the visit. They will cite it as proof that the war is as good as over, that Russia has been forgiven by the West, and that Ukraine no longer matters.Explainer: Ukraine's $15 billion IMF loan programMaxwell Kushnir is a research analyst at the IMF.

Russia's invasion has caused untold devastation acros...The Kyiv IndependentMaxwell KushnirTo Russia, this is more than a financial review—it's a geopolitical victory. The IMF's actions will be spun as a signal that the West and the U.S. have written Ukraine off, leaving Russia powerful, prosperous, and influential.This mission sends another clear message: the man U.S. President Joe Biden once called a war criminal, Vladimir Putin of Russia, will now receive the imprimatur of one of the world's most reputable Western institutions. This is a diplomatic and moral disaster.The world cannot afford to let the IMF continue down this path of appeasement. The Fund must be held accountable for its actions. It cannot turn a blind eye to Russian atrocities while claiming to work toward global economic cooperation and stability.By normalizing relations with Russia, the IMF is doing more than just engaging in technical assessments—it is enabling a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and destabilized the world economy.If the IMF wants to live up to its mission of promoting monetary cooperation, trade, and economic growth, it must stand against Russia's aggression, not facilitate it.Estonian President Karis: We have to cross all 'red lines,' then start forcing Russia out of UkraineEstonian President Alar Karis is very diplomatic.

Ukraine appeals to UN, Red Cross over Russia apparently executing POW with sword	Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) by Russia.On the morning of Sept. 17, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription 'For Kursk' appeared on social media. Remnants of gray tape are visible on the soldier's hand.The photo appears to show a bloodied body lying on the road against the backdrop of damaged vehicles and a house with broken windows. The exact location is unclear.The Kyiv Independent could not verify the photo.'The level of barbarism and bloodthirstiness is impossible to comprehend,' Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel. The ombudsman stressed that such actions are a flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. As of September, the Prosecutor General's Office said 28 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 62 Ukrainian POWs.In early September, Lubinets reported another case of the alleged execution of a Ukrainian soldier, which was recorded on video.The footage allegedly showed a Russian soldier who asks a Ukrainian military service member if he wants to 'say the last word, pray before dying,' and then shoots him with a rifle three times.Russian POWs speak about their capture in Kursk OblastThe Kyiv Independent got exclusive access to the POWs captured during the Kursk operation and interviewed them about their motivations and experience of fighting for Russia.The Kyiv IndependentOlena Zashko	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsman-appeals-to-un-red-cross/	2024-09-17T01:39:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1246182421.jpeg
EU preparing to raise up to 40 billion euros in loans for Ukraine without US, FT reports	The EU is preparing plans to gather up to 40 billion euros ($44.5 billion) in loans for Ukraine as Budapest keeps disrupting plans on a joint loan with the U.S., the Financial Times reported on Sept. 16, citing sources and a draft proposal.The Group of Seven (G7) agreed in June to provide Kyiv with a $50 billion loan covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets, to be delivered by the end of the year. The plan envisaged the U.S. and EU both covering $20 billion, with the remaining $10 billion to be provided by the U.K., Canada, and Japan.The G7 countries have immobilized almost $300 billion in frozen Russian assets at the start of the full-scale invasion, with roughly two-thirds being held in the EU.Washington's condition was the EU extending the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. The European Commission proposed to move from the usual six-month-rolling basis to 36 months to provide stronger safeguards.The FT wrote that Hungary has vetoed this step, hoping to push the final decision beyond the U.S. presidential election in November.While the commission prefers the joint loan with U.S. participation, Brussels must start working on an alternative as the relevant powers expire by the end of the year, the outlet reported.Such a proposal includes the EU raising between 20 billion euros ($22.3 billion) and 40 billion euros, with the final figure to be set after consultations between the commission and member states, officials told the FT. This move would require only majority support, circumventing Hungary's veto.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, seen as the most Russia-friendly EU leader, has repeatedly obstructed sanctions against Moscow and aid to Kyiv, claiming the West only prolongs and escalates the war.Orban has maintained close relations with Republican candidate Donald Trump, a fellow right-wing populist who promised to end the war 'within 24 hours.' Statements from Trump's inner circle indicate this could entail pressing Ukraine to give up on its NATO aspirations, or, allegedly, to cede territory Ukraine grows increasingly reliant on external financing as Russia's war puts ever stronger pressure on its economy. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the country faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though partners have committed to cover roughly $20 billion.Trump's 'peace plan' could include creation of demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine, Vance saysDonald Trump could bring Russians, Ukrainians, and Europeans to the negotiating table to 'figure out what a peaceful settlement looks like,' according to J.D.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, including child, injure 9 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two and injured nine people over the past day, local authorities reported on Sept. 17.Ukrainian air defense shot down 34 of the 51 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight on Sept. 17, according to the Air Force. Twelve Russian drones were 'lost' on Ukrainian territory, likely as a result of electronic warfare means, while the other two returned to Russia, the statement read.Ukrainian forces used aircraft, mobile fire groups, anti-aircraft missile troops, and electronic warfare units to repel the air attack. Air defense systems were active in Kherson, Sumy, Poltava, Mykolaiv, and Kharkiv oblasts.In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces attacked 10 settlements over the past day, including its regional center, the city of Kherson.

Doctors Without Borders closes programs in Russia	Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian organization that focuses on providing medical aid in conflict zones, announced on Sept. 16 that its programs in Russia will be closed.Doctors Without Borders has been working in Russia since 1992. For 32 years, the organization has been engaged in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis and HIV, assistance to the homeless, and humanitarian aid in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan.The organization said that throughout the full-scale invasion, it was providing assistance to Russian citizens affected by Moscow's war in Ukraine and to Ukrainian citizens 'who crossed into Russia from Ukraine.' Nearly 1.3 million displaced Ukrainians have been registered in Russia as of December 2023, with the U.N. expressing 'concerns regarding their legal status, rights, and access to services within the country.' Research by Amnesty International showed that 'many displaced Ukrainians end up inside Russia or Russia-occupied territories involuntarily, even if they are not physically forced to move.'Doctors Without Borders said it was carrying out this work 'in partnership with local NGOs in the Belgorod and Rostov regions in the south of Russia.'The reason for the closure was that in August, the organization received a letter from the Russian Justice Ministry with a decision to exclude the affiliate office of the non-profit association 'Doctors Without Borders'(Netherlands) in Russia from the register of affiliate and representative offices of foreign NGOs, the statement read.'It is with a heavy heart that we have to close our activities in Russia. Our organization's work is guided by independence, impartiality, neutrality, and medical ethics. We provide assistance based on the needs,' said Yashovardhan, head of the Russian programs.The reason for the Justice Ministry's decision to exclude the organization's branch was not specified.The register shows only two branches of the organization as of Sept. 15, 2024: 'Doctors Without Borders' (Belgium) and 'Doctors Without Borders' (France). The first was removed from the register in 2009, while the second one, listed in 2006, has no removal date. The affiliate 'Doctors Without Borders'(Netherlands) was de-registered in July 2024.'We are very sad to conclude our programs in the country as many people in need of medical and humanitarian assistance will now be left without the support we could have provided them. Doctors Without Borders would like to still work in Russia again, if and when possible,' Norman Sitali, operations manager responsible for programs in Russia, said.Doctors Without Borders was founded in 1971 by a group of French doctors and journalists to help people in war zones, epidemics, and natural disasters. Since then, the organization has been present in more than 70 countries.Doctors Without Borders says office in Donetsk Oblast 'bombed and completely destroyed'Doctors Without Borders, an international medical humanitarian organization that provides help in conflict zones, reported on April 5 that its office in Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast was 'bombed and completely destroyed.'The Kyiv IndependentDinara Khalilova	https://kyivindependent.com/doctors-without-borders-russia/	2024-09-16T23:41:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1258499796.jpg

Meta blocks Russian state media across its platforms amid 'foreign interference activity'	U.S. tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, announced a global ban on Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya, citing their involvement in covert influence operations.This move escalates the company's previous actions, which had focused on limiting the reach of these outlets and blocking their ads.The ban will be enforced across Meta's platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, over the next few days.The decision follows U.S. charges against RT employees for alleged efforts to influence the 2024 election, with Meta stating that Russian state media has a history of using deceptive tactics online.Earlier in September, the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on supposed Russian election interference, seizing 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns and sanctioning several high-profile propagandists working for RT.Alongside the new warning about RT, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that 'the State Department also designated the Russian state-funded and directed media company Rossiya Segodnya and five of its subsidiaries, including RT, under the Foreign Missions Act.'Kremlin propagandist attacked in Russia, possibly killed, Ukraine's intelligence reportsThe Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine's military intelligence for confirmation of who was behind the attack.

As FIDE considers lifting sanctions, Ukrainian chess community calls for continued ban on Russian and Belarusian players	A group of 13 Ukrainian chess players has sent a letter to the International Chess Federation (FIDE), urging the continued ban on Russian and Belarusian players from competitions due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.They argued that lifting sanctions on these federations would be 'premature and deeply immoral given the ongoing circumstances.'Their appeal comes ahead of the FIDE General Assembly on September 22 in Budapest, where the assembly is set to consider the possibility of lifting the ban imposed on Russian and Belarusian players after February 2022.'We respectfully urge you to ensure that this topic is not even placed on the agenda for discussion,' the players wrote, calling for global solidarity with the Ukrainian chess community.This letter follows a similar call from Oleksandr Kamyshin, the president of the Ukrainian Chess Federation.FIDE has barred Russian and Belarusian flags from its events, but allowed players from Russia and Belarus to participate under the neutral FIDE flag.Toronto Film Festival resumes 'Russians at War' screening, ignoring widespread criticismAfter announcing on Sept. 12 that screenings of the controversial documentary 'Russians at War' would be paused due to 'significant threats to festival operations and public safety,' the film is set to return to the Toronto International Film Festival's lineup on Sept. 17.

Kazakh President Tokayev says 'Russia cannot be defeated'	Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Astana on Sept. 16 that 'Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense.'Despite Astana's historically close ties to Moscow, Tokayev has taken a cautious approach to the full-scale war, refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories in 2022. At the same time, Kazakhstan has declined to abandon its long-standing relationship with Russia. 'It is a fact that Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense,' Tokayev told Scholz, in what was one of the clearest examples of Kazakhstan's pragmatic approach to Russia amid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 'A further escalation of war will lead to irreparable consequences for the whole of humanity and above all for the countries involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,' Tokayev added. The Kazakh president also expressed support for a Chinese-Brazilian peace plan first pitched in May, which was dismissed by Scholz.In an interview earlier in September, President Volodymyr Zelensky called the six-point plan 'destructive' and characterized it as a 'political statement.'Kazakhstan has been an increasingly important player in the region amid Russia's deteriorating relations with the West and has been accused of being a key transit intermediary for sanctions evasion. Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin said in August that Kazakhstan will not 'blindly follow the sanctions' if they affect domestic Kazakh companies. The Kazakh government has sought concessions from the West to allow for trade with Iran or to use the country for transit, but has been unsuccessful. According to Zhumangarin, Kazakhstan does not acknowledge any unilateral sanctions and intends to move forward with its domestic trade agenda regardless of the West. While visiting Germany in October 2023, Tokayev said that Kazakhstan would continue its economic cooperation with Russia while promising to adhere to the sanctions imposed on its northern neighbor.Russia, West fight for Kazakhstan as Astana plays both sidesOn the surface, Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to Kazakhstan on Nov. 9 exuded an air of business as usual.

US announces sanctions against Georgian officials for human rights abuses	The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Sept. 16 a new tranche of sanctions targeting Georgian officials and two private citizens characterized as 'extremists' for their role in human rights abuses. 'Today's action underscores our concern about the consequences of anti-democratic actions in Georgia and efforts by key individuals to use violence and intimidation to achieve their aims,' said Treasury official Bradley Smith.Concerns about Georgia's democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as 'foreign agents' and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics.The U.S. previously announced travel restrictions in May for Georgian officials deemed to be responsible for 'undermining democracy' in the country. The latest round of measures was targeted at officials and citizens associated with 'violently suppressing the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly of Georgians engaged in the democratic process and peaceful expression.'It was the first tranche of sanctions that explicitly targeted officials by name. The Treasury Department specified that the abuses occurred during the historic protests that continued for months against the passage of the foreign agents law earlier in 2024. The violence against protesters was directed by Georgia's Interior Ministry and 'overseen by the Chief of the Special Task Department, Zviad Kharazishvili, and his Deputy, Mileri Lagazauri,' the Treasury Department said. Kharazishvili, known popularly in Georgia as Khareba, 'is well known for his punitive actions against political opponents and has been personally involved in the physical and verbal abuse of protestors.'Aside from the officials, the Treasury Department also announced sanctions against two private citizens, Konstantine Morgoshia and Zurab Makharadze, associated with the far-right and pro-Russian group Alt-Info, perhaps best known for organizing violence against the country's LGBTQ community. 'The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior,' the Treasury Department said.

Up to each NATO country to decide policy on Ukraine's long-range strike capabilities, Stoltenberg says	Each NATO country will be able to make an individual decision on whether to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons for long-range strikes into Russia, outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with the U.K.'s LBC Radio published on Sept. 16. 'It's for the individual allies to make these decisions, but it's important that we consult closely on these issues as we do,' Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory.Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made.As the discussions on the issue appeared to be closer to reaching a change in policy, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have upped their rhetoric, claiming that such a move would mean that NATO is directly at war with Russia. Stoltenberg acknowledged the threats but said, 'There are no risk-free options in war.''But I continue to believe that the biggest risk for us will be if President Putin wins in Ukraine,' he added. Saber-rattling aside, some NATO countries have already begun to alter their stance on long-range strikes in recent days. The Guardian reported on Sept. 11, citing unnamed U.K. officials, that the British government had already made a positive decision regarding the usage of its Storm Shadow missiles ahead of a joint trip by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy to Kyiv.Other countries, such as Sweden, Finland, and Canada, have also come out to say they fully support Ukraine using Western-supplied weapons to hit deep into Russia.At the same time, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Germany will not allow Ukraine to use its weapons for such long-range strikes 'even if other countries decide otherwise.'

US reassures, but sense of urgency questioned by Ukraine as $6 billion military aid hangs in the balance	News that $6 billion worth of outstanding U.S. military aid to Ukraine could expire by the end of September if Congress doesn't take urgent action is unsettling some in Kyiv, where the painful memory of a larger package delay that led to battlefield losses remains fresh.Delivering the $6 billion in additional U.S. aid depends on Congress extending the Pentagon's authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Ukraine. It is part of a larger $61 billion package approved last April after a seven-month delay, despite being critical to helping Kyiv fight off Russia's full-scale invasion.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has asked Congress to include the $6 billion, provided via the Presidential Drawdown Authority program (PDA), in any continuing resolution lawmakers may pass before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 to fund the federal government and — yet again — prevent a shutdown. U.S. officials said they hope to have the authority extended for another year, but the Defense Department is looking into other options if that effort fails.It's unclear why the $6 billion in military aid was not provided earlier, given the urgent needs of Ukraine's armed forces in repelling Russia's full-scale invasion, nor what weaponry it could entail. Multiple government sources in Ukraine and the U.S. declined to discuss the issue in detail.The $6 billion is part of the $61 billion package approved in April, a congressional advisor who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the aid told the Kyiv Independent.The advisor added that the delay in disbursing it due to absorption capacity issues, domestic US stock constraints, and a 'constant flexibility issue with each withdrawal' in a situation where the U.S. adapts to Ukraine's needs.Ukraine's Defense Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the weapons and equipment for the full amount were not yet sent to Ukraine due to 'the lack of the necessary weapons in the Pentagon's warehouses.' The ministry didn't specify which weapons were requested but assured that 'there is no reason to believe that these $6 billion will 'burn out.''An employee handles 155 mm caliber shells after the manufacturing process at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 16, 2024. (Charly Truballeau / AFP via Getty Images)'As far as sources in Congress tell me, the situation is under control, and the money won't be lost - that's the main thing,' David Arakhamia, head of President Volodymyr Zelensky's Servant of the People faction in parliament, told the Kyiv Independent. But the episode appears to be the latest in which Ukraine's top Western ally is drip-feeding weaponry supplies to Ukraine, on purpose or due to a lack of urgency, in an existential war waged by Russia which Zelensky's administration has described as 'genocidal.' Addressing the annual Yalta European Strategy forum held in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14, Biden's national security chief Jake Sullivan spoke of plans to announce a significant assistance package for Ukraine by the end of this month.Yet the sense of many in Kyiv, which is shared with some European allies, is that while the U.S. has stepped up military assistance sharply, it is still not providing sufficient amounts and fast enough to help Ukraine decisively win the war.'It is crucial that all states, and especially those like the United States, implement our agreements really promptly,' Zelensky said in his Sept. 14 evening address to the nation.'Every delay in military packages has its negative consequences at the front. Every truly timely, fast delivery has a positive impact. I briefed the Congressmen on the current situation and the prospects,' he added.Ukrainian drones strike deeper into Russia, aiming to break war machine, sow discontentJust before sunrise on an otherwise sleepy weekend near Moscow, a Russian eyewitness of Ukraine's kamikaze drone attack on the Kashira Power Plant appeared stunned, unleashing an expletive-laden tirade with his wife alongside.

Wow, honey!' he said in a video po...The Kyiv IndependentOleg SukhovZelensky, who is to meet with Biden later this month in the U.S. for talks on future assistance and lifting of restrictions on using Western missiles to strike Russian territory, expressed the same frustration one day earlier about promised but not yet delivered military weaponry from Western allies without directly mentioning the $6 billion U.S. aid.As he addressed the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv, Zelensky said that it's 'really difficult to hear the same answer every time - 'we are working on it.''He also said that the talks on equipping Ukrainian frontline brigades with the West's help had been ongoing 'for months,' with the same vague answer from some 'leaders and states that have made responsible commitments' earlier.'Frankly, we are still far from fully implementing what we have agreed on a long time ago,' Zelensky added.Washington's delay from late 2023 into this spring in passing a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine contributed to the deteriorating situation on the eastern Donbas frontline, where Russia's grinding offensive made advances. In almost seven months of political infighting in the U.S. before the aid was allocated, Ukraine lost some key territories, including the city of Avdiivka, and suffered significant damage to its energy infrastructure around the country due to the lack of air defense systems to counter Russian missile strikes. The legislation was first opposed but later approved by Republican legislators loyal to Donald Trump, who seeks to return as president in a Nov. 5 election against Vice President Kamala Harris. Sense of urgency often lost despite sky-high stakesThe risk of yet another delay in crucial assistance from Ukraine's top Western ally comes as the country's Armed Forces, outgunned and outmanned, continue to battle Russia's full-scale invasion two and a half years into the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II. And as Zelensky continues to press the U.S. and other Western allies for permission to use their long-range missile for strikes into Russian territory.'We have seen this pattern time and again — delays in the allocation of funding, delays in deployment, and delays in deliveries,' Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and former advisor to Zelensky's administration, told the Kyiv Independent.'The sense of urgency is often lost in the Western capitals, but this directly translates into lives lost and an unsafer world. Simply irresponsible,' Mylovanov said.The Biden administration and some European leaders have in the past years expressed fears that arming Ukraine too much — in essence, giving it enough weapons to win the war — could provoke Russia to escalate and potentially use nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin and others in his regime have made such threats. Repeating them recently, they said that the West would be at war with Russia if it allowed its long-range missiles to be used by Ukraine for strikes deep inside Russia.Ukraine, which most recently seized a patch of Russian territory with the Kursk incursion, claims such threats are empty.'Putin's threats do not work. Ukraine's allies should not fall for them,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a Sept. 15 post on X, where he outlined how Russia has during the war repeatedly threatened escalation if Western allies armed Ukraine.'Putin uses threats to weaken support for Ukraine. Instead, allies should boost it. Lift restrictions. Bolster Ukraine's long-range strength, air shield, and economic and energy resilience. Fear and inaction only lead to deaths and crises. To restore peace, we need bravery, not fear,' Sybiha added.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha (C) during their meeting in Kyiv, on Sep. 11, 2024, amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine.

'The administration must utilize all remaining PDA to provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to win this war — just as Congress intended when it provided this authority in the national security supplemental earlier this year,' McCaul added.Democratic Congressman Jim Costa told the Kyiv Independent, 'We are set to work this out,' adding that there might be some friction on the new appropriations package, but the issue is a priority. When asked about the matter by the Kyiv Independent, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor said he was assured by a senior Pentagon official 'not to worry' — that the funds would not expire.'Six billion dollars is serious money... And there are two people in the U.S. government (who know the details of this question) that I talk to all the time... One of them is Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary for defense for arming Ukraine,' Taylor said during an informal press briefing in Kyiv.Cooper 'knows the details of this $6 billion... and she said, 'Bill, don't worry.' And for her to tell me that, I take it,' Taylor said without providing any further details.'Dangerous' delays as rogue states weaponry flows into RussiaBut Mylovanov said the pattern of delays and restrictions on the use of weaponry provided 'is very dangerous and in fact irresponsible.''It was so difficult getting the ($61 billion) supplemental passed. And now there is this bureaucratic (and political?) process that jeopardizes $6 billion,' Mylovanov quipped.He pointed to uninterrupted missile and other weaponry supplies to Russia from rogue states Iran and North Korea.'Iran and North Korea don't appear to be constrained by delays, permissions, and bureaucracy when sending weapons to Russia. Nor are they constraining Russia in how it can use their weapons,' Mylovanov said.The Pentagon is seeking an extension from Congress of PDA authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year, a spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent.'The Department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future,' the Pentagon's statement said.U.S. Military Aid for Ukraine. (Dragon Capital)Publicly, the Pentagon gave similarly nebulous assurances.'I have no doubt that we are going to use everything we can that's available to us to make sure that we are continuing to provide Ukraine what it needs both in the short term and the long term,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a press briefing on Sept. 5.'We're in this fight with Ukraine for the long haul... So you're going to see us make use of those funds in any way possible.'Despite Ukraine's plea to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons to defend its cities, Singh said that it would have 'very little strategic value', since the U.S.-provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) couldn't reach most of the Russian airfields located beyond its 300-kilometers range, according to Pentagon's intelligence.Meanwhile, President Zelensky said in his speech on Sept. 13 that without the ability to strike inside Russia, ATACAMS in Ukraine are 'pointless.' He added that he discussed the matter with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy who visited Kyiv recently.'I hope that after our conversation, there simply cannot be any unanswered questions about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range capability,' Zelensky said.Kyiv Independent Deputy Editor-in-Chief Oleksiy Sorokin contributed reporting to this story.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Trump shooting suspect Ryan Wesley Routh — personal interactions in Ukraine raise questions about support for Kyiv	Almost immediately after a reported second assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, reports emerged of the suspect's apparent support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia.Text messages shared with the Kyiv Independent and conversations with other foreigners living and working in Ukraine paint a picture, however, of a person who misrepresented himself, expressed disdain for Ukraine's war effort, and had delusional ideas of his place in international affairs.The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was taken into custody after the Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire on an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida where Trump was playing golf.Media interviews, social media posts, and videos dug up after his arrest display Routh's passionate support for Ukraine. Routh also spent time Ukraine after the start of the full-scale invasion, and in an interview with the New York Times in June 2023 described plans to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight in the country's International Legion, a military unit composed of foreign volunteers.Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Routh claimed on the social media platform X that he was ready to fight and die in the war against Russia.'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,' he wrote.Russian state media have seized on the reports, describing Routh as a 'pro-Kyiv activist.'Controversial U.S. lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has a history of parroting Kremlin propaganda lines, also said Routh was 'obsessed with the Ukraine war,' and said the U.S. Congress 'must demand answers' about his links to Ukraine.But a WhatsApp conversation in November 2023 with Evelyn Aschenbrenner, who worked in an admin role with the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine at the time, suggests his support for Ukraine wasn't as solid as his social media posts made out.In the conversation, of which Aschenbrenner shared screen shots with the Kyiv Independent, Routh began by saying he had 'thousands of Afghan soldiers if you need soldiers.'The scene outside the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach after a man pointed a gun toward the course while former president Donald Trump was golfing in Florida, United States on Sep. 15, 2024. (Carlos Escalona/Anadolu via Getty Images)Aschenbrenner responded by saying 'that sounds like a massive security risk,' adding: 'The Legion has a recruiting system that you are not part of. You are absolutely not helping anything by doing this.''And PLEASE do not start telling thousands of Afghans to come to Ukraine. That's absurd. If you did nothing at all, I'd be grateful,' Aschenbrenner added.Routh's tone changed dramatically, and he replied by telling Aschenbrenner that he 'lives in Hawaii on a beautiful sandy beach with beautiful girls in bikinis all day.'When Aschenbrenner said that was a 'weird thing to say to a female soldier,' Routh then went on to express contempt for Ukraine's plight amid Russia's invasion.'Really... point is I am happy and not worried about Ukraine. Congress is cutting off all funding now it seems. Good luck,' he said.'Ukraine has chased away all foreign support. Once China attacks Taiwan they can give everything they have to Putin. The gates will be open and I and the world will see the end of Ukraine...'In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Aschenbrenner said Routh 'has been consistently lying that he's connected to the International Legion.''Despite many foreign recruiters and soldiers, as well as Ukrainian officers and commanders, asking him to stop, Routh has repeatedly misrepresented himself,' Aschenbrenner added.The International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, on Sept. 16 rejected any connections to Routh.'We would like to clarify that Ryan Wesley Routh has never been part of, associated with, or linked to the International Legion in any capacity,' the Legion said in a post on social media.'Any claims or suggestions indicating otherwise are entirely inaccurate.'Social media users also warned in June of this year that Routh was 'misrepresenting himself and lying to many people.'Warning about Ryan Routh: he is not, and never has been, associated with the International Legion or the Ukrainian Armed Forces at all.

Toronto Film Festival resumes ‘Russians at War’ screening, ignoring widespread criticism	After announcing on Sept. 12 that screenings of the controversial documentary 'Russians at War' would be paused due to 'significant threats to festival operations and public safety,' the film is set to return to the Toronto International Film Festival's lineup on Sept. 17.The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) runs from Sept. 6 to Sept. 15, so the organizers appear to be holding two special screenings of the film on Sept. 17 outside of the official program.The film was initially pulled in response to significant public backlash both within Canada and internationally, as well as protests held on site at the festival. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, which spearheaded the initial protests, has pledged to continue their efforts following TIFF's ongoing commitment to showing the film.The Toronto police had not been 'aware of any active threats' that would have led the festival to initially limit the screenings of the film, a spokesperson told Canadian media on Sept. 12.Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova's documentary has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash the Russian soldiers involved in Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. During her press tour, Trofimova emphasized that the soldiers featured in her film were 'just ordinary guys' and claimed she did not witness any war crimes during her time with them.Canadian media coverage of the documentary has echoed these sentiments, framing the soldiers as mere pawns in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war. This conclusion has only been met with more backlash given that many of the soldiers portrayed in 'Russians at War' are contract soldiers and therefore chose to participate in the invasion of a sovereign state voluntarily.The organizers of TIFF have claimed in 'no way should this film be considered Russian propaganda.'But critics of the documentary who saw it have noted several issues, perhaps the biggest being Trofimova's omission of the Ukrainian perspective - those defending themselves against an invasion. The documentary also lacks a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, fails to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Putin's regime.'Russians at war' promo material. (TIFF/YouTube)As Dutch film critic Hugo Emmerzael told the Kyiv Independent, 'By blurring the boundaries between the capturing of reality at the front and constructing a narrative at this very same site of conflict, the film becomes an extension of the war apparatus it pretends to examine.' Trofimova also admitted to violating Ukraine's territorial integrity herself by crossing illegally into the country through Russia, telling the Canadian press, 'I'm a citizen of Russia and by Russia standards, this is now considered to be Russian territory, you can just pass through there if you have your passport.' 'The film becomes an extension of the war apparatus it pretends to examine.' Trofimova has also claimed that she filmed on the front line without permission from Russia's Defense Ministry.These ethical issues regarding how she filmed the documentary are compounded by the fact that it was partly financed by public Canadian funds. Since the start of Russia's full-scale war, Canada has been a significant ally of Ukraine, providing the country with over $8 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian aid.Some of the strongest criticism against the film has been made in comments to Russian independent media by Ukrainians and Russians in exile.'You know, it's a trick of documentary filmmaking - when you choose an object to film, and when you go with a camera to one side, and you film the 'exact truth' of the trenches which is 'obscured by the fog of war,' willingly or unwillingly, you choose a side,' Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky, who worked in Russia for decades and fled after the full-scale war, said in an interview on Sept. 10.Rodnyansky noted that while Russian soldiers in the film sense that 'something isn't right' with their actions in Ukraine, they continue to echo the same propaganda narratives broadcasted on Russian state-controlled television.'The most important thing is that I don't believe she worked there (on the front line) without the agreement of the Russian Defense Ministry. To spend (that amount of time) with a battalion is not possible. We understand very well how Russia is organized, and more so, she was wearing the Russian military uniform. It goes against all the rules of journalism.' Critics also noted the subtleties in the film which Westerners who do not speak Russian and are unfamiliar with the history of the region might miss. In her review for Novaya Gazeta Europa, Russian film critic Irina Karpova highlighted the dissonance in Trofimova's voiceover with her emphasis on the 'a' in 'Ukrainian,' which evokes the Russian word 'krai,' meaning 'edge,' and implies linguistically that Ukraine is the borderland of Russia. This is a common mispronunciation among Russian speakers.

Clendenin/Getty Images)Karpova also questioned the achieved outcome of the film. 'Trofimova tries to see the humanity in Russian soldiers, but the footage she captures seems to confirm, rather than refute, the portrayal of Russian soldiers as depicted by YouTube channels like those of (Russian propagandists) Michael Nacke or Vladimir Milov. Even fascists suffer too,' Karpova wrote.Ukrainian-Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, who moved from Russia to Latvia in 2014, told TV Rain that the film could only be shown in the same vein as the work of Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl at this year's Venice Film Festival, with one goal, to show that she wasn't an independent documentarian.'It's a very professionally made film, but in professional language, it's easy to expose (its problems). If the author of the film says supporting only one side of the film stops the war from ending, here it is very clear that the author is on the side of the heroes of her film,' Mansky said. A frequently raised concern regarding Trofimova is that several of her earlier documentaries were produced by RT Documentary, a Russian state-owned channel. Some critics continue to question her potential ties to Russia's war apparatus, with many suggesting that these connections may have influenced her editorial decisions in filmmaking.Trofimova herself brushed off these concerns, saying in an interview with the Globe and Mail that when 'the relatively liberal atmosphere in which we were working started to change' she left RT for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).This period of a 'relatively liberal atmosphere' took place against the backdrop of Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014.Yet there are instances from after the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine that provoke scrutiny.In a public post on her Facebook from Jan. 4, 2023, Trofimova eulogized Kirill Romanovsky, a famous Russian war journalist with close ties to the Wagner mercenary group, which has played a huge role in Russia's war against Ukraine. Romanovsky died under unclear circumstances in Africa, where Wagner also operates.'In your frontline stories, there was no falsehood or that pretentious, overly subdued baritone. You were like that in everything — genuine, compassionate, and real,' Trofimova wrote, adding that he 'managed to do something very right in this life.'Romanovsky's book 'Eight Years with Wagner' includes interviews with members of the mercenary group. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, before his own death in 2023, called Romanovsky his 'comrade' and praised him for 'doing a lot' for Russia. Sean Farnel, who has identified himself as a consulting producer on the documentary 'Russians at War,' has criticized people online who spoke out against the film and Trofimova's background making documentaries for Russian state-owned media.Farnel told one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, that people were 'obsessed' with this part of her filmography, failing to acknowledge why it is highly problematic.Is 'Russians at War' propaganda? We asked 7 people in film who saw itThe documentary 'Russians at War' has sparked controversy since its debut on the festival circuit, with many accusing it of whitewashing Russian soldiers and their crimes in Ukraine. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova has defended the film, calling it 'anti-war.' After facing backlash,...The Kyiv IndependentKate TsurkanNote from the author:Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, sharing an important culture-related story from Ukraine. It's honestly a bit maddening to see that this film about Russian soldiers got made in the first place and that some film critics are defending it. But if you talk to people who actually suffer firsthand from Russia's war, and their allies, you hear entirely different feedback. It's important to note the difference.

Kremlin propagandist attacked in Russia, possibly killed, Ukraine's intelligence reports	Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Sept. 16 that a Kremlin propagandist has been killed in the Russian city of Belgorod. In a post on Telegram, HUR said Aleksandr Korobov died on Sept. 15 after his skull was 'crushed.'According to Russian news outlets, Korobov was heavily injured in an apparent assassination attempt. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim.Korobov - nicknamed 'Crab' - appeared as a war correspondent on Kremlin state media channel, Russia 1, and HUR said he also headed its Belgorod branch.'The propagandist not only prepared false materials about the war, but also personally participated in the commission of serious war crimes against Ukraine,' military intelligence said, adding that Korobov regularly worked in occupied areas of Ukraine.‼️ 'Крабу' проломили череп — на росії ліквідовано воєнного злочинця та пропагандиста кремля  https://t.co/SYlxXhZP3w pic.twitter.com/UTHwQSLcyp— Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 16, 2024 While HUR did not claim responsibility for the attack, the post included both current and former home addresses for Korobov, and noted he 'periodically visited Moscow according to instructions.' It also contained what appears to be covertly recorded, and watermarked footage of a man resembling Korobov walking down the street which then cuts to a close-up of what HUR claims is his dead body.'The military intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reminds that there will be a fair retribution for every war crime,' the post reads.The Kyiv Independent contacted HUR for confirmation of who was behind the attack. It replied with a smiling face with sunglasses emoji.After HUR announced details of the attack, the head of the Belgorod State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Nadezhda Vlasova, said Korobov was injured and in hospital, but had not been killed.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Journalist Georgiy Gongadze, murdered 24 years ago, commemorated in downtown Kyiv on the day of his abduction	A memorial was held in Kyiv on Sept. 16 to mark the 24th anniversary of the abduction of Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze.A number of Ukrainian journalists gathered in downtown Kyiv to open a temporary 'memorial alley,' where, over the course of a week, people can learn more about one of Ukraine's first high-profile journalists murdered for his work.Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Leonid Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv.Tapes later surfaced of Kuchma talking about Gongadze, saying he needs to be dealt with, without explicitly ordering his assassination.Though there was no direct order to kill Gongadze, the scandal prompted mass protests in Kyiv, calling for Kuchma's resignation and making him a prime suspect in the case. He was never officially charged.Three police officers were sentenced to 12 years in jail for their roles in Gongadze's murder, while in January 2016, Oleksiy Pukach, ex-head of the Interior Ministry of Ukraine's surveillance department, was sentenced to life.But despite the sentences, no one has ever been charged with ordering Gongadze's murder.In an op-ed for Ukrainska Pravda on Sept. 16, Gongadze's daughter, Nana, paid tribute to her father as well as 'other fallen journalists' who 'put themselves in harm's way to show the world what is truly happening here, just as my father did when he exposed the corruption of the Kuchma regime.'She highlighted that despite the importance of the work of journalists, 'press freedom in Ukraine is at risk.'Highlighting in particular the work of David Knowles of The Telegraph, who died of a cardiac arrest earlier this month, she added: 'We must honor their sacrifices by closely monitoring and strengthening our press freedom.'	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-georgiy-gongadze-murdered-24-years-ago-commemorated-in-downtown-kyiv-on-the-day-of-his-abduction/	2024-09-16T09:53:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/8_main-v1726497892.webp
Weapons restrictions, fears of escalation are 'pointless,' Estonian president says	Estonian President Alar Karis is very diplomatic.His country of 1.3 million people borders Russia, while the ongoing messy election campaign in Washington, D.C. forces European diplomats to question whether the U.S. will help countries like Estonia in case of a direct confrontation with Moscow.Despite that, Karis doesn't avoid questions, saying that Russia must be defeated and NATO allies must do more to make it happen.'We probably realize now that we have to cross all of these red lines and then start forcing Russia out of Ukraine,' Karis told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in Kyiv.According to Karis, NATO countries must do more for their own defense, Kyiv must be allowed to fire Western missiles without any restrictions, while peace with Russia can be only achieved on Ukrainian terms.Estonian President Alar Karis talks during an interview with the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 14, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)The Kyiv Independent: Mr. President, recently, there's been a lot of news about Russian drones hitting countries not far from Ukraine. Most recently Latvia, and before that, it was Romania, Poland... What's the Estonian position about shooting down Russian drones that enter NATO countries?Alar Karis: We are in a very simple position, we should lift the restrictions on the use of weapons that Ukraine gets from the Western world so we can target these drones where they start (on Russian territory). When this happens, the drones never reach Ukraine, Latvia, or any other country.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think because NATO countries don't down those drones, Russia thinks that NATO is not serious in its intention?Alar Karis: I don't think so. Firstly, we have to know whether it's by accident or if it's deliberate. Latvia and Estonia rely on NATO. We have to start the discussions about how to behave in these kinds of situations, and the discussions have started already.The Kyiv Independent: If, by accident or intentionally, a Russian drone enters Estonia, is the Estonian military allowed to shoot down the drone, or does it need to ask NATO beforehand?Alar Karis: It's a very hypothetical question: What's going to happen and if. As I said, we discussed with our allies, how to behave in this kind of situation.Opinion: What a Trump presidency could look like for Ukraine'Trump will end the Ukraine war.'

Do you think that Estonia is protected enough by being a member of NATO if ex-President Donald Trump enters the White House?Alar Karis: Donald Trump has been president once, and, at that time, we were a NATO member. We don't only rely on NATO allies. We also spend quite a number of our own resources on defense. Next year, it'll be about 3%. What we should do, and we do, is to convince other NATO countries to put more than 2% on defense.The Kyiv Independent: Concerning the recent debate, former President Donald Trump said on multiple occasions that he wants peace, but he never said that he wants Ukraine to win. Do you believe that in the West (especially in the United States), most politicians and both presidential candidates want Ukraine to actually win this war?Alar Karis: We want to defeat Russia, that's for sure. You have to understand that presidential elections in the U.S. mean that there's a debate going on different issues. It's a different situation than when one becomes a president, so let's wait. It's the American people's decision who is going to be the president of the United States. For us, it's very important to keep this transatlantic bond.As far as defense (goes), the U.S. should be number one (leading) in this case.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news deskThe Kyiv Independent: There has been a recent change of doctrine. Now, there is a policy that all three Baltic states want to build a defense line, not allowing Russians to enter the country as a whole. Do you think that Estonia and your neighboring countries are now well-equipped to hold off the Russian army in case it wants to invade?Alar Karis: Of course, we are. But the doctrine is, in a way... What should we do? We are a small country. That means we have to make sure that the enemy does not enter our territory. It's as simple as that.The Kyiv Independent: There has recently been an uptick in Estonian activity. Your former prime minister will be the foreign secretary of the European Union. Do you feel that now, finally, after years of war in Ukraine, Western capitals are hearing the Eastern flank of NATO and the European Union more?Alar Karis: I guess so. Our Western allies, which are much further away from the Russian border, started to understand what this war in Ukraine means not only for Ukraine but also for them. It's not only us who are next to Russia; it's Europe and NATO countries. I think our partners have realized that. And they started to assist and help Ukraine and also to think about their own defense.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that if Washington, London, and Berlin had listened more to Tallinn or Warsaw before the start of the full-scale war, the situation would have been different?Alar Karis: Well, definitely, it would've been different, but we don't know what kind of difference it would have been. These countries are used to this peaceful life - no war, nothing. And we were naive. But we did wake up earlier than our friends far away. What would have happened, I don't know.Putin delays new mobilization, despite Kursk incursion exposing troop shortagesAmid speculation that the Kremlin is considering a new mobilization of conscripts, some potential draftees say they are not enthusiastic about defending Russian territory just over a month after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast.

I swore an oath to the Constituti...The Kyiv IndependentOleg SukhovThe Kyiv Independent: Do you see an increase in Russian intelligence activity or Russian psyops (psychological operations) in Estonia?Alar Karis: Russian intelligence is everywhere. And its propaganda is everywhere, not only in Estonia, but all over the world. You see, even in the United States, they interfere in elections, not only in Europe. So we have to be ready for that. Also, now there is misinformation that is spread by Russia, cyber-attacks, and so forth. So it's not a question of Estonia. It's everywhere, and we have to prepare for this. We have been prepared for cyber-attacks for quite a long time, because they started in 2007. We also start to convince also Western parties that this is a very important issue.The Kyiv Independent: At the beginning of this year, there was a huge case with one professor in Estonia convicted of being a Russian agent in Estonia. How has the Estonian security force scaled up its activity to make sure that there are no Russian agents currently in Estonia?Alar Karis: As you said, we did catch these agents. That means our intelligence works pretty well. And it's not the only case. It has also happened before. So we are ready. Also, agents become smarter. We have to be ready, especially in universities, where a lot of new information and innovations are available. We have to be careful. That's it.From Estonian university professor to convicted Russian spy: the curious case of Viacheslav MorozovEditor's Note: Kyiv Independent News Editor Nate Ostiller briefly attended a summer program at the same Estonian university where the main character of this report was a professor and received a passing grade in a one-week summer school course. A university professor is not the first profession th...The Kyiv IndependentNate OstillerThe Kyiv Independent: You mentioned at the beginning of our interview that Ukraine needs to be allowed to strike Russian targets in Russia. Do you actually know why it's taking so long for many countries to allow this?Alar Karis: One thing is probably that some countries and some leaders are afraid of escalation. There is no escalation anymore. Russia has crossed all red lines already. There is no point in being afraid of escalation. These restrictions are just pointless.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that the war could have been drastically different if all of this had been allowed a year or two ago?Alar Karis: Probably. But the thing is, any country has a different history, political parties, and ideas. That means it does take time. We are not countries with dictators; we are democratic countries. That means you have to also convince your people, not only politicians.Unfortunately, it does take more time. We also hoped that this one step would help - it didn't; the next - didn't either. We probably realize now that we have to cross all of these red lines and then start forcing Russia out of Ukraine.The Kyiv Independent: Russia always says that if its territory is attacked, then it can use nuclear arms. Right now, we have Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast. Do you think that it's still a relevant possibility that Russia will use nuclear weapons, or the European allies and the United States should stop worrying about Russian nuclear saber-rattling?Alar Karis: Russia knows very well that it's not the only nuclear power in Europe and in the world. I don't think we are going to test a nuclear attack on any country.The Kyiv Independent: Estonia has been doing a lot for Ukraine since day one. Can you please explain why, from the first day of the full-scale invasion, Estonia was one of the countries that provided both the most military and humanitarian help (as a percentage of GDP) to Ukraine and why, despite years of war, Estonia continues to do it?Alar Karis: We have our own history, and we know what occupation meant when the Soviet Union occupied our country. We and our parents have this kind of memory - that's one reason. As a small independent country, we can't afford for these powerful countries to cross the border of independent countries. We'll continue to support Ukraine, of course.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that the world is now tired of this war? We hear some voices saying that maybe Ukraine needs a plan B, maybe Ukraine won't be able to de-occupy all of its territory, and it needs to hold peace talks with Russia. Do you feel that as long as this war continues, more voices in the West will try to persuade Ukraine to find a solution to the war that doesn't involve de-occupying all of its territory?Alar Karis: At this very moment, we can't afford these big peace talks because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has already said what he wants. He wants NATO back to the 1997 borders, Donbas, other Ukrainian regions, and so forth.That means, as I said, we should push Russia back to its territory and convince it that this war was useless. Then we can sit behind the table and start talking. We have a peace plan - a peace formula provided by Zelensky. It's the only peace plan at this very moment.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think NATO countries and NATO as a whole are doing enough to help Ukraine win?Alar Karis: It's never enough. We could do more. We could do much more. Also, while here in Kyiv, I mentioned that we should do more — not only Estonia and other states, but we all. We are on the side of democracy, and we should do much more.Estonian PM: 'Our taxpayers shouldn't pay for damages caused by Russia'Editor's Note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Opinion: Putin’s red carpet in Mongolia was a betrayal of justice and accountability	Mongolia's president welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin in the capital of Ulaanbaatar on Sept. 3 for an official ceremony commemorating a Soviet-Mongolian military victory during World War II. While Putin has attended such ceremonies regularly over the years, the key difference this time was that he traveled to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member country as a fugitive of the ICC. It was the first time Putin visited an ICC member since the court made his arrest warrant public in March 2023.As an ICC member, Mongolia was obligated to arrest him, but it did not.There's no question about what Mongolia was required to do. Putin should never have been invited in the first place, and as soon as he set foot on Mongolian soil, he should have been arrested - not met with a red carpet. Opinion: State predation threatens to derail Ukraine's war effortRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to a resurgence in state predation against businesses, now approaching pre-EuroMaidan levels. This issue cannot be postponed until after the war. Politicized, predatory actions by law enforcement agencies against both domestic and fore...The Kyiv IndependentAlan RileyThe Mongolian government failed the victims of grave international crimes in Ukraine. It also failed its own commitment as an ICC member to be part of the global community supporting victims' access to justice through the court and its broader system of accountability. The principle that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law is a cornerstone of that system. The Mongolian government failed the victims of grave international crimes in Ukraine. The ICC cannot, on its own, make this ideal a reality. The court relies on member countries to cooperate and enforce its arrest warrants. Last year, Putin was expected to attend a BRICS summit in South Africa. But along with pressure from civil society groups, a legal case helped ensure that South Africa's obligation to execute the ICC arrest warrant would be upheld domestically. 'By mutual agreement,' the South African president announced, Putin's visit was ultimately canceled.To be sure, arresting a suspect is one of the most difficult challenges in delivering international justice. It is a long road, but with persistence, principled support for justice, and, crucially, political will, progress is possible. South Africa's example shows that the world of ICC fugitives, no matter how powerful, can shrink significantly.Russian President Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech at the meeting in Zaryadye Hall, in Moscow, Russia Sep. 7, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)It took 12 years to arrest Radovan Karadžić, but he was ultimately convicted in 2016 for his crimes in Bosnia by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The European Union conditioned closer ties with Serbia, where Karadžić was hiding, on its full cooperation with the ICTY, including the arrest and surrender of fugitives. This example should remind countries that international justice only works when they support its enforcement.Looking ahead, every step will matter to ensure that future arrests materialize. The ICC treaty provides for enforcement proceedings against non-cooperating states. It remains to be seen whether these will be applied to Mongolia. In the meantime, there are already consequences. The Mongolian government's inaction has been widely condemned, with states and regional organizations like the EU speaking out in support of the court.All other ICC members should reinforce these efforts and strongly condemn Mongolia for failing to meet its legal obligations. This is key to upholding the authority of the court's warrants and ensuring ICC suspects are arrested in the long term.Opinion: How Kamala Harris' foreign policy could depart from Biden's legacyFollowing President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris' ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, a crucial question emerges: How would Harris' foreign policy depart from Biden's?

Victims, their families, and survivors need to know they can rely on the ICC to pursue justice.At the same time, Ukraine is taking important steps to advance the promise of justice. After years of campaigning by national and international human rights groups, in late August, Ukraine's parliament passed a law to ratify the ICC treaty. The country has never been closer to becoming a full member of the court, whose investigation into grave crimes committed in Ukraine has already yielded six significant arrest warrants as the fighting continues.However, Ukraine's newly enacted law includes limitations on the ICC's mandate that, if acted on, could shield war criminals from justice. Ukraine should support the court and its work without reservations. Only a strong and full commitment to the ICC will show the principled approach to justice that Ukraine and the world need.Putin's trip to Mongolia is an important reminder that there is still much to do to end impunity for the most serious crimes. Today, tomorrow, every day, it takes creative, principled, and sometimes courageous action by ICC members and other supportive states to uphold justice, the court's work, and its decisions.Editor's Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.

UK's Starmer seeking European support for Ukraine long-range missile strike proposal, Bloomberg reports	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held talks in Italy with his Italian counterpart on Sept. 16, in an effort to gain support for his proposal to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Starmer will also hold similar talks in France and Germany in the coming days.Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made.According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia but wants the backing of the U.S. and other countries.Starmer suggested last week the plan would be further discussed 'with a wider group of individuals' at the UN general assembly in New York later this month.The issue was on the agenda in Italy, where Starmer met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. In a joint press conference, both leaders were asked about long-range missile strikes. Meloni said she supports the decision of allies to give Ukraine the go-ahead, adding that Italy is committed to ensuring Ukraine can enter peace negotiations with Russia in the 'very best conditions.'Starmer gave a broad answer, reiterating Ukraine's right to self-defense and reaffirming support in its 'fight for sovereignty.'The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Opinion: Life, death, and social solidarity in dark times	The following lecture was delivered in March 2023 at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy as part of a benefit conference to raise funds to support public outreach at Kyiv Mohyla Academy.The topic of my speech is: What is it like thinking in dark times? What does it mean? It is an echo of the podcast series I launched within our podcast, 'Explaining Ukraine,' one of the most widely listened-to podcasts in English about Ukraine. The idea was to not stop thinking, even during dark times.When I shared this idea with Marci Shore, a professor at Yale University, she asked: 'Does it refer to Hannah Arendt's book 'Men in Dark Times?'' I said: 'Yeah, I hadn't thought about this.' But there is indeed a reference: a parallel between our time and Arendt's reflections.For me, the idea of light is very interesting and important, and the idea of darkness as well. I do think that different epochs and times have certain relations to light and darkness. Some eras, like the Renaissance, Enlightenment, or the second half of the 20th century, were infused with the idea of light, transparency, and open space - an open perspective that brings everything to light. We have this notion that light is the norm, and darkness is a deviation.But there are other epochs, like the Baroque period in the 17th century or Romanticism in the 19th century, in which reflection starts from the opposite idea. It starts from the idea that darkness is our norm and light is an exception. Light rarely appears and can disappear quickly, so we should cherish it.One metaphor for this is found in Baroque painting: the chiaroscuro of Caravaggio, Rembrandt, van Honthorst, and Georges de La Tour. There is something in the emotion of this chiaroscuro: light emerging from and contrasting sharply with darkness. It is not just a painting technique; it carries an emotion that light is a rarity, a deficit. We actually start with the darkness, and inside the darkness, we start thinking.Opinion: State predation threatens to derail Ukraine's war effortRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to a resurgence in state predation against businesses, now approaching pre-EuroMaidan levels. This issue cannot be postponed until after the war. Politicized, predatory actions by law enforcement agencies against both domestic and fore...The Kyiv IndependentAlan RileyThis kind of thinking arises during difficult times. We understand how challenging the 16th and 17th centuries were for Europe, the early 19th century, or even the early 20th century in Europe, where we could also doubt that light is the norm.My first book in Ukrainian, for example, was dedicated to Walter Benjamin. I knew there was something in Benjamin that went beyond the interpretation of him that was popular at the time. That interpretation was very postmodernist: 'Let's look at Walter Benjamin as a sort of first deconstructionist, Derrida before Derrida.' I thought this was wrong because Benjamin was, for me, a Baroque thinker, a thinker of chiaroscuro, where truth is a deficit, a rarity, a kind of enlightenment through darkness.This is important, and we should not overlook it because many influential thinkers start thinking in dark times. We should probably think of Descartes as a Baroque philosopher who says: 'Look, we are in darkness, deceived by an evil genius, a bad spirit who plays with us.' We don't know the right path, so we must invent a method to get out of this place. Suddenly, we realize that Descartes' rationalist philosophy is actually more existential than we used to think.I think something is happening in Ukraine right now that we should pay attention to: this experience of facing a war, the fragility of life, and death, which is painful but might be the origin of thinking, literature, poetry, and art. The poetry now produced by Ukrainian poets is incredible. Writers like Serhii Zhadan, Halyna Kruk, Kateryna Kalytko, Kateryna Babkina, Julia Musakovska, Pavlo Korobchuk, and Svitlana Povalyaeva give us very strong poetry. This is more than poetry; it's strong literature. It's more than just words. It's existential. 'I think something is happening in Ukraine right now that we should pay attention to: this experience of facing a war, the fragility of life, and death, which is painful but might be the origin of thinking, literature, poetry, and art.' I hope the current epoch will give us an impetus for new thinking, reflection, and philosophy. I keep thinking about the basic concepts of philosophy. I hope this period will produce something new in Ukrainian philosophy, and maybe it already is.I also believe this time of war shows how important ideas are. I agree with Tim Snyder, who repeatedly says one cause of this war is bad ideas. I think we underestimate how bad ideas can kill people and how morally bad ideas can kill people. They are not innocent; they are not just words. Ukrainian freak-cabaret Dakh Daughters perform at The International Centre of Culture and Arts (October Palace) in Kyiv, Ukraine on April 26, 2024. (Yuri Gryaznov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)For example, the idea that Russia is an empire that needs to expand, that Ukraine is a non-existent state, that the history of Ukraine is the history of Russia - these are bad ideas made by bad historians. But when bad history turns into ideology, it turns into a weapon. Once you say Ukraine does not exist or does not have a right to exist, the next step is to eliminate the idea of Ukraine and all the people who hold it. This is a direct step to genocide, which is happening right now. I think ideas play a big role in our lives and history. Ideas persist and go beyond the material reality of our daily existence, and we should be very attentive to ideas.There has been a devaluation of ideas in recent decades, both in Eastern Europe and the Western world. This may have something to do with postmodernism, or at least with the relativization of ideas, the thought that ideas are interchangeable. I think this is profoundly wrong, and we should pay attention to the power of ideas.For this lecture, I have been thinking about how the current situation leads us to rethink many things. I will try to share some thoughts about words and concepts that I have been rethinking since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.First, we need to rethink our idea of life. Life has become banal, particularly during peaceful times. But during war, when you face death and when death is no longer an abstract word, you understand how fragile life, society, our physical bodies, and culture are, how everything can be undone quickly, and how those who believe in the inevitable progress of history are wrong. Opinion: How Russian propaganda reached Venice's red carpetA film about Russian soldiers taking part in the war against Ukraine was recently presented at the Venice Film Festival. The film portrays ordinary people who care about their families, joke, and have doubts, fears, and dreams. Some fight to avenge a fallen comrade, some just to make money, whileThe Kyiv IndependentOleksandra MatviichukSeeing this is key. Of course, war is an absolute evil. But when you have no choice but to face war, death, and destruction, you realize how you can cherish life in a new way, how you can value living beings in a new way.One example is the attention Ukrainians now pay to the life of each person, and not just living people. There is an enormous amount of ritual around our dead soldiers. This change dates to as early as EuroMaidan. When a village buries its dead, every resident lines the streets for the procession. When famous people or heroes are killed, social networks talk about them. Recently, a prominent young Ukrainian soldier, known as DaVinci, died, and all of Ukraine talked about it. Life is fragile, but it's cherished.I recently returned from Nikopol, a town six kilometers from Russian troops, near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, which is occupied by the Russians. I met a woman named Olena, who takes care of a shelter for 250 pets despite regular shelling by the Russian army and the threat of a major nuclear disaster. We see over and over again how people care in these difficult times, and I think that's important.Another reflection on life is that life as a biological fact is not full if it is not filled with meaning, with values like freedom. As the famous Ukrainian paramedic Tyra, who spent a lot of time in Russian captivity, recently said: 'Life without freedom doesn't matter.' This brings us back to the old idea of dignity. If we go back to the idea of dignity in Roman times, we understand that dignity is the continuation of life beyond life. It's something non-material, something that goes beyond biology but is cherished no less than - or even more than - biological life.One story Ukraine is discussing is that of a Ukrainian soldier, a prisoner of war, who was told by Russian soldiers to dig his own grave and remove the Ukrainian symbols from his uniform. He refused, said, 'Glory to Ukraine,' and was shot on the spot. This dignity - the refusal to surrender identity even in the face of death - is something incredible. This is when the word dignity becomes very practical and material.A woman holds a candle during a minute of silence in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 6, 2022, during a memorial 40 days after the Olenivka attack. (Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images)The second idea we need to rethink is death. Death is not a metaphor; it is not just a word. It was almost sick to see how the word death became popular in the 20th century. We talked about the death of culture, the death of modernity, the death of idealism, the death of metaphysics, and in all this, we played with the word death. It became less scary, something far away with which we could play.But for Ukrainians, death is not an abstract word: it's a physical death, a real death, a void when your loved ones die, when your husbands die, when your children die, when your friends die.The third concept we need to consider is evil - not just evil in the abstract or philosophical sense, such as Arendt's notion of the banality of evil, which has been validated by the current war, but something beyond that. The evil we are confronting in Ukraine is repetitive. It's an evil that has gone unpunished, unjudged, and uncondemned. This impunity forms a vicious cycle, granting evil the power to assert itself as a new norm. In such cases, those committing these atrocities begin to see themselves not as killers, but as judges - an insidious reversal of justice. This mentality is rooted in Russian history and the Soviet legacy, where figures like Putin inherit a tradition of unchecked violence by the KGB, committing atrocities without trial or accountability.The fourth idea that we need to take seriously is the notion that society is very important. We probably entered a period in developed democracies in which we have the illusion that we can all do it by ourselves. We are living increasingly in an atomistic society, where we believe that an individual can do everything. We don't need other people. Even if you're playing music, you don't need other players or other instruments, you can do everything on your computer. You can play video games by yourself; you can do everything by yourself. This is an illusion.Society may be less visible, but we all depend on our societies, we all depend on other people. We are wearing clothes, which other people made. We are reading books, which other people have written. We are using goods, which other people have produced. And if you remove that, if you remove this society, we will be helpless, we will not even be Robinson Crusoe, because we will not have those habits of survival. I think we tend to forget about this in this age of atomization. War actually brings you back to this notion that we can cherish our individual freedoms, we can cherish our individualities, but we are all connected to a wider network. And we will not survive without this network. And this network will not survive without us.Explainer: Ukraine's $15 billion IMF loan programMaxwell Kushnir is a research analyst at the IMF.

We are all so intertwined, and I think this idea gives you simultaneously a sense of responsibility and modesty. You understand that your effort, however important it might be, is just a drop in the ocean. And if there are no other drops, there is no ocean.The final point I want to make in this lecture is kind of connected with the first idea I mentioned. This war is of course a question of humanity. But at the same time, it's a question of going beyond humanity. It's also a war which leads us to think about life in wider terms. Humans are not the only ones suffering from this war. Animals are suffering, ecosystems are suffering. In many aspects, what Russia is doing is not only a genocide but also an ecocide. Look at how they set fire to Ukrainian fields, how they destroy our ecosystems in the South, which are so important for global food. We travel through Ukraine and we see these fields in which harvests were not collected because of the Russian invasion. We understand how long this supply chain is. And from the fact that the harvest was not collected last year, we realize that there are people all around the world who may face hunger or famine.This means we need to see the planet as a single organism in which everything depends on everything else, and in which, when we think about ethics of life, we should think beyond humans. That doesn't mean we should devalue humans, but we should understand that maybe one of the key ethical revolutions of the 21st century will be a revolution in which we extend the idea of dignity from humans to other living beings, to nature as such.I think Ukrainians have an implicit understanding of this idea, due to the impact of colonization and modernization. Death and famine were the result of Soviet colonization and industrial policy in the 1930s, for example. And it's clear that we are suffering from Russia's colonial aspirations and destructive technology today. So, I do think that the Ukrainian experience, including our experience of this war, can help us rethink our relation to nature as well.Editor's Note: This essay was originally published as part of a special issue of 'Studia Philosophica Estonica' entitled 'Reflections on the Russia-Ukraine War.'

Putin signs decree increasing number of military personnel, staff to 2.38 million	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Sept. 16 increasing the number of the Russian Armed Forces from roughly 2.2 million to 2,389,130 people, including 1.5 million military personnel.The decree will take effect on Dec. 1, 2024, and will increase the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000. The last time the staffing level was increased was in December 2023. It amounted to 2,209,130 people, including 1,320,000 military personnel. In August 2022, six months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started, the number of personnel in the Russian Armed Forces increased to 1,150,628. The 2017 decree was in force at that time, according to which the staff should have been 1,013,628, a figure relevant at the time of the outbreak of full-scale war.Russia conscripted around 300,000 reservists during a limited mobilization in September 2022 but has sought to avoid a wide-sweeping draft, often targeting recruits from economically weaker regions or migrants.Ukraine believes that Russia continues to covertly recruit around 30,000 soldiers monthly, allowing the Russian military to balance out its losses.While Moscow does not publish its casualty figures, Kyiv believes that Russian losses have exceeded over 630,000 soldiers killed, wounded, or captured as of September.Putin delays new mobilization, despite Kursk incursion exposing troop shortagesAmid speculation that the Kremlin is considering a new mobilization of conscripts, some potential draftees say they are not enthusiastic about defending Russian territory just over a month after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine passed mobilization law a year too late, Polish FM Sikorski says	Ukraine adopted a law on mobilization at least one year too late, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in an interview with European Pravda published on Sept. 15.Ukraine adopted the law in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine opened a new front in Russia's Kursk Oblast.Sikorski said that the law should have been passed when there were 'many volunteers' to serve in the army and 'people felt personally threatened.' The minister also said he was surprised by the high number of military-aged Ukrainian men in Poland.'I go to a hairdresser in Warsaw, and a young Ukrainian barber cuts my hair. And I asked him: 'What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be defending your country?'' Sikorski said.The minister stressed that Poland does not pay social assistance to refugees who are able to work, adding that Western European governments are 'more generous.''The question is whether there should be financial incentives there (in the EU) rather than here (in Ukraine),' Sikorski said.The Ukrainian government has told its Polish counterparts that it wants Ukrainian citizens to return home to pay taxes and work at factories, the minister noted. 'But also, you need people to rotate those brave soldiers fighting at the front line,' he added.Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25.After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, 4,690,496 military-aged men have done so, the country's Defense Ministry said.Ukraine's mobilization effort gets boost as millions update draft dataBy early 2024, 40-year-old Pavlo Kovtoniuk had begun to understand that Russia's two-year-long full-scale war against his country would require him to serve in the army sooner or later.

Russia continues to store ammunition, deploy troops at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Kyiv says	Russian forces continue to use the territory of the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives, Ukraine's National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15.In a statement made less than two weeks after a visit by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Rafael Grossi to the plant, the center criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the presence of the military contingent and arms.The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

He inspected various sections of the plant, including a pumping station and a nuclear fuel storage facility.Following the visit, Grossi said that a cooling tower at the facility would require demolition after a fire on Aug. 12 rendered the structure unusable. The fire did not pose a risk to nuclear safety at the plant.According to the center, Russian leadership controlling the facility planned the IAEA's route. This is not the first time the agency has been denied access to the western part of the two turbine halls.'However, the (IAEA's) representatives only recorded this fact and did not make any decision regarding the representatives of Rosatom, which manages the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,' the statement read.The center also criticized the agency for supposedly ignoring the presence of the military contingent at the facility and the storage of ammunition and substances that endanger nuclear safety.Prior to his visit to the plant, Grossi visited the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant after Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the plant amid the ongoing incursion in the area.

Russia has launched over 640 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in September, Zelensky says	Russian forces attacked Ukraine with more than 640 Shahed-type drones during the first half of September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 16.Zelensky's statement comes after a recent Russian attack against nine oblasts and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with 56 Shahed-type drones. Fifty-three of them were reported as shot down, while the remaining three 'disappeared' from radar on Ukrainian territory. 'We are constantly working to make the Ukrainian air shield more effective. We are strengthening our Air Force, mobile fire groups, and all air defense units,' Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel.Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the all-out war.

Zelensky denounces apparent assassination attempt on Trump	Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 16 denounced a recent apparent assassination attempt on U.S. presidential candidate and ex-President Donald Trump.'I am glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe and unharmed. My best wishes to him and his family,' Zelensky said on X.'It's good that the suspect in the assassination attempt was apprehended quickly. This is our principle: the rule of law is paramount and political violence has no place anywhere in the world.'The Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate.The suspect detained in connection to the attack was identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. Based on his social media activity, Routh has cast himself as a supporter of Ukraine and spoke to the New York Times in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight for Kyiv.It is unclear whether Routh managed to recruit any volunteers for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify his claims.The International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, a military unit composed of foreign volunteers, rejected any connections to Routh.'We would like to clarify that Ryan Wesley Routh has never been part of, associated with, or linked to the International Legion in any capacity,' the Legion said in a comment for Euronews.'Any claims or suggestions indicating otherwise are entirely inaccurate.'Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump.There are fears that Routh's apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Poland will finance Czech artillery initiative for Ukraine, minister pledges amid delays	Warsaw will contribute to the Czech-led initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukrainian forces in the future, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in an interview with European Pravda published on Sept. 15.Sikorski's statement comes after news that Poland has not yet donated funds to the Czech initiative despite its promises. The minister confirmed that Warsaw has not yet participated in the project due to 'temporary formal obstacles.'Warsaw plans to allocate 50 million euros ($55.6 million) to the Czech initiative in 2024 and another 50 million euros in 2025, according to Sikorski.'But there are some technical, administrative, and legal issues related to the (Polish) State Agency for Strategic Reserves,' Sikorski said.'The (Polish) Foreign Ministry has done its part. I hope that colleagues from other ministries will also do theirs. It will definitely be done,' he added.Czechia unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners earlier this year amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance.Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told the Kyiv Independent in July that the initiative had secured funds for 500,000 rounds and hopes to finance 300,000 more by the end of 2024.

The Ukrainian positions in the region are now threatened by a Russian counterattack launched last week. 'Since the first day of the Kursk operation, Ukraine's Defense Forces demonstrated full adherence to international humanitarian law as a professional army with high standards and values of freedom and human life,' Sybiha said on X.'Ukraine is ready to facilitate their work and prove its adherence to international humanitarian law.'Kyiv previously said it would follow international humanitarian law during its conduct on Russian territory. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Aug. 14 that her office opened a '24-hour hotline for residents of Kursk Oblast who need humanitarian aid or want to evacuate to Ukraine.'The ICRC has come under criticism from Kyiv over its supposedly insufficient response to the humanitarian crisis sparked by Russia's war.

Latvia to supply Ukraine with British-made CVR(T) armored vehicles	Latvia will provide Ukraine with CVR(T) armored vehicles previously purchased from the U.K., the Delfi outlet reported on Sept. 15, citing the Latvian Defense Ministry.The vehicles' number and other details were not disclosed due to security concerns, Delfi wrote.The news comes shortly after Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina announced a new military aid package for Ukraine, including armored personnel carriers.The CVR(T) (Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)) is a British-designed armored vehicle family that entered service in the U.K. military in the 1970s. It exists in various variants and is capable of carrying out a wide range of tasks.Latvia operates at least 123 of these vehicles, namely Scimitar reconnaissance vehicles, Sultan command and control vehicles, Spartan armored personnel carriers, Samson armored recovery vehicles, and Samaritan ambulance vehicles.In 2019, the Latvian government signed a contract for over 80 more vehicles, though the number was later reduced to over 70.Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds recently said that the procurement of new vehicles to replace the CVR(T) is in its final stages.Latvia, one of Ukraine's biggest supporters, has committed to providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year and will provide thousands of drones.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

I can exchange anyone, but not the Chechens who voluntarily surrendered,' Alaudinov said in a video address on his Telegram channel.Chechen units fighting on Russia's side were deployed in Kursk Oblast during Ukraine's surprise incursion launched in early August. A number of Chechen fighters ended up in Ukrainian captivity, while the Akhmat unit was accused by Russian milbloggers of offering little resistance when the incursion began.Alaudinov said it is necessary to secure the release of wounded Chechen captives, but those who surrendered without a fight should attempt suicide.'Chechens have always considered surrendering to captivity to be the greatest disgrace.

Fugitive Ukrainian ex-MP Derkach appointed to Russian Senate	Russia's Astrakhan Oblast Governor Igor Babushkin appointed Andrii Derkach, a fugitive ex-member of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada, as a senator, according to a Sept. 12 decree.Members of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament—unofficially called the Russian Senate — are not directly elected in a popular vote but are nominated by regional administrations. A region can send two representatives to the Senate: one proposed by the governor and approved by the regional legislature and another elected by the legislature itself.Derkach, who had been a Ukrainian lawmaker for nearly 20 years, had not attended meetings of the Ukrainian parliament since the start of the full-scale invasion. In 2023, his parliamentary powers were prematurely terminated.The U.S. government has called Derkach 'a Russian agent' and sanctioned him in 2022, accusing him of attempted election interference. Kyiv also imposed sanctions against the ex-lawmaker in 2021 and placed him on its wanted list.According to TASS, Derkach now lives in Astrakhan and has Russian citizenship. President Volodymyr Zelensky revoked Derkach's Ukrainian citizenship in January 2023.In 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) exposed a Russian agent network in Ukraine, which included Derkach.Authorities said that the former lawmaker received funds from Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) to create private security structures that Russia planned to use to capture Ukraine. Russia allocated $3-4 million every few months for the purpose, according to law enforcement.In 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) completed an investigation into suspected treason and illicit enrichment on Derkach's part.Derkach, a former member of the now-banned pro-Russian Party of Regions, received at least $567,000 from Russian law enforcement and intelligence agencies for subversive activities against Ukraine, NABU said.The politician was supposed to discredit the country at the international level, deteriorate diplomatic relations with the U.S., and hinder Ukraine's integration into the European Union and NATO, according to the investigation.Ukraine launches international search for controversial lawmaker Artem DmytrukThe State Bureau of Investigation previously confirmed on Aug. 26 that Dmytruk illegally crossed the border in Odesa Oblast and entered Moldova.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/derkach-appointed-russian-senator/	2024-09-15T23:03:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/4128d52-------_690x387.png

Air defense repels mass drone attack against Kyiv	Ukrainian air defense units repelled a 'massive' Russian drone attack targeting Kyiv in the early hours of Sept. 16, according to Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. The drone strike marked the eighth aerial attack against Kyiv this month, Popko said. The Air Force announced an aerial alert over Kyiv at around 2 a.m. local time on Sept. 16. The alert lasted for three and a half hours, according to Popko. Russia launched multiple groups of attack drones at Kyiv from different directions throughout the night.Air defense forces intercepted 'almost two dozen' unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the city's airspace. There were no casualties or damage in Kyiv as a result of the attack, according to preliminary reports. An overnight drone strike against Kyiv on Sept. 7 damaged multiple residential buildings.

Suspect detained in Trump assassination attempt claimed to support Ukraine	Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt of former U.S. President Donald Trump on Sept. 15, claimed to support Ukraine and used his social media platform to attempt to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight Russia's full-scale invasion. The Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate. Routh, 58, was taken into custody following the incident, according to law enforcement officers. He was detained by local law enforcement on the highway and was reportedly unarmed at the time of his arrest. Routh spoke to the New York Times (NYT) in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight in Ukraine. A former roofing contractor with no military experience, Routh used his Facebook account to appeal to conscripts in Afghanistan. 'Afghan Soldiers- Ukraine is somewhat interested in 3000 soldiers, so I need every soldier that has a passport to send me a copy of their passport to send to Ukraine,' Routh said in one such Facebook post, according to CNN. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Routh claimed on the social media platform X that he was ready to fight and die in the war against Russia. 'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,' he said. It is unclear what actual support for Ukraine Routh provided apart from posts on social media. Routh told the NYT that he had traveled to Ukraine in 2022 and spent several months there. He also claimed to have met with the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe to lobby for support for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication. Routh's social media history reflects a grandiose sense of his own importance in political affairs. In a post on X in 2020, he invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to his home in Hawaii, offering his services as 'ambassador and liaison.' Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump.Routh's apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Russian aircraft detected near Alaska for third time in 1 week	Two Russian IL-38 military aircraft were detected and tracked while operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Sept. 14, marking the third such incident in one week, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported on Sept. 15. The Russian planes remained in international airspace and did not violate U.S. or Canadian airspace, NORAD reported. The flights are 'not seen as a threat.' Earlier in the week, NORAD on Sept. 11 said it detected two Russian military aircraft operating in the ADIZ. Two days later, the agency on Sept. 13 detected a pair of Russian Tu-142 military aircraft in the area. NORAD defines the ADIZ as a 'stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security.'Earlier this summer, the U.S. and Canada, which make up NORAD, scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian and Chinese military planes in the ADIZ on July 25.

Iranian president to attend BRICS summit in Russia	Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will attend the upcoming BRICS summit hosted in Kazan, Russia in October, Iranian state media reported on Sept. 15, citing Iran's ambassador in Russia Kazem Jalali.The announcement comes amid increased cooperation between Russia and Iran, and heightened tensions between Iran and Western nations following Tehran's transfer of ballistic missiles to the Russian military. Jalali confirmed on Sept. 15 that Pezeshkian will attend the BRICS summit and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tehran and Moscow are expected to sign a bilateral cooperation agreement at the summit.Pezeshkian reportedly told Putin in July that Iran was prepared to enter 'a comprehensive strategic partnership' with Russia during the BRICS forum. Iran remains one of Russia's closest allies and a key weapons provider. The two nations have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The U.S., U.K., France, and Germany announced additional sanctions against Iran after Washington confirmed reports that Tehran had shipped Fath-360 ballistic missiles to Moscow. The new sanctions targeted a number of individuals and entities, including national airline Iran Air. The Iranian government has denied sending the weapons and criticized the sanctions. The BRICS summit will be held in Kazan, Russia from Oct. 22-24. Russia now has Iran's Fath-360 ballistic missile — here's what it means for UkraineAfter months of contradictory reports, the U.S. on Sept. 10 confirmed that Iran had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia in what could prove a dramatic development for Ukraine.

Trump safe after shots fired at golf course	Former U.S. President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been reported safe following gunshots at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Sept. 15, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced. A man has been taken into custody and the FBI is investigating the incident as a possible assassination attempt against former President Trump. 'President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time,' Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement on Sept. 15. An armed individual reportedly opened fire at the course while Trump was golfing with with campaign donor Steve Witkoff. Authorities have not released the name of the detained suspect, and the suspect has not made any statements. U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the shooting and expressed relief for Trump's safety. 'I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America,' Harris wrote on X. The golf course shooting comes two months after an assassination attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump sustained injuries to his ear, and an audience member was killed. The July assassination attempt sparked a wave of Russian disinformation campaigns falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump. The U.S. presidential election is less than two months away. American voters on Nov. 5 will choose between Trump and Harris after an election cycle marked by dramatic upheavals. Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive''My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,' Zelensky said during a clip of the CNN interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15.The Kyiv IndependentDmytro Basmat	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-safe-after-shots-fired-at-golf-course/	2024-09-15T14:47:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170949109.jpg

Warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Guard of Ukraine, border guards, and police officers.''The vast majority of those released are people who had been held (in captivity) since the first days of the war,' said Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets in a statement.‌‌‌‌ Lubinets stressed that people who returned need serious rehabilitation, as their health has deteriorated severely during captivity.‌‌‌‌Previously, the United Nations commission published several reports describing the torture of Ukrainian POWs as 'widespread and systematic,' and the conditions of their detention as 'shocking.' Some Ukrainian POWs died in captivity from causes such as 'blunt force trauma'.This is the 57th prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and the second exchange carried out in the last two days.Earlier on Sept. 13, 49 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were released from Russian captivity. They included personnel of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Police, and border guards.A total of 3,672 Ukrainians have been brought back from Russian captivity.Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was one of the subjects at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.At least 1 killed, 42 injured in Russian strike on high-rise in KharkivOne woman, 94, was killed, and 42 people were injured in a Russian air strike that hit a 12-story apartment building in Kharkiv and caused a fire, authorities reported on Sept. 15.Among the injured were three children, the youngest being one year old.President Volodymyr Zelensky shared photos of the damage on his Telegram channel, saying rescue operations were ongoing and that the fire had spread through the 9th through 12th floors.Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said three children were among the initial estimated 25 injured. He later raised the toll to 35, and then to 42, and said that at least three were in serious condition. Twelve people were hospitalized, and more people are under the rubble, Syniehubov said.Police received a report of at least one missing person that could be under the rubble, said Ihor Klymenko, interior affairs minister.According to him, one of the building's residents refused to evacuate without his dog, so the State Emergency Service workers rescued both the man and his pet from the smoke-filled apartment on the 12th floor.The police set up an operational headquarters at the scene, with residents filing more than 30 reports of property damage, he said.At least 1,500 windows and dozens of cars were damaged, according to Syniehubov.Shortly before the reported strike, the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, warned that Russia had launched several KABs, or guided bombs.Russia launches counteroffensive in Kursk - can it push Ukraine off its own turf?More than a month after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion into Russian territory, Russian forces have begun counterattacking in Kursk Oblast, aiming to eventually drive Ukrainian troops out of the partially occupied border region.

He also emphasized that the aid shipments are slow to follow after partners pledge them.'During this 8-month pause before the positive decision of the U.S. Congress (to provide the $61-billion aid package last April) — what we did, everybody has to understand: We used everything we could,' Zelensky said.'We moved (to use) what we had in storages, and whatever the reserve brigades had - (those brigades that) we need now (to fight),' he added.Zelensky also defended the Ukrainian military command's decision to launch the Kursk incursion into Russia in August to divert Russian troops there, rather than keep Ukrainian forces in the eastern Pokrovsk direction, where Russian army was making relatively rapid territorial gains over the past weeks.Zelensky said that it didn't matter how many brigades were defending the east, if 'half of them is not equipped.' Specifically, he said they were lacking armored vehicles and artillery shells, as Russian forces fired 12 times more rounds than Ukrainian troops.Undistracted by Kursk offensive, Russia cuts deeper toward Pokrovsk in Donetsk OblastAs the world watched Ukraine's stunning cross-border offensive into Kursk Oblast, celebrating an unexpected blow to Moscow, Russian forces advanced with alarming speed in Ukraine's east.

'Bild has not seen the victory plan, and of the few people who are currently involved by the president in the preparation of the Victory Plan, none of them spoke to Bild.''Ukraine is against any freezing of the war, and this is said at all levels of the Ukrainian leadership. And it is important for us that the United States supports Ukraine's Victory Plan, not capitulation or freezing,' Lytvyn said.He added that the United States would be the first partner presented with the plan.Officials have so far been tight-lipped about the plan's details.Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine's operations in Kursk were part of his plan for victory.The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine's participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details.Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its inaugural global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was excluded.Kyiv has said it aims to invite a Russian representative to the second conference.Kyiv has repeatedly rejected any ceasefire or temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

It's pointless,' Zelensky said.'If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn't work.'The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine's victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election.'I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he's bringing,' Sullivan said.'And so we're very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation.'And it's only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.'Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remainUkraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.

We continue to drive on,' Kamyshin added.Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells.Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing 'desperately needed' NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the 'second half' of 2024 at the earliest.'This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,' Kamyshin said, adding that he 'can't say much' on the matter.Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacksWhile waiting for a green light from Western countries to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine is relying on domestically produced drones, which are considerably cheaper than missiles and no less effective.

The floods had claimed at least seven lives, as thousands of houses were damaged accross Europe, with tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate from the disaster areas.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he was moved by Ukraine's offer of help.'A moment ago, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal sent me expressions of solidarity with Poland and readiness to immediately send a hundred rescuers equipped with specialist equipment to fight the flood. Moving,' Tusk said on X.Czech Republic Foreign affairs minister Jan Lipavský confirmed the offer in a statement on X (Twitter). 'I will convey the offer at an emergency cabinet meeting,' Lipavský wrote.Ukraine has also suffered from a major humanitarian disaster caused by flooding after the Russian forces destroyed the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine's south on July 6, 2023, which Zelensky called one of Russia's 'most serious crimes against the environment and people.'In the Ukrainian-controlled part of the area flooded after the dam's destruction, emergency service rescuers and volunteers evacuated thousands of locals, even under heavy shelling from Russian forces.Since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine has sent its emergency service workers on a mission abroad at least once: to help Turkey after a deadly earthquake hit it on Feb. 6, 2023, claiming over 50,000 lives across Turkey and Syria.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offers-neighbor-countries-help-with-deadly-floods/	2024-09-15T12:47:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171350835.jpg

The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike list	In recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Russia has been able to attack Ukraine with relative impunity from its positions behind the border, while the U.S. and other suppliers of weapons have forbidden Ukraine from using their supplied weapons to strike back, often citing fears of escalation. There were signs that the tide was shifting over the past week. The Guardian reported that the U.K. had already decided to allow Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles for strikes in Russia. Politico wrote that the White House reportedly is discussing potential targets Ukraine could strike with its long-range weapons.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 11, 2024, amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine. (Mark Schiefelbein / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)But hopes of a positive announcement during meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington on Sept. 13 were dashed, and the decision-making process appears to have been postponed to the UN general assembly in New York later this month.A day later on Sept. 13 in Kyiv, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations.' Ukraine has been eagerly awaiting the potential lifting of restrictions, with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov saying in August that he had presented the U.S. with a list of proposed targets within Russia. Calling the lifting of restrictions a 'game changer is probably too strong a word,' Andreas Umland, analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.'But it would make a big difference of course. That's why the Ukrainians are so eager to get it.'Potential targetsA public list of targets — either those requested by Ukraine or approved by the U.S. or the U.K. — is unlikely for operational reasons. Western officials have been hesitant to openly talk about policy changes, likely out of concern that Russia will relocate potentially valuable targets out of reach before Ukraine is able to capitalize on its newfound range capabilities.But matching the ranges of the weapons available to Ukraine, to Russian positions on the other side of the border can shed light on what might be possible should the policy be officially changed. A report from the Institute for the Study of War last month identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary sites' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, which is currently the furthest range of any Western-supplied missiles available to Ukraine. A map based on data from an Institute for the Study of War (ISW) report on Aug. 27, 2024, which using open-source data, identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary objects' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, including air bases, headquarters, and training centers. (Institute for the Study of War/ Nizar Al-Rifai/ The Kyiv Independent)If placed close to Ukraine's front lines, the Western-supplied long-range weapons could potentially put vast swathes of Russian territory in the firing zone. The area includes military bases, airfields, troop concentrations, and ammunition depots.Numerous population centers would also be in range, including the cities of Rostov-on-Don (population 1.1 million), Voronezh (population 1 million), Krasnodar (population 1.1 million), Lipetsk (population 496,000), Bryansk (population 350,000), Smolensk (population 310,000), as well as the key port city of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea (population 262,000). This non-exhaustive list does not include cities in occupied Crimea or other parts of Ukraine under Russian control or cities in Russia that have already reportedly come under Ukrainian attack, such as Belgorod. Any change in policies is likely to come with strings attached and with the understanding that long-range strikes will be conducted in a defensive fashion on military targets. Some of the possible military targets in this area could include the following:Lipetsk military air base, struck by drones in AugustShatalovo air base in Smolensk OblastMillerovo military airfield in Rostov Oblast, damaged in a drone strike in JulyYeysk military airfield in Krasnodar Krai, damaged in drone strikes in June and AprilLogistics and command centers in Rostov-on-Don, which has been the central headquarters of Russia's full-scale invasion of UkraineThe Primorsko-Akhtarsk airbase in Krasnodar Krai, regularly used by Russia to launch Shahed-type drones at UkraineNovorossiysk naval base, where much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has relocated after a series of devastating attacks by Ukraine on its primary base off of occupied CrimeaA damaged car is seen at an undisclosed location in Russia's Belgorod Oblast overnight on Sept. 1, 2024 following a drone attack.

HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022.Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously.In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS - fired from HIMARS launchers - with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within.Ukrainian drones strike deeper into Russia, aiming to break war machine, sow discontentJust before sunrise on an otherwise sleepy weekend near Moscow, a Russian eyewitness of Ukraine's kamikaze drone attack on the Kashira Power Plant appeared stunned, unleashing an expletive-laden tirade with his wife alongside.

As the West dithered on its policy about long-range strikes, Ukraine has developed its own domestic arsenal of drones to attack targets inside Russia, hitting airbases, ammunition dumps, drone factories, and other military sites as far as 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) beyond the Ukrainian border. The U.S. began supplying Ukraine with an older model of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in the fall of 2023, which have a range of around 165 kilometers. In the spring of 2024, the New York Times reported that the U.S. had shipped around 100 updated versions of ATACMS missiles, which can reach up to 300 kilometers. Illustrative photo.

(John Keeble/Getty Images)Ukraine has put both variants of missiles into effect on the battlefield, striking targets in occupied Crimea and other parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. The U.K. began providing Ukraine with its long-range Storm Shadow missiles in May 2023. The missiles have a range of over 250 kilometers. The missiles have been deployed in a number of devastating attacks on Russian targets, such as a strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in occupied Crimea that reportedly killed dozens of Russian soldiers and officers. Although its official list of targets has not been revealed, Ukraine has repeatedly stated that it needs the ability to strike the Russian aircraft that launch mass missile attacks against Ukrainian cities, and the airfields from which they take off.'The Storm Shadow is best used against heavily protected buildings like bunkers or reinforced ammunition storage sites and headquarters,' Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent, adding: 'It isn't the best use of it to try and hit aircraft out on a runway, or against an airfield that is easy to repair.' 'There are such targets available in Russia, but they'll need to be carefully picked to maximize the impact, ideally timed to coincide with Ukrainian ground operations, destroying supplies that Russian ground units need.'Savill said that the cluster weapon version of ATACMS is ideally suited to striking Russian aircraft at Russian airfields, but added that a recent report that Moscow has already transferred around 90% of its military aircraft to bases outside their reach suggests their effect may now be limited.'This at least means (Russian aircraft) have to operate from further away, and can fly fewer sorties per day,' he said.'There will be Russian forces still in ATACMS range, but essentially it sounds as if the opportunity to do serious damage to the Russian air force on the ground has been missed, for now.'Despite potential missed opportunities, the lifting of restrictions will still be welcomed in Ukraine.'It will certainly make a lot of difference in the war, and will help protect Ukrainian cities from these ongoing missile terror attacks,' Umland said.Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacksWhile waiting for a green light from Western countries to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine is relying on domestically produced drones, which are considerably cheaper than missiles and no less effective.

Ukrainian military to launch new project in coming months to improve basic training, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working to improve the training quality for its military, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Sept. 15, and will roll out new plans over October and November. In a recent working meeting with military leaders and authorities responsible for military training, the group discussed problems related to military training and discussed strategies to solve them, Syrskyi said in a post on Facebook. 'Instructors play a key role in the quality of training. Therefore, we pay maximum attention to attracting motivated instructors with combat experience. We are also working on the possibility of creating an instructor school, which will be the main and only source of well-trained instructors,' Syrskyi wrote. 'We are working on increasing the term of basic combined military training. The corresponding project will be started in October-November of this year,' he added.In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. 'Considering training facilities, there are not enough of them. They are already being expanded,' Zelensky said. Ukraine's parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia's ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft and came into force on May 18.

Russian strike on high-rise in Kharkiv leaves at least 33 injured	Editor's note: This is a developing story.At least 33 people including three children were injured when a Russian air strike hit a high-rise building in Kharkiv city and caused a fire, authorities reported on Sept. 15.President Volodomyry Zelensky shared photos of the damage on his Telegram channel, saying rescue operations where ongoing and that the fire had spread through the 9th through 12th floors. Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Synehubov said three children were among the estimated 25 injured, with the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov later raising the known total to 33 injured. Shortly before the reported strike, Terekhov warned that Russia had launched several KABs, or guided bombs.

Media: Cyprus revokes citizenship of Ukrainian oligarch Kolomoisky	Cyrpus has stripped Ihor Kolomoisky's Cyrpus citizenship after concluding that the notorious Ukrainian oligarch had withheld vital information related to criminal charges he faces, Philenews reported. Kolomoisky, who was arrested last year in Ukraine, faces trial for alleged fraud, illegal acquisition of property, and money laundering related to his oil and gas holdings. The Prosecutor General's Office announced in May that Kolomoisky was also suspected of ordering the murder of the head of a law firm more than 20 years ago in Crimea.After reviewing the personal information submitted by Kolomoisky to obtain his citizenship under the so-called 'Golden Passport' program, which allows wealthy investors to obtain citizenship through financial investments, the E.U. country determined earlier this month that Kolomoisky's 'suspicious character' risked worsening Cyrpus's reputation, Philenews wrote. Ukraine's Bureau of Economic Security reported that it completed its pre-trial investigation into Kolomoisky on Aug. 21. The prosecutors said that part of the money Kolomoisky allegedly embezzled and transferred to his account, some Hr 2 billion ($48 million), was obtained at the expense of loans from PrivatBank, a Ukrainian bank formerly owned by Kolomoisky.The bureau also said its detectives proved that Kolomoisky had organized the illegal seizure of more than Hr 3.3 billion ($ 80 million) from Ukrnafta, Ukraine's largest oil producer previously affiliated with the oligarch.Kolomoisky, together with five associates, was charged by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) with embezzling Hr 9.2 billion ($223 million) from PrivatBank, the NABU announced on Sept. 7, 2024.Seven other wealthy individuals also lost their citizenship as part of the same review by Cyrpus authorities of personal data submitted during citizenship applications.

Zelensky's office denies report that victory plan includes ceasefire along existing lines	An advisor for President Volodymyr Zelensky denied a news report suggesting Zelensky's new victory plan will include a partial ceasefire, calling it a 'fake.' Zelensky has said he will present the United States with a plan for Ukraine's victory later this month during a meeting with Biden. Responding on Sept. 15 to an article published by Germany's Bild newspaper, Presidential Communications Advisor Dmytro Lytvyn told Ukrainska Pravda, that the claim was untrue.'Bild spread a fake,' Lytvyn said. 'Bild has not seen the victory plan, and of the few people who are currently involved by the president in the preparation of the Victory Plan, none of them spoke to Bild.''Ukraine is against any freezing of the war, and this is said at all levels of the Ukrainian leadership. And it is important for us that the United States supports Ukraine's Victory Plan, not capitulation or freezing,' Lytvyn said. He added that the United States would be the first partner presented with the plan. Officials have so far been tight-lipped about the plan's details. Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine's operations in Kursk were part of his plan for victory.The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine's participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details.Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its inaugural global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was excluded.

Russians' faith in their country's safety 'broken' by Ukraine's deep strikes, Budanov says	Ukraine's strikes deep into Russian territory have 'broken' the faith Russian people hold that their country is powerful and safe, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on Sept. 14.Speaking during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, Budanov said the strikes have had a 'serious effect on the social-psychological situation,' adding that 'the (Russian) people's belief in that they live in a safe country has been broken. It is the main achievement of all these deep strikes.''The comments come amid intense debate between Ukraine and its allies over the issue of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with foreign-provided weapons. Ukraine has for months requested permission to use foreign weapons to strike within Russian territory, but many partners including the U.S. and Germany have refused over fears of escalation. Ukraine has instead used domestically-produced drones to target Russian cities in mass attacks, ramping up these attacks in recent weeks. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.However, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles, with some reports that the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.At the summit, Budanov also expressed concern about North Korea's supply of ballistic missiles to Russia and predicted that Russia may be forced to conduct another wave of mobilization in summer 2025.

Ukrainian military receives 18 Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark	The Ukrainian military has been handed the 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana self-propelled howitzers financed by Denmark, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced.Mountable on a number of different truck chassis setups, the Bohdana is the first Ukrainian-made artillery piece to be manufactured in the 155mm NATO-standard caliber.Poulsen made his remarks on Sept. 14 during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, according to the news outlet RBC-Ukraine. The minister added that producing weapons domestically in Ukraine is cheaper and more efficient than in the West, and called on other European countries to do the same. Kyiv has sought to convince allied countries to donate arms to Ukraine's military via direct purchases from Ukrainian companies, as Kyiv's defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. A self-propelled howitzer can drive into position, fire off multiple rounds in under a minute, and be out of range of counterfire before the enemy has had time to organize, giving it a speed advantage over artillery units that are towed into place. In development for years before the outset of the full-scale invasion, the Bohdana was first used in combat in summer 2022, firing upon Russian positions on Snake Island in the Black Sea.The order for the 18 Bohdana artillery units was placed in July of this year. In July, the Strategic Industries Ministry said that foreign partners had so far pledged to invest around $675 million in the Ukrainian defense industry to arm Kyiv's forces. 18 Bohdana howitzers heading for Ukraine's battlefield - here's what they can doUkraine's artillery capabilities have received a welcome boost with the news that 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark will be delivered within the coming months.

According to Russia's Defense Ministry, which posted its statement on Telegram, fifteen of the drones were shot down over Bryansk Oblast, five over Kursk, four over Smolensk, two over Oryol, and one each over Belgorod, Kaluga, and Rostov Oblasts. In recent months, Kyiv stepped up its number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine.Earlier in the week, Moscow claimed that Ukraine had attacked overnight with 144 drones, making the attack potentially among the largest strikes throughout the war.

Biden administration requests extension of nearly $6 billion military funding for Ukraine	U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has requested Congress to extend the authority of 'presidential write-offs' for supplying weapons to Ukraine until 2025, so that the remaining $5.8 billion can be used beyond the fiscal year ending on September 30.Under current rules, the funds will expire if not used by that deadline.The Pentagon is working with Congress to ensure the extension, which would allow continued military aid to Ukraine.If the extension isn't granted, the White House may announce a large aid package by October 1, but this approach could present logistical challenges, such as lack of available resources.Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently announced over $700 million in aid to Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv.The U.S. will provide $325 million to help repair Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which requires strengthening ahead of winter and expectations of a renewed campaign of Russian strikes.The package also includes $290 million in humanitarian aid, which will support 'millions of people in Ukraine and the surrounding region who have been forced to flee their homes,' Blinken said.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-requests-extension-of-5-8-billion-military-funding-for-ukraine/	2024-09-14T20:23:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/ezgif-1-86d0505a8b.jpg
Budanov discusses Russia's strategy and North Korean involvement at YES meeting in Kyiv	Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, delivered multiple statements during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv.Budanov expressed concern over North Korea's significant military support to Russia, particularly its supply of ballistic missiles.When asked to rank the countries offering the most military support to Russia, Budanov placed North Korea at the top, stating that 'North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else,' highlighting the unmatched volume of supplies North Korea provides.He added that Russia has significantly ramped up its missile production, including Iskander missiles and guided aerial bombs.In another interview, Budanov said that Russia aims to end the war by the end of 2025 or early 2026, due to expected economic and social crises.He noted that by summer 2025, Russia will face serious economic problems and may be forced into further mobilization.'They (Russia) predict that around the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will be very noticeable for their country,' Budanov said. In February 2024, U.S. intelligence estimated that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on military operations in Ukraine. The war has cost Russia up to $1.3 trillion in lost economic growth through 2026, an undisclosed source in U.S. intelligence in a comment to Reuters.NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg saysStoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-discusses-russias-strategy-and-north-korean-involvement-at-yes-meeting-in-kyiv/	2024-09-14T17:06:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg
Ukraine launched production of 155-mm artillery shells, official says	Ukraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, newly appointed by President Zelensky as external adviser for strategic issues.Kamishyn, who resigned from his post as Strategic Industries Minister during the biggest wartime government reshuffle on Sept. 4, told Norwegian media Nettavisen that Ukraine's production of defense material doubled under his leadership.'By the end of the year, it will have tripled. We continue to drive on,' Kamishyn added.Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells.Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing 'desperately needed' NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the 'second half' of 2024 at the earliest.'This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,' Kamyshin said, adding that he 'can't say much' on the matter.Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-production-of-155-mm-artillery-shells-official-says/	2024-09-14T15:06:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-8.jpg
Germany won't allow long-range strikes on Russia even if other countries do, Scholz says	Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front 'even if other countries decide otherwise,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.His statement comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, while media continue to report on encouraging signs that the ban might be reversed.Scholz said during the public talk in Prenzlau, Brandenburg that Germany 'will continue to support Ukraine militarily' so that the country 'does not collapse,' German media Welt reported.However, Scholz stressed that he would remain opposed to the idea of Ukraine using German long-range weapons to attack targets deep inside Russia. 'I am sticking to my position, even if other countries decide differently,' Scholz said.Commenting on media reports that the U.S. could lift the existing restrictions, he said that not all speculations are correct, according to Welt.Restrictions on the usage of U.S.-made and provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sept. 14.According to earlier media reports on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of the plan to lift some restrictions, while the U.K. had reportedly privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made.Meanwhile, German media Spiegel reported on Sept. 13 that the debate is also ongoing inside the German parliament on whether Ukraine should be provided with German long-range missiles Taurus, with politicians from the FDP and the Greens supporting the decision. Ukraine has long been urging the West to lift the ban on striking military targets deep inside Russia. On Sept. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his speech at the YES conference that without the ability to strike inside Russia, U.S.-provided ATACAMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) are 'pointless.'ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-allow-long-range-strikes-on-russia-even-if-other-countries-do-scholz-says/	2024-09-14T12:32:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1834521425.jpeg
ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan says	Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 14.Speaking at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Sullivan reiterated that no decision had yet been made, a day after President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington to discuss the issue.Ukraine had been hoping for permission to be granted during the talks to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles - Storm Shadow and ATACMS - to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.But Starmer left Washington with no such announcement being made, putting Kyiv's hopes on hold once again.'I understand Ukraine's perspective on it,' Sullivan said, adding: 'But rather than me trying to elaborate on the reasoning one way or the other, this is something that I think is the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky.'Zelensky is due to travel to New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly.Speaking at the same conference a day earlier, Zelensky said the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles are 'pointless' in Ukraine due to their limited quantity and restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia imposed by Western partners.The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.'ATACMS in the form that we have today (in Ukraine) is pointless if you cannot use it on their (Russian) military bases, airfields with helicopters and airplanes. It's pointless,' Zelensky said.'If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn't work.'The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine's victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election.'I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he's bringing,' Sullivan said.'And so we're very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation.'And it's only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.'Russia launches counteroffensive in Kursk - can it push Ukraine off its own turf?More than a month after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion into Russian territory, Russian forces have begun counterattacking in Kursk Oblast, aiming to eventually drive Ukrainian troops out of the partially occupied border region.

From strangers to friends: How Ukrainians meet and bond during wartime train travel	For the past eight years, Anton Lytvynov, a stage director at Lviv National Opera, has celebrated New Year in Kyiv with his three friends - Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr.However, on Dec. 31, 2022, work commitments kept Lytvynov in Lviv longer than he had expected. Determined to reunite with his closest friends all the same, Lytvynov decided to ring in the New Year on the train, planning to meet with them on Jan. 1.Late at night, he traversed the empty, narrow corridor of the Lviv-Kyiv train to his dimly lit yet warm compartment. As the train gradually set off, the sound of its wheels on the tracks built into a steady rumble.Thus began a journey that would prove as exciting as the destination itself.Sitting alone on one of his compartment's dark-red leather beds, Lytvynov overheard people speaking loudly in the compartment next to his.'I went to them to ask if they wanted to celebrate the New Year together, and they agreed,' Lytvynov says.The moment he heard the names of his fellow travelers, Lytvynov was thunderstruck: The people sitting next to him were named Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr - just like the friends he was traveling to see.People on the escalator at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

(Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)'It felt like a scene from a TV series,' Lytvynov laughs. The four bonded instantly, exchanged contact information, and remain in touch to this day.Since Ukraine shut down its airports in February 2022, trains operated by the state-owned railway, Ukrzaliznytsia, have become one of the primary and perhaps the easiest means of travel both within Ukraine and abroad. Countless fascinating encounters and stories unfolded in the corridors and compartments of Ukrainian trains since then.Tetiana Kohut, a 37-year-old train attendant, often sees strangers find common ground while traveling. It's not surprising, she notes: in the intimate space of a train compartment during long journeys, shared everyday rituals - like sleeping or sipping tea - create a cozy atmosphere, naturally fostering connections among passengers.Trains have also evolved into unexpected hubs for celebrity encounters and important connections, often paving the way to shared projects and other new opportunities.War changes everythingSince the start of Russia's full-scale war, Ukrainian trains have borne witness to more tears of sorrow, sadness, and grief than ever before.Just a day after Russian troops began heavily bombarding Ukrainian cities in late February 2022, Kohut was working on her regular route from Lviv, her hometown, to Novooleksiivka in Kherson Oblast. But her train never reached the destination. The village, located on the east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, was swiftly occupied by the Russians.'We reached Zaporizhzhia and were told that we could not go further,' Kohut says. 'We also were ordered to allow everyone on the train, not only those with tickets. We became an evacuation train.'A train attendant of nearly 20 years, Kohut heard the sounds of explosions for the first time that day in Zaporizhzhia. She also saw hundreds of people at the station. Many of them were crying, and others looked lost and heartbroken, leaving suitcases on the platform as they boarded the lifesaving train to escape the war.The first-class sleeping car she worked in was designed to accommodate 20 people but ended up carrying nearly 200, Kohut says. 'A woman from Zaporizhzhia helped me count the passengers and wrote a heartwarming letter to thank us.'People walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut checks the tickets of passengers before departure to Lviv at a railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)The start of the all-out war changed everything for Kohut and many other train attendants across Ukraine. In the first few months of the invasion, they worked without breaks, despite their exhaustion, to ensure everyone who wanted to escape the war could board their trains. The war also heightened the hazards of their work, as Russian attacks occasionally target train stations. Over 600 Ukrzaliznytsia employees have been killed since Feb. 24, 2022.Kohut says she lost colleagues in the Aug. 24, 2022 Russian attack on Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, when a passenger train and a residential area were hit, killing a total of 25 people. One of her close friends, a fellow train attendant, was seriously injured in the attack.Once filled with laughter and excitement for upcoming travels, the train cars are now often filled with crying, silence, or the heavy sighs of people sharing the pain brought by Russia's war. 'We have to be doctors... We have to be psychologists for our passengers now,' says Kohut.Despite the dangers, trains have been also the primary means of traveling to Ukraine for many of the world's top politicians and celebrities, with over 700 diplomatic missions arriving in Ukraine by train since the start of the invasion.U.S. President Joe Biden walks along the train platform after a surprise visit to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 20, 2023.

(EU Commission/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Kohut has had the fortune to work on many such routes, and has met former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Polish President Andrzej Duda, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others.'Right now, all the world-famous celebrities are traveling (to Ukraine) by train. I only ever saw them on TV before, and serving them now is just so pleasant, it's indescribable,' says Kohut.Unexpected tearsA chance encounter on a train initially brought tears to the eyes of Kyiv resident Olha Hrianyk, and led her to experience grief she thought she would never endure again.Hrianyk, 63, and her husband were traveling from Chernivtsi to the capital last May when a tall young man entered their compartment. The couple noticed a very familiar and cherished unit badge on his backpack.''Are you from the Azov brigade?' My husband asked,' Hrianyk recalls. 'He said: 'How do you know?'''I told him that our son was an Azov fighter.'Hrianyk's son Oleksandr helped liberate Kyiv Oblast in the early months of the full-scale war. He was then transferred to defend Mariupol, ending up at the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city, where he was killed on May 8, 2022. He was 29.Evening railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut before departure to Lviv at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Vladyslav, the young man they accidentally met on the train, was undergoing training to join Azov. Some of his commanders had known Hrianyk's son Oleksandr well: 'He told us it was a great honor for him to meet us,' Hrianyk says.The elderly couple and the young soldier talked until late at night, opening their hearts and sharing stories about military service and the war: 'I looked at him thinking, 'Son, you're so bright, you're so proud to be there (in Azov). What amazing young people we have,'' says Hrianyk.'In that brief time, that child became like family to me.'They shared phone numbers and kept in touch with Vladyslav while he was undergoing military training in Kyiv, often inviting him over for dinner or simply to rest after being on duty.One day last September, Vladyslav's mother suddenly called Hrianyk, expressing relief at finally contacting the couple her son had accidentally met on the train and had told her a lot about. But then she delivered some heartbreaking news: Vladyslav had been killed in combat near Bakhmut. He was only 19.'We printed his portrait and put it at the fallen soldiers' memorial (next to the St. Michael's Cathedral in Kyiv). (The portrait of) our Oleksandr is there too,' Hrianyk says.'Now, as we come there to see our Sasha, we come to see Vlad, too.'Turning words into actionsFor many Ukrainians, meetings on trains have sparked new ideas and fruitful collaborations for their projects or businesses.Vinnytsia-based Nataliia Kovalchuk, a content creator for an NGO called the National Network of Local Philanthropy Development, recalls numerous captivating experiences during her work trips across Ukraine.People talk on the phones inside the train on the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)'My team laughs at me when I say, 'You'll never believe it, but I met someone on the train again,'' Kovalchuk says.During her railway journeys, Kovalchuk always buys a cup of hot tea - a true gem of Ukrainian train travel, served by train attendants in a special glass with a metal cup holder. Little did she know that accidentally spilling her tea onto a nearby passenger's belongings would lead to another valuable connection.Surprisingly, the spilled tea did not lead to bad feelings, but helped Kovalchuk bond with the woman whose belongings she had soaked. It turned out that the woman worked at a center for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers.Kovalchuk donated some books for the soldiers undergoing rehabilitation there and helped the center boost its social media presence to attract more funding in the future.Now she is planning to invite some of the war veterans from the center to give a lecture to local young people and her organization on inclusivity and treatment of people with disabilities in Ukraine.And all this became possible thanks to a chance encounter on a train.As the evening comes down, people walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

3 killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, governor says	A Russian attack killed three civilians in the Huliaipole community, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported on Sept. 14.Fedorov said in a statement on social media that Russian forces struck the territory of an agricultural enterprise, without specifying the type of weapon used. All three victims were the enterprise's employees, he added.The front-line community of Huliaipole has about 20,000 residents. It has been subjected to constant attacks from Russian positions in the south over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion. The town lies less than 10 kilometers north of the front line and some 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhzhia.Fedorov reported earlier that Huliaipole was attacked with artillery and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) of different modifications over the past day. https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-103-pows-including-23-azov-fighters/	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-3-killed-in-russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2024-09-14T09:35:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-03_00-04-14.jpg

Some Ukrainian POWs died in captivity from causes such as 'blunt force trauma'.This is the 57th prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and the second exchange carried out in the last two days.

NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg says	NATO could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview published Sept. 14.'Now we provide military stuff to a war — then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,' he told the German newspaper FAS.Stoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, will take his place.'I wasn't surprised because we knew from the intelligence services what was going to happen,' he said.'But seeing it actually happen still shocked me. I realized that this was a turning point in our history: There is a Europe before that day and a different Europe after that day.'Stoltenberg highlighted NATO's reluctance to send weapons Ukraine was asking for before the launch of the full-scale invasion, over Western fears of escalation, something which continues to this day and has led to long delays in weapons systems such as tanks and fighter jets.He also said the war would only end with 'dialogue with Russia at a certain stage,' but added it 'has to be based on Ukrainian strength.'Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. Multiple NATO countries, including Slovakia and Hungary have questioned NATO's commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war, calling instead for a peace agreement.During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine's 'irreversible' path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance's ongoing commitments to Kyiv 'constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership.'NATO allies also announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros ($43 billion), a new military command in Germany to train and equip Ukrainian troops, and further air defense commitments.Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remainUkraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.

Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remain	Ukraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.Anticipation had been high ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but the White House dampened expectations even before the pair had finished talks.'There is no change to our view on the provision of long-range strike capabilities for Ukraine to use inside of Russia,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.Ukraine was hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.With the bans in place, Kyiv says it cannot effectively defend Ukrainian cities from intensifying aerial attacks.The two missiles are the U.S.-supplied ATACMS, a short-range supersonic tactical ballistic missile, and the U.K.-France-supplied Storm Shadow.Both Storm Shadows and ATACMS were initially given to Kyiv on the provision that they only be used to strike Russian targets within Ukraine or in Russian-occupied parts of the country.Western fears of escalating the war with Russia have been behind the restrictions.The tide began to shift after Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, when the U.S. and other Western allies eased restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike targets with Western weapons— in a defensive fashion — inside Russia.In the lead up to Starmer and Biden meeting on Sept. 13, multiple media reports suggested both countries might be on the verge of allowing Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.According to Politico, on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of a plan to lift some restrictions.On the same day, the Guardian reported that the U.K. had already privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made at the time.Hopes were understandably high that an announcement would come after the meeting between Biden and Starmer.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Starmer said the meeting with Biden had been a 'wide-ranging discussion about strategy' rather than a decision-making process about 'a particular capability.''We've had a long and productive discussion on a number of problems, including Ukraine, as you'd expect, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, talking strategically about tactical decisions,' he said.According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.The White House said the meeting between the two leaders was called at the request of the U.K., and according to The New York Times (NYT), Britain wants explicit permission from Biden so a coordinated strategy can be presented.While Kirby was very clear that a decision was not coming on Sept, 13, he didn't rule out that one could be made in the near future.According to the Guardian, Starmer suggested the plan would be further discussed 'with a wider group of individuals' at the UN general assembly in New York later this month.The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that the Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have upped their saber-rattling in response, claiming that the move would mean NATO is directly at war with Russia.'I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,' Biden said when asked on Sept. 13 what he thought about the Russian president's remarks.The long-range missiles Ukraine could soon be firing deep into RussiaThe U.S. and U.K. may be on the verge of what could be a hugely significant move regarding the war in Ukraine, with reports suggesting both countries might soon allow Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.

Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive'	President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed Donald Trump told him during a call in July he is 'very supportive,' and would do 'everything to strengthen Ukraine' if elected president.In a preview clip of an interview with CNN to be aired on Sept. 15, Zelensky said Trump also told him 'he understands how difficult it is to survive during the war.'The comments are at odds with Trump's previous public statements on Ukraine.During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, the former president reiterated earlier statements that his primary concern was ending the war - which he has previously claimed he could do in 24 hours - but refrained from providing any concrete details.Media reports indicated that Trump privately suggested he would end Russia's war by pressuring Ukraine to cede occupied Crimea and Donbas to Moscow. He voiced strong criticism of American aid to Ukraine at a campaign rally in Detroit on June 15, describing Zelensky as 'maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived' for securing substantial financial support from the U.S.The U.S. has provided historic levels of foreign aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, sending over $100 billion in military assistance and budget support critical to fighting off Russia and helping the government continue to operate.During the debate, Trump also refused to answer whether Ukraine being victorious was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was in America's 'best interest to get this war finished and negotiate a deal.'Trump's vice-presidential running mate Sen. J.D. Vance said in an interview on Sept. 12 that Donald Trump's plan to end Russia's war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia, among other arrangements.When asked by CNN's Fareed Zakaria how Zelensky understands Trump's comments that he would end the war in 24 hours, Zelensky dismissed the comments as 'election messages,' that may not reflect what his actual policies will be if he is elected president.'I can't understand it for today because I don't know the details — what he means and what does it mean,' Zelensky said, referring to Trump's alleged plan.'My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,' Zelensky said during a clip of the interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15.Zelensky did however acknowledge that Trump's statements have made some Ukrainians 'nervous.'Zelensky will visit the U.S. later this month to present President Joe Biden with a 'victory plan,' which he told CNN would also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, ahead of the upcoming November presidential election.Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have stressed that Kyiv will continue to cooperate productively with any U.S. administration, regardless of the outcome of the November election.Is 'Russians at War' propaganda?

Red Cross says it has suspended operations at Dnipro office following attack that killed, injured employees	A spokesperson for the Ukrainian delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross says that the organization has suspended operations at its Dnipro office after three of its employees were killed in a strike on Sept. 12.Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka, hitting the territory of the enterprise, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said.The attack destroyed a truck with humanitarian aid and a car, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others.'For now, our Dnipro office has suspended operations for some time,' Spokesperson Oleksandr Vlasenko said following the attack. Vlasenko did not specify when the office is expected to reopen. Although the attack did not target the office, regular Russian attacks on the region have continued to pose a serious risk to Red Cross employees stationed along the front line.In a statement, the Red Cross said that its team was preparing to distribute firewood and fuel briquettes north of Donetsk to residents when the attack occurred.Had the employees been actively distributing the materials when the attack occurred, 'there could have been much more casualties,' Vlasenko said.The Red Cross has not pointed the blame on Russia for the attack, with Vlasenko adding that the organization 'does not know exactly' who has committed the attack. In response to the Red Cross' hesitation to directly blame Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was 'disappointing to see that the Red Cross, in its official communication afraid to even say it was a Russian strike.''This is our life, but it's their face. And this is not just the truth - it's a Russian strike - it is Russian terror,' Zelensky added.Russia has regularly attacked the regions lying on Ukraine's easter front with missile, guided bomb, and drones.
