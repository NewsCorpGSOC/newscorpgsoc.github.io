British volunteer who lost arm and leg evacuating Ukrainian civilians: ‘Russia is the enemy. How can you not see it?’	It could have been a tragic story costing British volunteer Edward Scott his life. As a humanitarian aid worker with the Ukrainian NGO &quot;Baza&quot; (the &quot;Base&quot; in Ukrainian), 28-year-old Scott has made multiple trips to the front-line areas to evacuate civilian Ukrainians. But the mission on Jan. 30 to the embattled city of Pokrovsk in southern Donetsk Oblast was different. A Russian drone targeted the vehicle of Scott&#x2019;s crew &#x2013; though it was marked with a bright sign reading &quot;evacuation.&quot; The car was carrying two civilians and two volunteers. The driver&apos;s seat &#x2014; where Scott had been sitting &#x2013; was hit hardest, leaving him severely injured. As Russian forces continue to rapidly advance in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian government and volunteers have intensified efforts to evacuate civilians from front-line towns in Donetsk Oblast. With Russian forces just mere kilometers away, Pokrovsk remains under constant artillery and drone attacks, making evacuation missions a high-risk endeavor. &#x201C;(There was) massive explosion. I see this fireball, and the car is knocked out of gear,&quot; Scott recalls the moment of impact. &quot;I&apos;m trying to force it in gear, but my foot is not working, and at the same time, I&apos;m trying to turn the wheel, and I can feel my shoulder turning, but I can see my arm on the wheel, not turning, so I&apos;m like &apos;This is bad.&apos;&quot; &quot;And then the pain hits me, and I start screaming.&quot; What happened next was a brilliant coordination of actions that saved Scott&apos;s life. Seconds after the attack, his mission partner, Pylyp Rozhdestvenskyi, was applying tourniquets to his shredded arm and leg to stop the bleeding. Minutes later, Scott was already in a military car on his way to the neighboring hospital for medical assistance. There, he received a transfusion of about four liters of blood, but severe injuries resulted in amputations of his left arm and leg. Weeks after the brutal attack, with multiple surgeries behind him and more still ahead, Scott, now undergoing treatment at a Kyiv hospital, thinks about how he can continue helping Ukraine &#x2014; the country he now calls home. &quot;I want to primarily help Ukrainians but also show the world that we are fighting people who will happily commit war crimes at the drop of a hat,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent from his hospital bed. Scott paid his first visit to Ukraine in October 2022. By the time Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war began in February that year, he was already becoming more &quot;politically engaged&quot; and &quot;disillusioned&quot; with his former life as a sailor. &quot;It was a fantastic job,&quot; he says. &quot;I had amazing adventures and sailed across the Atlantic nine times. I&apos;ve been to beautiful places. But at the end of the day, I wasn&apos;t helping anyone.&quot; As he was following the U.K. soldiers fighting in Ukraine and humanitarian workers operating there on social media, Scott began to think: &quot;Maybe I can do that.&quot; &quot;So I bought a pickup truck and just drove to Ukraine,&quot; he recalls. &quot;My plan was to come here for three months, to make a difference, to donate a truck at the end of it, and go back to boats.&quot; Edward Scott (L) during his volunteering in Ukraine. (Courtesy)&quot;But very early on, I thought: &apos;No, this is the place to be.&apos;&quot; Since then, Scott has visited some of Ukraine&apos;s hardest-hit areas, including the now-destroyed and occupied city of Bakhmut, delivering various equipment and humanitarian aid. He also supported Ukrainians by helping repair the roofs of their homes alongside other volunteers from the Base NGO. The more he traveled through Ukraine meeting its people, the deeper his appreciation for the country and its culture has become. One of his warmest memories was when an elderly woman gave the volunteers the best homemade meal and care after they helped with repairs at her home. &quot;I met amazing people here,&quot; Scott says, adding that he even became a godfather to the daughter of one of his Ukrainian friends. &quot;I have a family here now.&quot; In December, as intense battles unfolded in the Pokrovsk area, Scott was called to assist with the civilian evacuation effort there. He had just started his second two-week rotation there when he noticed that &quot;things had deteriorated massively.&quot; &quot;(When we started) we could still drive through Pokrovsk, it was kind of okay,&quot; Scott says. &quot;We evacuated people from the last apartment block in the south (of the city).&quot; Edward Scott (L) evacuating a civilian in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 27, 2024. (Madison Tuff)Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 19, 2025. (Madison Tuff)&quot;But suddenly, we could no longer go south.&quot; Scott says that each time they entered the area, they could either see Russian drones on the ground or hear them in the air. &quot;The last few days before the hit there were a lot of them.&quot; &quot;We were very aware that it&apos;s very dangerous and we thought we were protecting ourselves by being as civilian as possible, showing that we are not a target. But we got hit as well,&quot; he says. Scott and Rozhdestvenskyi, 31, left their base in the city of Kramatorsk at around 8:20 a.m., heading to Pokrovsk to evacuate a woman whose husband was hit by a Russian drone in his car just a day before. When they found out the woman had fled with another crew, the two started looking for other locals who needed assistance. They ended up evacuating three people in their first drive and returned to pick up two more. According to Rozhdestvenskyi, the road they took was in &quot;quite bad condition,&quot; so the team had to drive relatively slowly. That was when the drone hit their car. &quot;I wasn&apos;t in shock because I had a similar situation two months ago, and I more or less understood what had happened. But this time, the explosion was more powerful than the previous one,&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi says. &quot;Looking at the pictures of the van now, I realize that they didn&apos;t just target the van; they targeted me. They targeted the driver,&quot; Scott says. He was the only one severely injured. A heavily damaged evacuation vehicle is seen with parts of its structure torn apart, in an unspecified location in Ukraine.(Screenshot)When he saw that their car no longer had a roof, Rozhdestvenskyi realized that if there was a second drone attack to follow, they wouldn&apos;t survive. He decided to act immediately. He got out of the car and applied tourniquets on the shredded arm and leg of his mission partner. &quot;I wasn&apos;t sure the tourniquet would work because there were just bones in front of my eyes,&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi says. As he was providing first aid, Rozhdestvenskyi spotted a military vehicle and shouted to the soldier asking for help. He grabbed Scott under his arms, pulled him out of the car, and carried him to the military pickup bed. Scott says he was conscious and remembers the ride. &quot;I could feel myself lying in the back of the truck, and the roads were terrible, so we were obviously moving pretty fast. I was being jostled around with horrific levels of pain,&quot; Scott says. &quot;I remember the weight of my arm on my chest. I was holding my wrist because my arm kept on falling off my chest.&quot; They quickly reached a small medical point nearby, where paramedics and a casevac were already waiting for them to head to the hospital. Rozhdestvenskyi says it took them around 40 minutes from the moment of the attack to reach a hospital in nearby Dobropillia. Upon arrival, Scott had suffered such massive blood loss that doctors had to transfuse around four liters of blood and perform the amputations. But thanks to the unified effort of Rozhdestvenskyi and the military, Scott&apos;s life was saved. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; BASE UA &#x2014; NGO in Donetsk region (@base_ua_ngo) &quot;I&apos;m lucky in so many ways as so many little things that&#x2026; (could have gone wrong),&quot; he says. Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office told the Kyiv Independent that they were investigating the attack as a potential war crime. A video showing Scott hugging Rozhdestvenskyi at the hospital in Dnipro, where he was transported shortly after the surgery, and thanking him for saving his life went viral across social media. &quot;He did; he really saved my life,&quot; Scott says. &quot;He was the one that did the hard work.&quot; &quot;He is a hero.&quot; Rozhdestvenskyi returns the compliments, saying that Scott &#x201C;is a very tough guy for his age.&#x201D; &quot;He always had a firm stance on helping people and his mission in Ukraine, and I was always impressed by that.&quot; After waking up after surgery, Scott was told that a medevac flight to the U.K. was being prepared for him. &#x201C;The first thing I said was, &#x2018;I&apos;m staying in Ukraine.&#x2019; I turned it down right away.&apos;&quot; His treatment in Ukraine was funded by the U.S. RT Weatherman Foundation, which says it was &#x201C;an honor&#x201D; to help Scott. &#x201C;We were touched by Eddie&#x2019;s service to Ukraine and his sacrifice for its people. &#xA0;When we were asked to help, the RT Weatherman Foundation didn&#x2019;t hesitate &#x2014; days after his injury, we evacuated him from Dnipro to Kyiv so that he could recuperate in the best possible conditions,&#x201D; the foundation&#x2019;s program manager in Ukraine, Roman Zhura, told the Kyiv Independent. Scott&#x2019;s parents visited him in Kyiv, with Ukraine quickly growing on them too. &quot;I&apos;ve changed my life, for better or for worse, but I&apos;ve suddenly changed my family&apos;s. Now (my dad) is telling everyone (in the U.K.): &apos;Ukraine&apos;s amazing.&apos;&quot; Edward Scott in the Hospital in Kyiv on Feb. 14, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi)Supported by his dearest friends, Scott not only envisions his future in Ukraine but also sees a new mission for himself: to advocate for the country and its people, helping in any way he can. Through his difficult journey in Ukraine, Scott says he realized that empathy is something &quot;essential for survival&quot; and something that is &quot;abundant in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;People in the West just lack empathy,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s a serious lack of empathy, especially considering that we&apos;re still fighting this war, three years into the full-scale invasion. And people are still debating whether Russia is the enemy. How can you not see it?&quot; &quot;Russia invaded this country, and that alone should be enough to show who the enemy is. The fact that people still don&apos;t see that and continue to believe the lies coming from the Kremlin &#x2014; it&apos;s a serious lack of empathy, and it&apos;s a real problem,&quot; he says. &#xA0; Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression. By telling all those painful stories, we are helping to keep the world informed about the reality of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. By becoming the Kyiv Independent&apos;s member, you can help us continue telling the world the truth about this war.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-volunteer-who-lost-arm-and-leg-evacuating-ukrainian-civilians-russia-is-the-enemy-how-can-you-not-see-it/	2025-02-19T11:27:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/02_02_25_madisontuff_eddy_in_hospital-8.jpg
US-Russia talks are 'the last warning for Europe,' Gabrielius Landsbergis says	Storm clouds are intensifying in Europe as Ukraine approaches the fourth year of the full-scale war with Russia. Initial hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new administration might adopt the &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach towards Moscow are beginning to unravel in light of recent statements from Washington. Both Trump and his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made it clear they do not see Ukraine joining NATO, a step envisioned by Kyiv as not only the best possible security guarantee but its key geopolitical goal. Speaking in Brussels at a Ramstein-format summit, the Pentagon chief also claimed that restoring Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;unrealistic&quot; and signaled the U.S.&apos;s attention is no longer focused on the European continent. Adding to tensions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s foreign minister between 2020 and 2024, says that if there ever was the &quot;last warning&quot; for Europe, this was it. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Landsbergis on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, where the growing divergence between the U.S. and the EU on NATO and Ukraine was at the center of the discussions. Lithuania&apos;s former chief diplomat, a long-time advocate for more decisive support for Ukraine, laid out how Europe can still turn the tide and help Kyiv achieve a just and lasting peace. Because if Europe doesn&apos;t wake up now, he says, &quot;we might have to declare it dead.&quot; The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your reaction to recent statements by top U.S. officials &#x2014; before negotiations even began &#x2014; that Ukraine might not be able to join NATO, that it will not be able to return to pre-2014 borders? Gabrielius Landsbergis: It&apos;s giving all the leverage to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and basically declaring that everything he wanted to achieve with his war against Ukraine, he might get it. So it&apos;s understandable that for many Ukrainians and for many of those who support Ukraine, it sounds like a betrayal. But some of the statements were contradicted just recently again, so it is indeed very confusing. I just hope that Putin is as confused as we are. The Kyiv Independent: U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin are planning to meet. What can European countries do to make sure that Europe and Ukraine are not left out of the negotiation process? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I think you see the way it might happen, and there&apos;s very little that we can do. Putin can meet Trump. They will meet, they will talk, they will call it peace negotiations, and they will declare something. But it doesn&apos;t necessarily need to change the reality on the ground. From Putin&apos;s perspective, it definitely won&apos;t. I don&apos;t think he will stop for any reason. He will put the blame on Ukrainians, on Europeans. Trump might do the same thing. So I think we have to prepare for what&apos;s after. And in this, my only hope is the now absolute and horrible cliche, that Europe wakes up. Because if it doesn&apos;t wake up, we might have to declare it dead. If there&apos;s ever a last warning, it is now. And there are things that Europe can do, honestly. We pride ourselves on a huge economy, 450 million people. (Russia&apos;s economy) is just the size of Spain&apos;s.

(Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)We have to put something on the table. We have the ability to support Ukraine militarily. We can integrate Ukraine into the European Union. This is one of the instruments that Europe used in the past. And if we take it seriously, we can do that very, very fast. I&apos;m not talking about cutting corners, but basically just guiding (Ukraine) through the process so that it is clear that if Russia decides to attack again, it will attack a country of the European Union. That changes the perception. We can arm Ukraine, we can arm ourselves, we can do many things. The Kyiv Independent: You think that membership in the EU can work as some sort of security guarantee for Ukraine? Gabrielius Landsbergis: Yes, indeed. Or at least (it can work as) deterrence. (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron mentioned a while ago that if Russian troops advance, they might encounter French troops in Odesa. Many in Europe freaked out, saying &quot;it&apos;s not needed yet,&quot; or &quot;maybe we can talk about this later in a different format.&quot; I think this is the time to talk about this. Let&apos;s put European troops in Ukraine and promise to fight alongside Ukrainians in case of another attack. This will bring us respect, not just from Ukraine but also from countries like the United States, China, and others. The Kyiv Independent: A major topic of the Munich Security Conference last year was &quot;Trump-proofing&quot; Western aid for Ukraine, that is, ensuring support for Ukraine will continue even if Donald Trump is elected. Do you think these efforts were successful? Did they achieve something? Gabrielius Landsbergis: No, I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s like all the exercises before Covid hit, exercises of how we vaccinate thousands of people and how we do this and how we do that, how we contain the pandemic. And then, when the real pandemic hit, nobody was prepared. We had to invent all the rules and start from scratch. So I think it was the same with Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Americans declared about half a year before (February 2022) that the Russians were going to attack. And they said &quot;let&apos;s prepare.&quot; We started preparing. When the Russians attacked, we said, &quot;Oh, okay, so this is what it means.&quot; It&apos;s quite a different reality. I&apos;m not surprised. This is probably the feature of democracy, the way that it functions. We&apos;re very short-term. In most cases, we look at the next election rather than at the next decade. So when somebody says that there is trouble ahead, we&apos;re not that worried about it because we have more troubles right now that we need to take care of. Even in my country, when we have discussions about what we should do if Trump is elected, if he decides to rethink his stance on Europe and other things, it&apos;s a very difficult conversation. And I don&apos;t think that we have prepared. Ukrainian infantry take up Zero positions on the Kupiansk Frontline, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 27, 2024.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Why does the West keep making these mistakes when we look at the past three years of the full-scale invasion? Why hasn&apos;t it learned its lesson? And do you think it&apos;s too late to turn the ship around? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I don&apos;t know. Inside Europe, the problem is that we see problems very differently. There are countries close to Ukraine and Russia that do understand what&apos;s happening. We call them the eastern flank countries. You can add Northern Europe to this group. And then you have a lot of other countries for whom to imagine a Russian attack on Brussels&#x2026; I mean, this will never happen, right? That&apos;s why you have to argue whether you still need 2% of GDP for defense when Poland is spending 4% and Lithuania is spending 3.7%. Estonia, almost 4%. And then you have countries far away from Russia who say that this will never happen, they will never attack us. And this is the division. What we need is leadership. We need somebody who would be willing to risk paying the political price for the solutions needed for Europe. So it&apos;s not a bureaucrat who doesn&apos;t really care, but the person who says: &quot;Okay, if we don&apos;t do this, we are doomed. And if we do this, yes, we might also lose, and I will lose personally, but this is the price I&apos;m willing to pay.&quot; Is it not too late? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too late. When Covid hit, Europe decided to borrow 750 billion euros ($780 billion). Sounds like a lot of money. But after a session of just eight hours, the German parliament took a decision to borrow 250 billion euros ($260 billion). Yes, it&apos;s one of the biggest economies in the world. But imagine if it&apos;s doable for Germany, what can Europe do in eight hours? The Kyiv Independent: For a long time, Ukraine has said membership in NATO is the only effective security guarantee. But this seems now increasingly unlikely in the light of recent statements from the U.S. What would you consider the most feasible and effective security guarantee for Ukraine? Gabrielius Landsbergis: I still insist that NATO is the most effective (security guarantee) because you have the United States in it. You have a clear commitment to fight alongside (allies) because it&apos;s at the core of the (NATO founding agreement) Washington Treaty. And even in theory, NATO works as a deterrent, because there&apos;s enough ambiguity in the way that NATO is structured, that you don&apos;t want to test it. The Russians might one day be brave enough to test it, but not yet. So if NATO guarantees would be provided now, I think that Ukraine would be safer immediately. If that is completely off the table, we need U.S. security guarantees that would be second-tier. Basically, the U.S. would fight alongside its allies, who would be willing to join the group and Ukraine in case there&apos;s another attack. If that doesn&apos;t work, well, then it&apos;s the Europeans. The question is whether that would be possible. If that doesn&apos;t happen, then we&apos;re in a very dangerous scenario where Ukraine is actually left alone to fight off anything that might come its way. This would be very similar to the Minsk agreements. A ceasefire, no security guarantees, and just a preparation for the next phase. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

Vance says Zelensky 'badmouthing' Trump, calls it counterproductive	U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 19, saying his public remarks about U.S. President Donald Trump were counterproductive. &quot;The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president&apos;s mind by badmouthing him in public media &#x2014; everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,&quot; Vance told DailyMail. His comments come after Zelensky dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, saying the U.S. president had been misled by Russian disinformation. Trump made the comment as an argument of why Ukraine should hold elections in the near future. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Vance rejected that assertion, insisting that Trump&apos;s stance on Ukraine was not influenced by Russian narratives. &quot;Donald Trump is well-versed in geopolitics and has held a strong stance on the matter for a long time,&quot; he claimed. He also suggested that Zelensky had received &quot;bad advice&quot; on dealing with the Trump administration and had been told he &quot;could do nothing wrong&quot; for the past three years. &quot;We obviously love the Ukrainian people. We admire the bravery of the soldiers, but we obviously think that this war needs to come to a rapid close,&quot; Vance added. This follows Trump&apos;s latest criticism of Zelensky, where he labeled the Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a Truth Social post, accusing him of refusing to hold elections. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine should hold new elections, implying that Zelensky&apos;s leadership was a factor in prolonging the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-says-zelensky-badmouthing-trump-calls-it-counterproductive/	2025-02-19T11:05:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
Lithuania's president unveils 6-point plan to support Ukraine, strengthen European security	Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda outlined a six-point action plan on Feb. 19 to support Ukraine and bolster European security as the U.S. sidelines Europe in talks with Russia to end the war, and concerns grow that negotiations could lead to a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. &quot;We must act now to support Ukraine and boost Europe&apos;s security. No more talk shops &#x2014; time for action,&quot; Nauseda wrote on X. His proposal includes security guarantees for Ukraine, emphasizing that &quot;NATO membership should remain on the table.&quot; He also called for immediate funding for arms and a 10-billion-euro ($10.4 billion) investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Nauseda stressed that Russia must be held accountable for war crimes, and sanctions should remain in place until its aggression ends, frozen assets are seized, and tariffs on Russian and Belarusian imports are implemented. Over $300 billion of Russian central bank reserves remain frozen in Europe, including 191 billion euros ($198 billion) held in the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The Lithuanian president also proposed accelerating Ukraine&apos;s EU accession, setting 2030 as the target date. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s security is part of European security,&quot; he wrote. Neither Ukraine nor Europe was invited to talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The move has set off alarm bells that the U.S. and Russia could reach an agreement on the war without Ukraine or Europe&apos;s involvement, and one that would put their future security in jeopardy. The future of U.S. assistance for Ukraine under President Donald Trump&apos;s administration is also uncertain. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 12 also suggested that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership is not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of ongoing negotiations and that Ukraine may not be able to fully restore its 2014 borders. Ukraine has maintained that firm security guarantees &#x2014; including NATO membership &#x2014; are necessary to prevent Russia from rebuilding its military and potentially launching a new invasion if hostilities were to pause. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; security guarantee and a geopolitical victory for U.S. President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-nauseda-unveils-six-point-plan-to-support-ukraine-strengthen-european-security/	2025-02-19T10:28:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2160823562.jpg
North Korean troops in Russia reportedly told they're fighting South Korean forces	North Korean security services are telling their troops stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast that they are fighting against both the Ukrainian and South Korean militaries, South Korean newspaper Chosun Daily reported, citing captured North Korean soldiers. Two North Korean prisoners of war, captured by Ukrainian forces last month, spoke exclusively to Chosun Daily at a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Ukraine. One of the captives admitted that he and his fellow soldiers believed they were fighting South Korean troops, which heightened their morale and aggression. Each battalion, consisting of about 500 soldiers, was monitored by one or two officers from North Korea&apos;s State Security Ministry, one of the prisoners said. These officers oversaw ideological training and discipline. They reportedly informed their soldiers that Ukrainian drone operators were South Korean military personnel. Seoul has not provided military aid to Kyiv since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. Their journey to Russia took several months, with a group of 2,500 North Koreans departing on Oct. 10, 2024, traveling by train, then by plane, and finally by bus to Kursk, where they arrived in mid-December, according to one of the captives. The other captured soldier, a sniper trained for reconnaissance, said contact between North Korean troops and Russian forces was minimal, with interaction mainly occurring at the command level for ammunition, supplies, and equipment. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 initially seized 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area due to Russian counterattacks, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a renewed offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-in-russia-reportedly-told-theyre-fighting-south-korean-ukrainian-forces/	2025-02-19T10:04:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Trump calls Zelensky 'dictator,' warns of Ukraine's demise without elections	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden &apos;like a fiddle,&apos;&quot; Trump wrote. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Trump also called the Ukrainian president &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; The claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Trump also referred to Zelensky as a &quot;modestly successful comedian&quot; and accused him of persuading the U.S. to spend $350 billion on Ukraine. &quot;The United States has spent 200 billion dollars more than Europe, and Europe&apos;s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back,&quot; Trump claimed. Earlier on Feb. 19, Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s wartime military costs had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU combined providing $200 billion of that sum in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his Feb. 18 statement that Ukraine &quot;should hold new elections,&quot; appearing to blame Zelensky&apos;s leadership for the ongoing war. His comments come amid growing concerns in Kyiv after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia &#x2014; without Ukraine &#x2014; to discuss strategies for ending the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-zelensky-dictator-warns-of-ukraines-demise-without-elections/	2025-02-19T08:39:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine refutes Putin's claims of Russian offensive from Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s General Staff refuted claims by President Vladimir Putin that Russian troops had launched an offensive into Ukraine from Kursk Oblast, spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovyi said on Feb. 19. Putin told Russian media on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, a claim Lykhovyi has dismissed as part of a disinformation campaign. &quot;Since the beginning of the day, 12 combat engagements have been recorded in Kursk Oblast, three of which are still ongoing, while the rest have been repelled,&quot; Lykhovyi said. During one of the attacks, Russian troops attempted to advance toward Ukraine&apos;s state border, according to Lykhovyi. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast as of Feb. 19, 2025, with captured areas marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMap)Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half of that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. Another 909 have been taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-refutes-putins-claims-of-russian-offensive-from-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-19T08:22:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
Putin would 'gladly' meet Trump, says war in Ukraine should be 'worked out' in advance	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 19 that he had been briefed on the outcome of U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, expressing willingness to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ve been reported. I rate them highly. There is a result,&quot; Putin told Russian media. He added that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump but stressed that such a meeting must be carefully prepared. Putin emphasized that he seeks more than just a symbolic meeting, saying key issues, particularly the war in Ukraine, must be &quot;worked out&quot; in advance. The Russian president also confirmed that Trump had told him Ukraine would be included in any negotiation process. &quot;President Trump told me during a telephone conversation, I can confirm that, of course, the United States assumes that the negotiation process will take place with the participation of Russia and Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin&apos;s remarks come after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a delegation to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials. The meeting marked the first face-to-face negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. In response to the talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia, expressing concerns over Ukraine&apos;s exclusion. While no concrete decisions were announced, the U.S.-Russia meeting has raised alarms in Kyiv and Europe, where officials worry about being sidelined in the negotiation process.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-gladly-open-to-meeting-trump-says-war-in-ukraine-to-be-worked-out-in-advance/	2025-02-19T07:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Czechia, Poland preparing decision on status of Ukrainians with temporary protection after ceasefire, war's end	Czechia and the Polish presidency of the EU Council are developing a decision on the status of Ukrainians under temporary protection after a ceasefire is declared or the war ends, Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told Czech news website Novinky on Feb. 18. The EU implemented the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU Council extended temporary protection in June 2024 until March 2026 for over 4 million Ukrainian refugees. Prague and Warsaw are seeking to prepare a &quot;rough version of the proposal,&quot; as the decision should be made later at the EU level, Rakusan said. In the event of a ceasefire or the end of the war in Ukraine, the Czechia will automatically stop granting temporary status to Ukrainians, but they will still be able to stay in the country for a certain period, a year or a year and a half, according to Rakusan. To continue staying in the country, Ukrainians must re-register under a different status, just like other foreigners, he added. The EU also plans to create special centers for Ukrainians to mediate their return to their homes. According to the minister, discussions have already occurred in Germany, Poland, and Austria. Such a center will also be established in the . &quot;(The centers) would offer work in Ukraine, accommodation, life prospects and conditions under which people would return. At the same time, they would also help Ukrainians who decide to stay here by organizing their relocation to another country,&quot; Rakusan added. Czechia is one of the three European countries with the largest number of Ukrainian refugees. According to the European Commission, as of December 2024, the country has hosted about 390,000 Ukrainians who fled due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-poland-preparing-decision-on-status-of-ukrainians-with-temporary-protection-after-ceasefire-wars-end/	2025-02-19T07:18:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1620826063.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump wants Ukraine's natural resources, and more	The following is the Feb. 18, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. It all seemed to be going swimmingly at first. President Volodymyr Zelensky had wooed Republicans and U.S. President Donald Trump with a sweet deal on Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;critical minerals.&#x201D; Trump seemed to take the bait, telling the world he was going to make a deal with Ukraine on its &#x201C;rare earths and other things&#x201D; in exchange for support. Then Trump comes out saying that actually, he would like the U.S. to be paid back for the $350 billion that it had given Ukraine for its war effort &#x2014; a number that doesn&#x2019;t correspond to reality. U.S. assistance to Ukraine since the start of the invasion is somewhere around $100 billion, much of which has gone to paying back the U.S. for weapons it&#x2019;s sent to Ukraine. Trump also claimed at that time that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. &quot;I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that,&quot; the U.S. president said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 10. To the public, the deal seemed to be quickly turning into Ukraine &#x2014; the country that was invaded &#x2014; being asked to pay reparations to an ally. The floodgates seemed to break open when U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent showed up in Kyiv with a one-page memorandum of understanding-style document with the terms of the deal the U.S. was proposing. While the contents of the deal weren&#x2019;t revealed to the public, what we did find out pretty quickly was that Bessent asked Zelensky to sign on the spot, but the Ukrainian president refused, wanting more time to review the deal, and namely, because the document made no mention of any security guarantees in exchange for Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Over the following days, reports surfaced with the details of the proposed deal. Here&#x2019;s what we know: The Trump administration is reportedly seeking a 50% interest in all of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources &#x2014; not just critical minerals, but valuable natural resources like oil and gas, as well potentially stakes in port and other critical infrastructure, through the creation of a joint investment fund. The deal would give the U.S. half of Ukraine&#x2019;s earnings from resource extraction and the sale of new licenses, as well as priority in purchasing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral exports, the New York Times and other outlets reported, citing Ukrainian and European officials. The Telegraph got a hold of a copy of the memorandum, reporting that it said explicitly that the proposed deal covers the &#x201C;economic value associated with resources of Ukraine,&#x201D; including &#x201C;mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports, other infrastructure (as agreed).&#x201D; Current and former senior Ukrainian officials have expressed serious concern about the deal, with one calling it &#x201C;colonial&#x201D; in comments to AP, and saying that Zelensky should not sign it. They see it as audacious that the U.S. would seriously come and ask Ukraine to give up so much when it is the victim of this war. One area that seems to have irked officials the most, according to sources, is the oil and gas part of the proposed deal. Underdeveloped critical mineral deposits &#x2014; fine, but gaining a stake in the country&#x2019;s massive oil and gas sector? Not so fast. Oil and gas giant Naftogaz is one of the country&#x2019;s largest companies and taxpayers, making a profit of over $500 million in the first nine months of 2024. Zelensky and his team have reportedly come up with a counterproposal, but it&#x2019;s unclear yet where that counteroffer stands. One thing to keep in mind, as some of my interlocutors have mentioned, is that the deal presented by Bessent is just the first offer. And to remember that this is all pretty par for the course with Trump, who likes to swing for the fences in negotiations to get the most out of them. The two sides will keep hashing it out, likely to meet somewhere in the middle, they say. It&#x2019;s not just about what the two sides want, either. Ironing out the details of a deal like this will not happen overnight. For one, Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources belong to the Ukrainian people, per the country&#x2019;s constitution &#x2014; no one president can just hand them over without parliament ratifying some sort of agreement. It&#x2019;s also unclear what jurisdiction will govern any future potential joint ventures. The document passed along by Bessent proposes that the deal be &#x201C;governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,&#x201D; as the Telegraph revealed. People aren&#x2019;t totally sure about why New York was chosen, and think that&#x2019;s just another layer to this that still needs to be sorted out. But some in the business world don&#x2019;t see the possibility of a deal to create joint ventures in such dire terms. Many of them welcome the idea of American know-how, expertise, and management entering into business with Ukrainian companies &#x2014; some of which, especially the state-owned ones, have languished for years, underdeveloped and poorly-managed, or in some unfortunate cases, owned by shady oligarchs, and breeding grounds for corruption. Stay tuned, as there&#x2019;s sure to be more. Collage of Ukrainian drones. (Lisa Litvinenko/The Kyiv Independent)Defense tech &#x2014; Changing tidesUkrainian weapons startups are finally seeing an inflow of funds from Western investors who have long been intrigued by Ukraine&apos;s defense tech sector but have so far kept their money out of the war-torn country, defense industry reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. Financial analysis firm Pitchbook provided the Kyiv Independent with data showing a four-fold rise in foreign venture capital deals in Ukraine-headquartered startups after the market flatlined in 2022 and 2023 following Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The total dollar value remains slim &#x2014; just under $20 million by Pitchbook&#x2019;s accounting, and $40 million according to the Ukrainian government. But with most of these new deals coming in at the end of 2024, a dam may be bursting. Western investors have until now been hesitant to hand money over to these Ukrainian firms. But pressure on Europe to expand its military muscle might be changing that. &#x201C;We are getting more and more interest all the time,&#x201D; says Deborah Fairlamb, who runs a U.S.-registered but Ukraine-focused fund, Green Flag VC. &#x201C;There&apos;s been tons of inquiries from governments all over the place.&#x201D; Read the full article here. And in case you missed it &#x2014; Post has also assembled a list of 10 Ukrainian drone makers, producing unmanned aerial vehicles ranging from mass-produced first-person view (FPV) drones to highly secretive deep-strike UAVs that we believe to be the biggest game in town. Check it out here. Ukraine&#x2019;s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) has detained the director of popular online casino Pin-Up over its alleged Russian ownership and business in Russia, the agency announced in a press release on Feb. 14. An ongoing investigation into the company earlier found that its real owners were Russian citizens. The owners allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of Pin-Up&#x2019;s users, including Ukrainian military personnel. Quantum Systems, a German drone manufacturer operating two plants in Ukraine, plans to double its drone production in the country, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Ministry announced on Feb. 14. The company last year promised to supply Kyiv with 500 reconnaissance drones by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, Ukraine is set to receive 6,000 AI-powered HX-2 attack drones from the Munich-based defense technology firm Helsing. The HX-2, an electrically propelled precision munition with a range of up to 100 kilometers, is equipped with onboard artificial intelligence, ensuring resilience against electronic warfare. The European Business Association (EBA) urged the Ukrainian government to declassify its information on mineral deposit data in a statement published on Feb. 13. The association argued that current restrictions hinder international agreements and discourage investment. Currently, information on resources such as gold, lithium, titanium, and platinum is classified as secret or &quot;for official use,&quot; limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to engage with global partners. Agricultural trade between Ukraine and the EU reached $17 billion in 2024, exceeding the previous record of $16.5 billion in 2022 by 3%, the Kyiv-based research Institute of Agrarian Economics (IAE) reported. The trade volume is the highest since the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was signed in 2014, said Mykola Puhachov, deputy director of IAE. Agricultural expert Oleg Nivievskyi told the Kyiv Independent that exports likely increased due to rising prices. European countries have found themselves at &quot;a separate kids&apos; table&quot; in the negotiations on Ukraine because of insufficient investment in their defense, Armin Papperger, chief executive of Rheinmetall, said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 18. &quot;If you don&apos;t invest, if you&apos;re not strong, they handle you like kids,&quot; Papperger said, adding that over the past 30 years, Europe has considered it acceptable to invest about 1% of GDP in defense. &quot;If parents have dinner, the kids have to sit at another table,&quot; he said. &quot;The U.S. is negotiating with Russia, and no European is at the table &#x2014; it has become very clear that the Europeans are the kids.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-trump-wants-ukraines-natural-resources-and-more/	2025-02-19T07:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--18-.jpg
Hungary again blocks EU sanctions against Moscow Patriarch Kirill	Hungary negotiated exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and domestic use of Russian oil products during talks on the EU&apos;s 16th package of sanctions, a Hungarian government spokesperson said on Feb. 19. The statement came after EU ambassadors agreed on the next package of sanctions imposed against Russia, targeting aluminum trade and Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. &quot;These exemptions allow MOL to use refined Russian oil products domestically, remove maintenance equipment for the Druzhba pipeline from sanctions, and ensure Budapest&#x2019;s metro system can continue receiving necessary servicing and repairs,&quot; spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said on X. &quot;Hungary also blocked sanctions against 27 individuals and organizations, including Patriarch Kirill, arguing that targeting religious leaders undermines peace efforts,&quot; Kovacs said. This marks yet another instance of Budapest blocking sanctions measures against the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill (secular name Vladimir Gundyayev) has publicly supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and is regarded as a close ally of the Kremlin. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly leader in the EU, has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine. &quot;The era of sanctions is over. A new reality is emerging, with promising U.S.-Russia negotiations,&quot; Kovacs said in an apparent reference to a shift in U.S.-Russian relations under U.S. President Donald Trump. Initially threatening Moscow with additional tariffs and sanctions unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiate, Trump has since then adopted more positive rhetoric toward Russia while blaming Ukraine for the war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, signaled that the settlement of the war would include the lifting of sanctions. EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis commented that Brussels must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-says-it-negotiated-exemptions-for-patriarch-kirill/	2025-02-19T05:58:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
Russia offering US deal on natural resources, access to Arctic	Russia is offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 18, citing Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent Saudi Arabia talks. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Feb. 18 with a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian and the U.S. delegates in Riyadh also discussed economic cooperation, including global energy prices. Moscow is suggesting that American oil companies may return to the country and is interested in joint projects with the U.S. in the Arctic, Dmitriev said before the talks started. The statement comes as Kyiv announced it is not ready to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. President Volodymyr Zelensky commented that Ukraine is open to investment but argued that the memorandum, presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12, needs more work as it does not include any concrete security guarantees. &quot;We believe that at some point, they (American companies) will come back because why would they start giving up the opportunity to access Russian natural resources that Russia gave them?&quot; Dmitriev said, adding that large American oil companies had &quot;very successful businesses&quot; in Russia. &quot;We should also do joint projects, including, for example, in the Arctic and other areas. Joint projects will allow us to be more successful,&quot; Dmitriev added. U.S. companies allegedly lost $300 billion from sanctions against Russia, and Joe Biden&apos;s administration &quot;gave a lot of wrong messages&quot; about the state of the Russian economy, Dmitriev claimed. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only one major U.S. company, Exxon Mobil, was producing oil in Russia. The company also owns 30% of the Sakhalin 1 oil project. Following the imposition of sanctions against Sakhalin 1, Exxon Mobil tried to sell its stake but failed, according to The Moscow Times. After the outbreak of the all-out war, the leading American oilfield service companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, also announced their withdrawal from Russia. Russia is also expecting the U.S. to unfreeze Russian state assets, including those owned by the Central Bank, which were previously invested in American ones. The assets are valued at about $6 billion, the outlet reported. Altogether, nearly $300 billion of the Central Bank&apos;s foreign exchange reserves have been frozen, of which over $200 billion are in Europe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly assured European allies that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Moscow at least until an agreement is reached to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Yet, following talks between the U.S. and Russian delegations, Rubio suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-offers-us-deal-on-its-natural-resources-access-to-arctic/	2025-02-19T05:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
US helping Putin escape isolation, Zelensky says after Riyadh talks	The U.S. helped Russian President Vladimir Putin to escape years of isolation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 19 in reference to recent U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met on Feb. 18 with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and Putin&apos;s top aide, Yuri Ushakov, to discuss an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. The talks, which excluded Ukrainian representatives, marked the highest-level meeting between the U.S. and Russia since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;The fact that they are discussing bilateral issues in Saudi Arabia is their right, but I believe that the U.S. helped Putin escape many years of isolation,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference, adding that Ukraine is nevertheless &quot;ready for anything.&quot; Though the talks in Saudi Arabia concluded without specific decisions on ending the war, U.S. and Russian officials said the meeting was constructive and laid the ground for further discussion. Trump also voiced his intent to meet with Putin in person, &quot;probably&quot; by the end of February. While Trump&apos;s predecessor, U.S. Joe Biden, has not met the Russian leader since the outbreak of the full-scale war, two European leaders &#x2013; Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban &#x2013; separately met Putin in Moscow last year. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step rather than official negotiations and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began. Speaking at the press conference, Zelensky also referred to the Trump administration&apos;s supposed claims that &quot;90% of aid comes from the U.S.&quot; &quot;We understand that the truth is a little different, although we are certainly grateful for the assistance. I would like there to be more truth in Trump&apos;s team,&quot; he added. Ukraine&apos;s head of state refused claims that Washington has provided Kyiv with $500 billion in assistance since 2022, putting the figure at nearly $100 billion in military and financial support. &quot;I think that Putin and the Russians are very happy because issues are being discussed with them. Yesterday, there were signals that they were being regarded as victims. That is something new,&quot; Zelensky noted. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He also falsely claimed that Zelensky has an approval rating of 4% and urged Ukraine to hold elections, a step not permitted by the country&apos;s constitution during a war. A survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19 put Zelensky&apos;s approval rating at 57% as of February. According to the latest poll from Reuters published Feb. 19, Trump&#x2019;s own approval rating currently stands at 44%.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-helping-putin-out-of-isolation-zelensky-says-after/	2025-02-19T05:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199687527.jpg
US promises Europe to maintain Russia sanctions at least until Ukraine peace deal, Bloomberg reports	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured European allies that the U.S. would maintain sanctions against Moscow at least until an agreement is reached to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 19, citing its undisclosed sources. In the nearly three years since the full-scale invasion, the U.S. has implemented several rounds of sanctions on Russia to undermine its efforts to continue its war in Ukraine. Restrictions have been imposed on banks, the gas and oil industries, and the delivery of dual-use goods, among other spheres. Following talks between the U.S. and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Rubio suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot; Rubio added that the EU would &quot;have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.&quot; According to Bloomberg, Rubio subsequently assured European colleagues in a phone call that the sanctions would not be lifted at least until a settlement could be reached. The State Department&apos;s readout on Rubio&apos;s call with European allies does not mention any sanctions but says that the countries &quot;agreed to remain in close contact&quot; as they work to achieve &quot;a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine.&quot; The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-keep-sanctions-against-russia-until-deal-to-end-war-reached-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-19T04:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199666749.jpg
War has cost Ukraine $320 billion in weapons, US and EU provided two-thirds, Zelensky says	Ukraine&apos;s wartime military costs have amounted to $320 billion, with the U.S. and the EU providing $200 billion of that sum in defense support, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 19. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms, this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv. The comments came following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim that Kyiv has &quot;essentially&quot; agreed to a deal on $500 billion in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources in exchange for Washington&apos;s support. Trump has also repeatedly made unsubstantiated and contradicting claims about the value of assistance the U.S. has provided to Ukraine since 2022, most recently putting the figure at $350 billion. &quot;In total, the U.S. separately gave us about $67 billion in weapons, and we received $31.5 billion in budget support,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine is grateful for the provided support. &quot;But one cannot count up to $500 billion and say, &apos;give us back $500 billion in minerals,&apos; that&apos;s not a serious discussion.&quot; Zelensky reiterated that Ukraine is ready to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal on natural resources as long as Kyiv provides security guarantees. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky on Feb. 12, but Ukraine refused to sign unless the document included clear security commitments.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-has-cost-320-billion-us-and-eu-covered-two-thirds-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T03:31:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
Ukraine doesn't want to become 'center for extraction of raw materials,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is open to investment but does not want to become a &quot;center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with CNN Turk published on Feb. 19. The comment comes after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky on Feb. 12. The president said Ukraine is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. &quot;Ukraine is ready for investment, provided that the occupied territories are liberated and natural resources are protected,&quot; Zelensky told CNN Turk. &quot;We do not want to become a center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent. It is more important for us to be friends and partners, not just a source of raw materials,&quot; he added. A Ukrainian delegation led by Zelensky discussed the deal with U.S. delegates led by Vice President JD Vance during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Kyiv praised the talks as constructive, even though they did not result in the signing of the memorandum. &quot;Without security guarantees, the deal will not be fair. If we want to give something, we must get something in return,&quot; Zelensky said. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, undisclosed American officials told the outlet. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-doesnt-want-to-become-center-for-extraction-of-raw-materials-for-any-continent-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T03:06:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Russia behind Trump's false claim of 4% approval rating, Zelensky says	Ukraine understands that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s false claim that President Volodymyr Zelensky holds a 4% approval rating comes from Russia, Zelensky said during a press conference on Feb. 19. &quot;We saw this disinformation. We understand it comes from Russia. We understand, and we have evidence that those figures have been discussed between the U.S. and Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump made the claim on Feb. 18 without providing evidence, presenting it as an argument that Ukraine should hold elections soon. Speaking the same day when a U.S. delegation met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine&apos;s participation, Trump also laid the blame for the war on Kyiv. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. The false allegation ignores the fact that the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. While voicing his respect for Trump and the American people, Zelensky said that the U.S. president &quot;sadly lives in this disinformation space.&quot; Zelensky also pointed to the latest survey that put the president&apos;s approval rating at 57%, adding that efforts to replace him at this moment would not be successful.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-disinformation-behind-trumps-claim-of-4-approval-rating-zelensky-says/	2025-02-19T02:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850432035.jpg

Zelensky's trust rating increases to 57%, survey shows, contradicting Trump's claims	Around 57% of Ukrainians trust President Volodymyr Zelensky as of February, marking an increase of five percentage points since December, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19. The poll, carried out between Feb. 4 and 9, was published shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump alleged that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating&quot; without providing a source to back his claim. The latest survey shows that Zelensky continues to enjoy support from the majority of Ukrainians, even marking a slight increase in trust after a year of steady decline in popularity throughout 2024. Around 37% of respondents said they do not trust the president, a two-point drop since December. &quot;If some international partners and allies are worried about the legitimacy of the President in the context of possible peace negotiations and consider it appropriate to insist on elections, then from the point of view of Ukrainian citizens themselves, there are no problems with this,&quot; said Anton Hrushetskyi, the executive director of KIIS. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. The false allegation ignores the fact that the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. Pushing to broker a quick peace deal, Trump has begun pressuring Ukraine to hold elections while blaming Zelensky&apos;s administration for the continuation of the war. &quot;That&apos;s not a Russia thing. That&apos;s something coming from me,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 18 about the need to hold elections in Ukraine, claiming that his views were not influenced by Moscow&apos;s narratives. The KIIS survey was conducted by phone, with the participation of 1,000 respondents living in Ukraine-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-trust-in-zelensky-increases-to-57-survey-shows/	2025-02-19T02:22:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06351------.jpg
Trump to 'probably' meet Putin before end of February	U.S. President Donald Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin before the end of February, CNN reported on Feb. 19. Since the first days after his return to the White House, Trump has been voicing his intent to meet with Putin to discuss how to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine as soon as possible. Answering a journalist&apos;s questions at a press conference in Mar-a-Lago about whether the meeting would take place before the end of the month, Trump said &quot;probably&quot; without mentioning a specific date. Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call for nearly 90 minutes on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with President Volodymyr Zelensky soon after. The U.S. president has vowed to quickly end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine after taking office. Later, Trump announced that his first meeting with Putin would take place in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. On Feb. 18, a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Saudia Arabia, marking the first direct negotiations between the two countries since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Trump also previously said he would meet with Zelensky in Washington, but the U.S. or Ukraine have not confirmed any specific plans.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-probably-meet-putin-before-end-of-february/	2025-02-19T01:57:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1152460187.jpg
Slavoj Žižek: Fate no longer smiles on us, Europeans	The second line of the Ukrainian national anthem &#x2014; &#x201C;Fate/luck still smiles on us, fellow Ukrainians&#x201D; &#x2014; sadly no longer holds. Much worse, we should extend this retreat of luck to Europe itself: Fate/luck no longer smiles on us, fellow Europeans. The situation is now so serious that the same old points should be repeated again and again&#x2014;perhaps they will find more resonance today now that the crisis has broken out openly. To anyone who follows our media, it is more than obvious how U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s new administration has thrown our time out of joint in both domestic and foreign policy. But why should Europe be the one chosen to set the time straight? The reason is not just that it seems to be the big loser of Trump&#x2019;s new global politics. Some of us still remember the famous opening of &#x201C;The Communist Manifesto&#x201D;: &#x201C;A specter is haunting Europe &#x2014; the specter of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies...&#x201D; Could we not use the same words to characterize the status of &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; in today&#x2019;s public perception? A specter is haunting the world &#x2014; the specter of Eurocentrism. All the powers of old Europe and of the new world order have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Nigel Farage and Russian President Vladimir Putin, AfD and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n, pro-immigrant anti-racists and protectors of traditional European values, Latin American leftists and Arab conservatives, West Bank Zionists and Chinese &#x201C;patriotic&#x201D; communists&#x2026; There is a profound similarity between Trump&#x2019;s attacks on the triad of environmentalism, political correctness, and LGBT+ rights and the conflict between Russia and Europe. One should ask a simple question: Which civilization today fully embodies the triad attacked by Trump? Only one: European civilization, as the latest form of Enlightenment. In an interview on July 15, 2018, just after a stormy meeting with EU leaders, Trump mentioned the European Union as the first in the line of &#x201C;foes&#x201D; of the U.S., ahead of Russia and China. What Trump tries to do is dissolve European unity, and his efforts are finding an echo in more and more European states (Hungary, Germany, Austria, the U.K.). During the Munich Security Conference, the first act of U.S. Vice President JD Vance was to launch a brutal ideological assault on Europe, accusing its leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration, and running in fear from voters&#x2019; true beliefs. He openly questioned whether current European values warranted defense by the U.S. &#x201C;Europe&#x201D; today is a terrain of ideological and political struggle. Many ideas of Europe compete and exist in a kind of superposition: the conservative notion of Europe as a space of Christian sovereign states, the technocratic vision of Europe as an economic unity, and more. So which Europe bothers Trump as well as European populists? It is the Europe of transnational unity, the Europe vaguely aware that, to cope with the challenges of our moment, we must move beyond the constraints of nation-states. It is the Europe that also desperately strives to remain faithful to the old Enlightenment motto of solidarity with victims, the Europe aware that humanity is now one &#x2014; that we are all on the same boat (or, as we say, on the same Spaceship Earth), so that others&#x2019; misery is also our problem. This brings us to the scandalous performance called the Munich Security Conference. Timothy Garton Ash raised the question apropos of the Munich conference: &#x201C;Will the peace be like Chamberlain&#x2019;s peace for our time?&#x201D; My answer is that it could turn out to be even worse because our time is a new time of BRICS multipolarity. Both prospects of peace in which Trump&#x2019;s administration is now engaged &#x2014; Gaza and Ukraine &#x2014; are exemplary cases of how the BRICS world that is now emerging will function. Yes, it will be multipolar, but in the sense of a few strong states each defining its own sphere of influence and limiting the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors. Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy fully fits the BRICS world: He admits Ukraine is in Russia&#x2019;s sphere of influence while insisting that Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and Panama are in the U.S. sphere of influence. That&#x2019;s why he immediately engaged in negotiations with Putin, openly excluding Europe from peace talks. Even when Trump and Putin disagree on many things, they already speak the same language. No wonder Trump also said that Russia should rejoin the G7, signaling a general re-normalization of Russia. So it is not just that Europe should unite to become one more big power within the BRICS space; it should become an exception, a place that offers support to the victims of the new BRICS superpowers, each of which defines its own sphere of influence. The announced U.S. takeover of Gaza demonstrates what happens within a superpower&#x2019;s sphere of influence: To put it bluntly, you do what you want, dropping all pretense. When Trump announced his plan to take over Gaza, we found ourselves back at the two-state solution rejected by Israel, only with one minor detail changed: The two states are not Israel and Palestine but Israel and the United States. So what will happen if Trump succeeds and peace prevails in an ethnically cleansed greater Israel? Shakespeare wrote, &#x201C;The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.&#x201D; The horror with Trump is even worse: If his evil deeds succeed, they will be remembered as good, as something that brought peace. The peace plan advocated by the U.S. will leave Ukraine caught between two colonizations. The eastern part will be directly annexed by Russia, while the western part will be turned into a de facto economic colony, with large portions of its fertile land already owned by Western corporations, its natural resources plundered, etc. For Trump, a &#x201C;peace guarantee&#x201D; means guarantees from both sides (Ukraine and Russia) that the U.S. will have free access to Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources to cover the costs of its military aid to Ukraine. So Russia will keep (part of) its cake, and the U.S. will eat (part of) it, with Ukraine left with nothing &#x2014; at best, some symbolic titles. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Feb. 16, 2025. (Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images)So what can Europe do in what former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis describes as &#x201C;Europe&apos;s last chance to seize autonomy from the U.S.?&#x201D; Many things. Regarding Gaza, Europe could go beyond condemning the Trump takeover and simply organize a large relief operation, bringing food, medical equipment, tents, and other necessities by sea and from Egypt. If the U.S., not just Israel, were to block this aid, the already obvious truth would be even harder to ignore. As for Ukraine, Europe must draw the consequences of what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Munich on Feb. 15, 2025: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s be honest. Now we can&#x2019;t rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on an issue that threatens it. Many, many leaders have talked about Europe needing its own military &#x2014; an army of Europe.&#x201D; Ukraine now faces a difficult choice between the U.S. and Europe. Until now, it has been able to rely on both, but the crack is now wide open. The U.S. message is clear: negotiations will begin between Washington and Moscow, with Kyiv joining later &#x2014; its role reduced to signing whatever the two major powers decide. The implicit threat? If Kyiv refuses, it will be left to fend for itself &#x2014; alongside Europe, which is conspicuously excluded from the talks, despite the war unfolding on its soil. Statements by U.S. Vice President JD Vance against Europe make it clear that the real target of the U.S.&#x2019; shift on Ukraine is not Ukraine itself but Europe &#x2014; specifically, its emancipatory legacy. The question that lingers behind all this is: Will Putin take the negotiations seriously at all, or are they just another step in Russia&#x2019;s continuous expansion? The answer is not buried deep in Russia&#x2019;s soul &#x2014; it depends largely on how others respond to Russian politics. So, again, what should and could Europe do to assert itself as an autonomous power? First, Europe must clearly (re)define itself &#x2014; and here, problems already arise, with states and populist forces opposing both a united Europe and its emancipatory legacy. Second, part of this redefinition is military autonomy. John Bolton predicts that Trump will withdraw the U.S. from NATO &#x2014; let&#x2019;s hope this happens and NATO becomes the armed force of a united Europe. Third, Europe will have to rethink its economic policy toward greater coordination and&#x2014;to use the prohibited word&#x2014;planning. Large-scale, obligatory planning, not just vague &#x201C;coordination&#x201D; or &#x201C;collaboration,&#x201D; is the only way to confront the crises threatening our very survival. Planning in times of multiple crises must combine features that may appear mutually exclusive: while outcomes cannot be fully predicted, let alone planned, this very unpredictability demands rigorous preparation. In short, even though crises cannot be planned, they require a great deal of planning. After carefully outlining competing tendencies, we must act with full awareness that unexpected consequences may force us to shift course. Does this sound utopian? Absolutely not &#x2014; just look at some of the world&#x2019;s most successful economies, where the state plays a central role in regulating and directing economic activity, from Switzerland and Singapore to South Korea. In other words, the stance Europe should adopt today is one of principled pragmatism. Groucho Marx once said, &#x201C;These are my principles, and if you don&#x2019;t like them&#x2026; well, I have others.&#x201D; This is the formula of unprincipled pragmatism &#x2014; when those in power change their principles merely to stay in power. In the ongoing negotiations about peace in Ukraine, Trump presents himself as a pragmatic realist, urging all sides to choose the lesser evil. But as none other than Jerry Garcia put it, &#x201C;Constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil.&#x201D; On the other hand, there is the dogmatic advocacy of principles &#x2014; sticking to them even at the cost of economic and social disruption. Principled pragmatism does not seek a middle ground between these two extremes; it means something much more precise: when circumstances change radically, we must adjust many of our particular positions precisely to remain faithful to our core principles. For Europe, the principle at stake is unconditional fidelity to the Enlightenment legacy, while the pragmatic aspect involves navigating unpredictable and difficult decisions. Europe is clearly no longer treated as the U.S.&#x2019;s primary ally, so one option to consider is a strategic alliance with China against the emerging axis of the U.S., Russia, and India. Although China is closer to Russia in the war against Ukraine, it has sent clear signals that it does not fully support Russia&#x2019;s aggressive politics. Europe should seize this crisis as an opportunity to reassert itself and regain strength. French President Emmanuel Macron was right to convene an urgent summit of European leaders in Paris, but the real question is how far this group can and will go. Will it be just another declaration &#x2014; an excuse to do nothing? In recent decades, Europe has been full of such declarations. So my conclusion is not cautiously optimistic but pessimistic &#x2014; with a hope that miracles can still happen. The battle is almost lost, but not yet fully lost. We constantly hear that Europe is lagging behind the U.S. and China in digitalization and AI. However, sometimes being late is an advantage: it allows us to watch others make inevitable mistakes and enter the process in a more informed way. It is here that we should recall Nietzsche&#x2019;s maxim: &#x201C;What doesn&#x2019;t kill me makes me stronger.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-fate-no-longer-smiles-on-us-europeans/	2025-02-19T01:31:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
EU ambassadors reportedly agree on 16th package of Russia sanctions	EU ambassadors agreed on a new package of sanctions against Russia, targeting aluminum imports and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, Euronews reported on Feb. 19. The measures will be formally adopted on Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the outlet reported. The EU has already adopted sanctions against some Russian aluminum products, with the latest measures also targeting primary aluminum. Russia represents around 6% of the EU&apos;s imports of the metal. The &quot;shadow fleet&quot; denotes a flotilla of aging and poorly insured ships Russia uses to avoid sanctions on the oil trade. The West believes the vessels are used for other illicit activities, including espionage and sabotage. The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that a settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war would include relief from the economic restrictions imposed on Moscow. A Rubio-led delegation met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and top presidential aide Yuri Ushakov for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level U.S.-Russia meeting since the outbreak of the full-scale war. EU and Ukrainian representatives were not included in the discussion. The U.S. diplomacy chief said that the EU would later take part in the peace process as it is part of the sanctions regime against Russia but assured European partners that the Western sanctions would remain in place until a settlement is reached. EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis commented that Brussels must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ambassadors-reportedly-agree-on-16th-package-of-russia-sanctions/	2025-02-19T00:59:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Russia will try to divide us' — Kallas on US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia	European foreign ministers and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh, Kallas said on X on Feb. 18. A U.S. delegation met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and top presidential aide Yuri Ushakov in Riyadh on Feb. 18 to initiate talks on ending the war, the first official meeting between the two sides since the full-scale invasion began. Ukraine was excluded entirely from the discussions. &quot;Russia will try to divide us. Let&apos;s not walk into their traps. By working together with the U.S., we can achieve a just and lasting peace &#x2014; on Ukraine&apos;s terms,&quot; Kallas wrote on X. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly stressed that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step rather than official negotiations and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-will-try-to-divide-us-kallas-on-us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-19T00:36:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2189729487.jpg

1 killed, 14 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian oblasts over the past day killed at least one civilian and injured at least 14, including two children, regional authorities reported on Feb. 19. Russia launched 167 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight and fired two Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles against Sumy Oblast, the Air Force reported. As of 9 a.m. local time, 106 Russian drones have been shot down over 14 oblasts, while 56 drones were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. A massive drone strike against the energy infrastructure of Odesa and the region injured four people, including a child, and left 160,000 Odesa residents without heating and electricity, according to the authorities. A kindergarten, children&apos;s clinic, and residential buildings were damaged in the attack. The missile strike against Sumy damaged the windows of a non-residential building but inflicted no casualties, the regional military administration reported. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Another civilian was reported injured in Pokrovsk. Seven people, including a child, were injured during Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three apartment buildings and eight houses were reportedly damaged in the strikes. Russia regularly attacks Ukrainian regions with missiles, drones, and other weaponry, inflicting civilian casualties on a daily basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-127/	2025-02-18T23:53:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19_01-29-08.jpg
Reported drone strike against Russian oil refinery in Samara Oblast causes fire	Drones attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on Feb. 19, Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev reported on his Telegram channel. Residents posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery. Sounds of explosions were reported at around 2:45 a.m. local time. The strike reportedly caused a fire at the refinery. There were no casualties, according to Fedorishchev. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The facility &quot;has a processing capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. &quot;Its products include fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen,&quot; Kovalenko said while reporting on the attack. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. In less than two months of 2025, at least 17 Russian oil facilities were attacked by drones, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. On Feb. 17, Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky district of Kuban. The pumping station was taken out of operation due to the strike.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-at-syzran-oil-refinery-in-russias-samara-oblast-causes-fire/	2025-02-18T23:18:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19-09_00_05.jpeg

Russian strike on Odesa injures 4, causes massive power outages	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. A massive Russian drone strike against the southern city of Odesa and Odesa Oblast overnight on Feb. 19 injured at least four people, including a child, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. All the victims have been hospitalized and are in a condition of moderate severity. A children&apos;s clinic, a kindergarten, high-rise buildings, and cars were damaged in the attack, according to Kiper. The strike resulted in massive power outages in the city, with 14 schools, 13 kindergartens, and over 500 houses left without electricity and heating, said Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov. The governor said that emergency power shutdowns are also in effect elsewhere in Odesa Oblast as all relevant services are working to resolve the situation. Odesa, a port city on Ukraine&#x2019;s Black Sea coast with a population of around 1 million, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks throughout the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-odesa/	2025-02-18T22:16:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-19_08-00-19.jpg
Ukraine and Moldova sign cooperation memorandum on EU accession	Ukraine and Moldova have signed a memorandum of cooperation to strengthen their efforts toward European Union integration and accession, Ukraine&#x2019;s government press service reported on Feb. 18. The agreement, signed by Ukraine&#x2019;s Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna and Moldova&#x2019;s Deputy Prime Minister Cristina Gherasimov, aims to enhance collaboration in the accession process. It outlines key areas of cooperation, including EU enlargement negotiations, legal harmonization, judicial reform, and financial support. The memorandum also promotes the exchange of knowledge and experience in democratic governance, economic policies, and the fight against corruption. &#x201C;Despite the times of global turbulence, European integration remains an unchanging goal for our countries, and we are ready to go to it hand in hand,&#x201D; Stephanishyna said. An action plan will be developed to implement these initiatives through joint meetings, training sessions, and working groups. Ukraine received EU membership candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova in November 2023, and the European Council agreed on it a month later. Moldova lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-moldova-sign-cooperation-memorandum-on-eu-accession/	2025-02-18T20:48:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg
Russian Shahed drones more dangerous after modifications, military intelligence reports	Significant modifications have been observed in the Shahed-136 drones that Russia mass produces, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Feb. 18. The Shahed-136 drones, given the name Geran-2 in Russia, now feature a heavier warhead and additional ballast installed in the UAV design. The upgraded Shahed-136 now carries a 90-kilogram warhead, nearly double the explosive capacity of the previous 50-kilogram version. This significantly enhances its destructive capability. However, due to the heavier payload, the drone&#x2019;s range has decreased from 1,350 kilometers (839 miles) to about 650 kilometers (404 miles), limiting its reach but making it deadlier in closer-range attacks. A sticker labeled &#x201C;agricultural equipment parts&#x201D; in English and Chinese, with a 2024 production date, was found on an antenna used in the drones. Russia is increasingly using Chinese-made electronics to replace Western components, including critical circuit chips. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Shahed-type drones are often used for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shahed-drones-more-dangerous-after-modifications-military-intelligence-reports/	2025-02-18T19:10:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Macron rules out sending French troops to Ukraine's frontlines	France will not send its soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a television interview on Feb. 18. Macron invited European leaders to an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 in response to U.S. officials saying Europe will not participate in Ukraine peace talks. France is set to host a second summit on Feb. 19 to continue discussions of security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;France is not preparing to send combat ground troops to the front,&quot; Macron said. In partnership with the British, France is ready to consider sending experts or even a limited number of troops beyond the frontline to demonstrate solidarity and help Ukraine defend itself, Macron said. Supporting NATO membership for Ukraine is among the several ways France is ready to support Ukraine in its battle against Russia&apos;s aggression, Macron added. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaled that his country is prepared to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a European-led peacekeeping force on Feb. 16. U.S. President Donald Trump said he is not opposed to European peacekeepers monitoring a ceasefire in Ukraine on Feb. 18. Macron called for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of a violation by Russia in a potential ceasefire at an emergency summit held in France on Feb. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-rules-out-sending-french-troops-to-ukraines-frontlines/	2025-02-18T17:17:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258320110.jpg
Canada wants to participate in talks on Ukraine's security guarantees, official says	Canada is interested in partaking in conversations about security guarantees for Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said on Feb. 18. &quot;We want to be part of these conversations regarding security guarantees,&quot; Joly told reporters in Brussels on Feb. 18. &quot;We want to be part of conversations linked to more Canadians being involved in protecting Ukraine.&quot; Joly&apos;s comments come a day before Canada is set to join European countries for a high-level summit in Paris, where leaders will discuss security options for Ukraine. The summit comes on the heels of a Feb. 18 meeting between U.S. and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia that did not include Ukraine. Canada is asking the U.S. to keep Ukraine at the table in any talks with Russia, Joly said. The West cannot &quot;let Russia go unchecked,&quot; she said. &quot;Many Canadians have been inspired by what is going on in Ukraine because we know they&apos;re fighting for the right reasons.&quot; The election of U.S. President Donald Trump has disrupted the Western alliance supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Trump has said he expects Europe to replace the U.S. as Kyiv&apos;s chief source of military aid, and that the U.S. will not send troops to Ukraine as part of any future Western peacekeeping force. Canada, home to one of the world&apos;s largest Ukrainian populations, has been a key ally of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ottawa has provided over $3 billion in military assistance to Kyiv, including advanced weaponry, drones, and vehicles.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-is-interested-in-being-part-of-protecting-ukraine-official-says/	2025-02-18T16:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/joly.jpg
Western intelligence shows Putin not ready for 'real peace,' NBC News reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is not serious about reaching a peace deal with Ukraine, NBC News reported on Feb. 18, citing unnamed Western intelligence officials and U.S. congressional officials. Russian and U.S. delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss potential steps towards peace negotiations. Ukraine was not invited to participate in the talks. &quot;We have zero intelligence that Putin is interested in a real peace deal right now,&quot; a U.S. congressional offical told NBC News. &quot;He thinks he&apos;s winning,&quot; a Western official added. One Western intelligence official said that Putin is unconcerned about high casualties in the Russian army. He is still interested in occupying all of Ukraine and believes Russia can outlast Ukraine and Europe, officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 18 that he was &quot;much more confident&quot; in securing a peace deal following the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh. He called the talks &quot;very good&quot; and claimed Russia was ready to begin the peace process. Trump reportedly wants to secure a ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by Easter, which falls on April 20. Over the past week, the U.S. has made several moves to advance its Russia-Ukraine agenda &#x2014; some of which have alarmed European and Ukrainian officials. European leaders met in Paris on Feb. 17 at an emergency summit in response to the U.S. holding bilateral talks with Russia without Ukraine or the EU. France will host a second summit on Feb. 19. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-shows-putin-not-ready-for-real-peace-nbc-news-reports/	2025-02-18T15:03:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Massive demolition site' — Trump claims Ukraine in ruins while pressing Zelensky to hold elections	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 18 that he believes Ukraine should hold new elections, as the country has become a &quot;massive demolition site&quot; under President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Trump&apos;s comments come after U.S. and Russian officials earlier in the day met in Saudi Arabia &#x2014;&#xA0;without Ukraine &#x2014; to discuss strategies for ending the full-scale war. Ukraine should hold elections because Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating,&quot; Trump alleged without evidence while speaking to reporters on Feb. 18. Recent polling from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology shows that as of December 2024, 52% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky. The Kremlin has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Under the Ukrainian consitution, elections cannot be held during martial law, which went into effect after Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trump distanced himself from the Russian narrative, claiming that it was his personal opinion that Ukraine should hold elections. &quot;That&apos;s not a Russia thing. That&apos;s something coming from me,&quot; he said. Trump went on to describe the destruction of Ukraine in exaggerated terms, falsely claiming that the majority of its cities had been &quot;blown to smithereens.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know how anybody even lives there,&quot; he said. Instead of condemning Russia for launching daily attacks against Ukraine for nearly three years, Trump appeared to lay the blame in part on Zelensky&apos;s government. &quot;You have leadership now that&apos;s allowed the war to go on,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-demolition-site-trump-claims-ukraine-in-ruins-while-pressing-zelensky-to-hold-elections/	2025-02-18T14:44:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198556036.jpg
Trump 'much more confident' in peace deal after 'very good' US-Russia talks	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;much more confident&quot; that he will secure a ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine following talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. A U.S. delegation met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Riyadh on Feb. 18 to initiate talks on ending the war. Ukraine was excluded entirely from the discussions. &#xA0; Speaking to reporters from his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump called the talks &quot;very good.&quot; Trump claimed that &quot;a lot more people than you think&quot; had been killed during the war in Ukraine and said that Russia was prepared to end the &quot;barbarianism.&quot; He also dismissed the idea that Ukraine might feel betrayed at its exclusion from the negotiating table in Saudi Arabia. &#xA0; &quot;They&apos;ve had a seat for three years,&quot; he said. The U.S. president said that he was not opposed to the possibility of European peacekeeping forces monitoring an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;If they want to do that, that&apos;s great, I&apos;m all for it,&quot; he said. &quot;We won&apos;t have to put any over there, because you know, we&apos;re very far away.&quot; Trump also said the U.S. is not looking to withdraw its own troops stationed in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-much-more-confident-in-peace-deal-after-very-good-us-russia-talks/	2025-02-18T14:09:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Smaller Western force could guarantee security in Ukraine, Guardian reports	A relatively small contingent of Western troops could successfully provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, U.K. defense sources told the Guardian on Feb. 18. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Guardian that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 troops on Ukraine&apos;s front lines to effectively deter Russia. A much smaller European-led peacekeeping force could rely on intelligence, surveillance, and long-range monitoring to enforce a ceasefire rather than large numbers of troops on the ground, unnamed U.K. defense sources said. &#xA0; Such a force could number in the tens of thousands, or even fewer, sources said. In one proposed alternative scenario, long-range monitoring replaced European troops altogether. Other U.K. military sources said that in the most likely scenario, the U.K. would contribute one or two brigades to the European peacekeeping effort in Ukraine. A brigade consists of a few thousand soldiers. European leaders will convene in France on Feb. 19 for a high-level summit on Ukrainian security. The meeting is the second emergency summit on the topic that Paris has hosted this week and comes one day after U.S. and Russian officials met for talks in Saudi Arabia that excluded Ukraine and Europe altogether. During the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow would not accept the deployment of any NATO troops in Ukraine after a ceasefire deal. French President Emmanuel Macron has been the leading voice behind the proposal of European ground troops as an alternative security guarantee for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled willingness to deploy British troops as part of such a plan. Participating European nations could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers to Ukraine, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 17, citing unnamed sources familiar with the discussions. U.K. sources would not confirm this figure while talks were underway, but indicated to the Guardian that a force of that size was more likely than Zelensky&apos;s proposed number. Starmer will visit Washington, D.C. next week, where he is expected to press U.S. President Donald Trump to provide more security assurances for Kyiv to support the European peacekeeping effort. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Europe to shoulder the burden of funding and monitoring Ukrainian security.	https://kyivindependent.com/smaller-western-force-could-guarantee-security-in-ukraine-guardian-reports/	2025-02-18T13:48:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199589329.jpg
Saudi Arabia wanted Ukraine represented at US-Russia talks, Bloomberg reports	Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, wanted President Volodymyr Zelensky to be represented in talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18, citing a person with knowledge of the plans. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other officials in Saudia Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first direct negotiations between the two countries since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the talks was not Saudi Arabia&apos;s choice, a source with knowledge of the Saudi preparations told Bloomberg. U.S. and Russian officials reportedly insisted to Mohammed bin Salman that they wanted to hold the meeting without Ukrainians present. The prince had intended to brief Zelensky on Saudi Arabia&apos;s role in hosting the discussions and his own talks with Moscow and Washington. Zelensky postponed a planned visit to Saudia Arabia due to the talks between Russia and the U.S. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said after a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Zelensky said he had spoken with bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for March 10. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe. Zelensky has repeatedly stressed that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Rubio claimed on Feb. 16 that the Riyadh talks were an exploratory first step, rather than official negotiations, and that Ukraine and Europe would participate once the official discussions began.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-arabia-wanted-ukraine-represented-at-us-russia-talks-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-18T12:39:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199708861.jpg
Plokhy argues in Chornobyl occupation book that Russia’s nuclear blackmail is ‘warning for the future’	The specter of nuclear war cast a long shadow over the 20th century, serving as a reminder of humanity&apos;s capacity for self-destruction. Now, as the world seems to shrug off Russia&#x2019;s nuclear saber-rattling against Ukraine &#x2014; and by extension, all of humanity &#x2014; a haunting question calls for an answer: Have we grown dangerously numb to the threat of a looming apocalypse? Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Chernobyl Roulette&#x201D; chronicles the 35-day occupation of the Chornobyl nuclear plant at the start of the full-scale war, highlighting the harrowing day-to-day experiences that the nearly 300 Ukrainians &#x2014; firefighters, operators, and members of the National Guard &#xA0;&#x2014; who were stationed there had to endure. (Plokhy, somewhat perplexingly, distinguishes between the Ukrainian &quot;Chornobyl&quot; and the Russian &quot;Chernobyl,&#x201D; in the book, using Ukrainian spelling to refer to the territory under independent Ukraine, while the latter refers to the nuclear plant and the site of the infamous disaster during Soviet times). Among the recollections from plant workers are instances such as having to persuade the occupying Russian soldiers not to disturb the 1986 disaster site in their misguided quest for &#x201C;proof&#x201D; of hidden nuclear weapons. They believed that there were hidden &#x201C;American laboratories allegedly working on the production of Ukrainian nuclear weapons,&#x201D; as Plokhy writes. After an initial search turned up nothing, the Russian soldiers reportedly considered digging into the mounds erected over the debris from the 1986 nuclear disaster. The plant workers convinced them otherwise, warning that doing so would only put the Russian soldiers at risk of nuclear contamination. As Plokhy puts it, the Russian soldiers realized upon listening to them they &#x201C;would be digging their own radioactive grave.&#x201D; Despite such tense standoffs during the occupation, the bravery and quick thinking of Chornobyl&apos;s workers helped prevent another nuclear disaster. Yet, nearly three years later, Russia continues its nuclear blackmail. The gap between those who rely on logic and those driven by blind propaganda has only widened, leaving little room for persuasion or reason. On Feb. 14, Russia launched a long-range Shahed drone at the nuclear plant, breaking through the &#x201C;sarcophagus,&#x201D; &#xA0;the protective structure covering the remnants of reactor number four, which exploded in the 1986 disaster.

(Andrew Kravchenko / Bloomberg via Getty Images)In the most extensively documented war in modern history, where each passing week unveils a new, seemingly unimaginable tragedy that risks overshadowing the last, a book that chronicles a decisive moment of the war is not only valuable but essential. The erasure of history, after all, is a key force driving Russian soldiers to take up arms and invade a neighboring country, fueling Russian leader Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s delusional claims that Russia&#x2019;s mission is to &quot;denazify&quot; Ukraine. That ignorance was laid bare during the occupation of Chornobyl when Russian soldiers, upon seizing the nuclear plant, demanded that leadership surrender &quot;Banderites&quot; and members of the Right Sector, a coalition of ultra-nationalist groups that have come to be seen as a sort of Ukrainian boogeyman in Russian propaganda. Plokhy describes in the book how Valentyn Heiko, a night shift foreman at the station, inquired about their criteria for identifying such individuals and was met with silence; he boldly suggested they start with him. Plokhy also writes how Heiko was among those who dealt with Russian forces directly during the occupation, striving to negotiate conditions that would allow the Ukrainian staff at the plant to continue their work undisturbed. Defiant yet pragmatic, Heiko told the Russian soldiers at the start of the occupation, &#x201C;Even though I detest you, I swore before the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to uphold nuclear security,&#x201D; and emphasized that Chornobyl was not just any nuclear facility, but a post-accident plant with unique, critical concerns. The Russian capture of Chornobyl had been swift and without violence. As Plokhy highlights throughout the book, the plant&#x2019;s workers were constantly &#x201C;trying to balance loyalty to their families, their homeland, and innocent civilians in Ukraine and beyond who would suffer the consequences of a nuclear accident should it occur.&#x201D; Russian soldiers&apos; threats to attack the Chornobyl plant &#x2014; despite the 1986 disaster being a shared history between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus &#x2014; left many Ukrainians who came of age during that period in disbelief. &#x201C;We liquidated the (consequences of the) accident together. For them to do this to us now just makes me feel sorry for (those people),&#x201D; Ivan Kovalchuk, a firefighter involved in the 1986 cleanup, remarked. A Russian serviceman patrols around the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, on May 1, 2022. (Andrey Borodulin / AFP via Getty Images)Southward, in Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia Oblast &#x2014; a city where nearly a quarter of the 53,000 residents worked at Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear plant &#x2014; efforts unfolded to defend the plant and prevent another occupation of a nuclear facility. Plokhy recounts how the initial Russian attempt to seize the city was thwarted by defiant locals who outright rejected them. Russian forces, &quot;surprised not to have been welcomed,&quot; initially turned back before launching their assault. As Russian forces opened fire on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Plokhy writes, its employees scrambled to reduce the power level of an active reactor, broadcasting a desperate plea over the loudspeaker: &#x201C;Stop shooting at a dangerous nuclear facility! Stop shooting immediately! You are threatening the security of the whole world!&#x201D; The warning went unheeded. Citing reports from Ukrainian military intelligence, Plokhy also writes about how Russian occupiers mined the area surrounding the plant. Those remaining in Enerhodar are forced to take Russian passports under threat of violence. One of the most striking critiques in Plokhy&apos;s book is his examination of the IAEA&apos;s muted response at the onset of the full-scale war. While Ukrainian nuclear plant workers pushed themselves to the brink, both physically and mentally, to avert a global catastrophe, the IAEA initially refrained from directly condemning Russia for its nuclear blackmail, a silence that raises troubling questions about accountability. One example is Director General Rafael Grossi&#x2019;s statement on Feb. 25, 2022, when he referred to &#x201C;unidentified armed forces&#x201D; at the nuclear plant. While there were technically no insignia identifying the soldiers as Russian citizens, as was the case during the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, &#x201C;everyone knew who the occupiers were&#x201D; at that point, as Plokhy writes. The IAEA &#x201C;would take not hours or days but weeks&#x201D; to condemn Russia by name. Even in the aftermath of the recent Feb. 14 attack, which penetrated the sarcophagus, the IAEA did nothing to condemn Russia. In a post on X, the official account&#x2019;s statement only read that &#x201C;the IAEA team at the Chornobyl site heard an explosion&#x201D; and that they &#x201C;were informed&#x201D; that a drone had struck the roof. One possible explanation for the IAEA&#x2019;s measured response could lie in its relationship with Russia itself. As Plokhy points out, Russia plays a significant role as a major donor to the IAEA. Moreover, one of Director General Grossi&apos;s six deputy directors, Mikhail Chudakov, is a seasoned figure from Russia&apos;s nuclear industry. Chudakov&apos;s role at the IAEA has raised significant concerns about conflicts of interest, particularly due to his leadership of its Department of Nuclear Energy. This department, which oversees the expansion of nuclear energy into new markets, aligns with the strategic interests of companies like Rosatom, the Russian state-owned nuclear energy giant with which Chudakov had prior professional associations. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi (R) in Sochi, Russia on March 6, 2024. (Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;It was only the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War and Rosatom&#x2019;s involvement in the takeover of the Chernobyl nuclear plant that attracted global attention to Grossi&#x2019;s deputy,&#x201D; Plokhy writes. The Swiss energy counselor wrote to Grossi, urging that Chudakov be excluded from any dealings related to Ukraine and that his access to classified information be restricted. As of this book review, however, Chudakov remains one of Grossi&#x2019;s deputy director generals and continues to lead the IAEA&#x2019;s Department of Nuclear Energy. The success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in northern Kyiv Oblast led to the Russian withdrawal from Chornobyl by the end of March 2022. Simultaneously, several Russian soldiers were diagnosed with acute radiation poisoning, as it was later revealed that they had been digging fortifications in the Red Forest, one of the most highly contaminated areas on the planet. Russian soldiers&#x2019; ignorance led them to believe they were invading Ukraine to &quot;save&quot; its people, just as they were wrong in their understanding of the plant&apos;s operations, convinced that American-supplied plutonium for Ukrainian nuclear weapons could be stored there without the knowledge of international organizations like the IAEA. Despite the plant workers repeatedly exposing their ignorance during the occupation, the Russian soldiers remained steadfast in their delusions, even attempting &#x2014; unsuccessfully &#x2014; to recruit some as collaborators. Although another catastrophe at Chornobyl has been avoided, the ongoing Russian aerial attacks and the occupation of Europe&apos;s largest nuclear plant in Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast underscore the precariousness of the situation and Russia&#x2019;s continued nuclear blackmail against the world. Meanwhile, Russia&apos;s continued membership in organizations like the United Nations and the IAEA raises doubts about the effectiveness and integrity of the international institutions meant to avoid such conflicts. Regardless of how the coming weeks and months unfold in the war, Plokhy warns that Russia&apos;s nuclear threats serve as a stark &#x201C;warning for the future&#x201D; in an increasingly conflict-ridden world.

US-Russia talks on Ukraine peace — why Putin will be ‘very happy’	Russia on Feb. 18 ended years of political isolation sparked by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as a delegation of Kremlin officials met with their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to end the very war it started. The talks ended with little in the way of concrete agreements, but the very fact it happened &#x2014; without Ukraine &#x2014; is a huge win for Moscow. &quot;Even if nothing comes of it, the fact that Russian and American senior officials sat down together behind closed doors and talked about this issue without the Ukrainians there &#x2014; that&apos;s huge,&quot; Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;That&apos;s absolutely huge, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin must be very, very happy about all of that.&quot; The talks in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. &quot;This is only the very tentative start of a bilateral process,&quot; former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent, stressing that &quot;nothing much&quot; had been decided as they&apos;re &quot;talks, not negotiations.&quot; The U.S. delegation was keen to stress that today&apos;s talks were just the start of a &quot;long and difficult journey, though Rubio said he is &quot;convinced&quot; Russia is &quot;willing to begin to engage in a serious process&quot; to end its full-scale invasion. Speaking after the talks concluded, Russia&apos;s Lavrov said three main points had been agreed on &#x2014; restoring embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions, appointing representatives to further the negotiation process, and creating the necessary conditions for restarting U.S.-Russia relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during an awarding ceremony at Moscow State University in Moscow, Russia on Jan. 24, 2025. (Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Putin will be glad with the photo op and Russia being portrayed as a superpower on the level of the U.S. when it&#x2019;s nowhere near,&quot; Foreman said. The initial response from the Russian delegation was rather muted, with Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Putin, saying the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. While the talks were underway, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin is ready for talks with Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law. Speaking after the talks ended, Lavrov continued the attacks on Zelensky, saying that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region on Feb. 17.

Mathers said Lavrov being able to say such things on the world stage was &quot;particularly galling,&quot; adding that how the talks were being conducted gave the appearance that there is &quot;absolutely no acknowledgement by the Americans that Russia is the party in the wrong.&quot; Speaking after the talks concluded, Rubio was keen to stress that today&apos;s talks were the &quot;first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one.&quot; He added that &quot;these are the kind of things&quot; that advance through &quot;hard and difficult diplomacy in closed rooms over a period of time.&quot; &quot;In order for a conflict to end, everyone in that conflict has to be okay with it, it has to be acceptable to them,&quot; he said, adding Trump &quot;wants it to end in a way that&apos;s sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict in two or three years.&quot; But at the same time, U.S negotiator Mike Waltz said Trump is determined to move very quickly on talks over a potential peace deal in Ukraine, adding that &quot;an endless war in Europe is not acceptable to Trump.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any big surprises except that Marco Rubio keeps looking more and more out of his depth,&quot; Mathers said, adding he looks like he &quot;really wishes he were somewhere else.&quot; &quot;Every expression on his face is like &apos;gosh, I&apos;ve fallen in with a bad crowd, haven&apos;t I?&apos; It looks like somebody who&apos;s kind of being held hostage by the mob,&quot; she added. Rubio also suggested that lifting sanctions against Russia would be part of any peace process, saying that &quot;concessions&quot; would have to be made by &quot;all sides&quot; to bring an end to &quot;any conflict.&quot; He added that the EU would &quot;have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.&quot; Speaking at a press conference in Turkey where he&apos;d arrive the night before, President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the talks ended that he was canceling a planned visit to Saudi Arabia where he had been expected to hold separate talks with U.S. officials. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; he said. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement.

Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. Explaining how the day&apos;s events were perceived in Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmaker and head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, said the Kremlin&apos;s comments about Zelensky&apos;s &quot;legitimacy&quot; and Lavrov&apos;s attacks were a deliberate ploy, made while his top officials were front and center on the international stage. &quot;Russia wants to make Ukraine hold elections before the end of war in the hope that it will undermine unity and stability within the country,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Putin is not going to change. While he stays in power he is bent on destroying Ukraine one way or another, he said, adding: &quot;It is absolutely senseless to negotiate with him. He is using negotiations with the U.S. to pretend that he is not politically isolated.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-talks-on-ukraine-peace-why-putin-will-be-very-happy/	2025-02-18T12:23:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199658460.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 14	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 14 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 10&#x2013;Feb. 16, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Selection commission completes initial review of candidates for Bureau of Economic Security director Last week, the selection commission wrapped up its preliminary review of applications for the position of Bureau of Economic Security director. The commission decided to reach out to several candidates whose documentation requires additional details or clarification, particularly concerning their previous experience. This procedural step is part of the technical screening process, after which the commission will determine which candidates will advance to the next stage of the competitive selection process. Parliament backs ARMA reform bill in first reading Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada has approved, in its first reading, draft law #12374-d, which introduces reforms to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA). The draft law, drafted by Anti-Corruption Policy Committee Chair Anastasiia Radina and Economic Committee Deputy Chair Oleksii Movchan, was supported as the committee&#x2019;s consolidated version. The legislation outlines a competitive selection process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, giving international experts a decisive vote in the selection commission. Under the Ukraine Facility, the bill must be adopted in full by March 31, 2025, to fulfill the country&apos;s reform commitments. Ukrainian Parliament approves Energoatom&apos;s purchase of Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria The Verkhovna Rada has passed an amendment to draft law #11392, granting state-owned Energoatom permission to purchase Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP). The deal involves acquiring two Rosatom reactors initially intended for the unfinished Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria. Energoatom plans to spend $1 billion on the purchase for further construction of reactor units #3 and #4 at the KhNPP. This decision was made despite the fact that lawmakers haven&#x2019;t yet passed the necessary legislation authorizing the actual construction of the new units. Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security Council imposes price regulation on essential medicines Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) has announced a 30% price reduction on the country&#x2019;s most essential and in-demand medications, effective March 1, 2025. Moreover, the decision includes a recommendation for the Office of the Prosecutor General to work with law enforcement agencies in identifying and preventing potential financial abuses and non-transparent pricing practices in the pharmaceutical sector. Ukrainian business supports general course of reforms but doubts anti-corruption efforts, &#x2013; key findings from the Technology of Progress&apos;s business survey The NGO Technology of Progress and the Gradus research agency conducted a survey of 75 owners, executives, and top management of medium and large businesses in Ukraine. Sixty-one percent of respondents believe that Ukraine is moving in the right direction in implementing reforms in line with international commitments (to the EU, IMF, World Bank, etc.). This indicates a relatively high level of trust in the overall course of reforms in Ukraine. Additionally, 53% assess reform progress in 2024 as &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;high,&quot; while only 14% believe there has been no progress. (Technology of Progress NGO and Gradus research agency)At the same time, survey results reflect a lack of business confidence in the government&#x2019;s anti-corruption efforts. Fifty-three percent of respondents do not believe that the level of corruption in Ukraine decreased in 2024. Moreover, 63% of respondents feel negative pressure from the current economic environment.These results indicate significant economic challenges faced by businesses in Ukraine, likely linked to macroeconomic instability, high business costs, and the impact of the war.

Ukraine war latest: Russia, US conclude Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin advisor calls them 'not bad'	Key developments on Feb. 18: A member of Russia&apos;s delegation that met with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine has said the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. Speaking to the pro-Kremlin Channel One Russia, Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin, said it was a &quot;very serious discussion of all the issues we wanted to touch upon.&quot; &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, the first official face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Speaking after the talks, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the meeting was &quot;an important step forward,&quot; but added: &quot;One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.&quot; Ushakov also said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin were discussed, but it was unlikely to take place next week as had been previously speculated. Yet, U.S negotiator Mike Waltz stressed that Trump is determined to move very quickly on talks over a potential peace deal in Ukraine, adding that &quot;an endless war in Europe is not acceptable to Trump.&quot; Separate teams of negotiators from the United States and Russia will start communicating on Ukraine &quot;in due course,&quot; according to Ushakov. The participants of the meeting in Riyadh also decided to restore embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions. &quot;We&apos;re going to need to have vibrant diplomatic missions that are able to function normally in order to be able to continue these conduits,&quot; Rubio said. Answering a question about Europe&apos;s absence in Saudi Arabia, Rubio siad that &quot;no one is being sidelined here.&quot; He added that &quot;some very positive things for the United States, for Europe, for Ukraine, for the world&quot; could emerge, but &quot;the conflict&quot; must end first. &quot;In order for a conflict to end, everyone in that conflict has to be okay with it, it has to be acceptable to them,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one,&quot; he added. Russia and the U.S. also held separate talks on economic cooperation, including on global energy prices, Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters. Dmitriev added that the recent meeting between Russia and the U.S. has &quot;rejected&quot; the logic of talks under the Joe Biden administration. &quot;There&apos;s a new logic where we need to talk and understand what we agree upon and if there are differences we need to understand what they are,&quot; he said. Though the U.S. and Russia met without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he had postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said during a briefing following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. He also said he expects U.S. officials to visit Ukraine, confirming that Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 19. &quot;Any country has a bilateral track with other countries. Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The president also announced that he had spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for Mar. 10. In a Feb. 17 interview with German media network ARD, Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal and reaffirmed that Ukraine would not accept an agreement brokered without its participation. Ukraine&apos;s military has received over 10,000 applications from volunteer recruits aged 18 to 24 following the introduction of lucrative &quot;special contracts,&quot; Defense Ministry Spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said on Ukrainian TV on Feb. 17. The contracts, aimed at recruiting additional military personnel who are not subject to mobilization, provide a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies have continuously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with President Volodymyr Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. A one-year contract option would likely appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Two explosions took place on the oil tanker Seajewel, moored in the Italian city of Savona on Feb. 18, with the vessel allegedly transporting Russian oil to Europe, Italian publication IVG reported. The cause of the blasts remains unknown, but initial evidence suggests possible sabotage, including damage below the waterline and a fish kill near the tanker. The Seajewel, part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to evade sanctions, had previously loaded oil in Russia three times in 2024, according to Ukrainian Pravda (UP). The crew reported hearing two loud bangs, and the tanker&apos;s hull showed concave damage, indicating the possible placement of explosive devices. UP revealed that the tanker had recently unloaded in the Romanian port of Constanta after arriving from Turkey and was reportedly heading to Novorossiysk, Russia, for reloading. The Savona Coast Guard is investigating the incident with divers, though no further details have been released. Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; consists of aging tankers used to circumvent sanctions, including those imposed by the EU, U.K., and U.S. Ukraine recently sanctioned captains of these vessels, targeting Russian and Iranian nationals involved in illicit oil exports. A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as sanctions intensify, disrupting Moscow&apos;s oil export logistics and forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 18 that Moscow had not seen a three-point peace plan and warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine. The alleged plan, which reportedly includes a ceasefire, elections in Ukraine, and a final peace agreement, was revealed by Fox News Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on X. &quot;I have not seen this information, I have not seen these reports,&quot; Lavrov said at a press conference following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Lavrov also warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. He claimed that even if Western troops operated under EU or national flags, rather than NATO&apos;s, it would still be a &quot;direct threat&quot; to Russia. &quot;The absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic Alliance is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,&quot; he claimed. Kyiv said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. Lavrov further escalated rhetoric against President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region. &quot;This should only strengthen everyone in the opinion that this can&apos;t go on, that this man and his entire team should be calmed down, given a slap on the wrist,&quot; he said. Europe is ready and willing to take a leadership role in providing Ukraine with security guarantees, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wrote on Feb. 17 on X. Rutte&apos;s remarks came after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a Paris summit of European powers. The summit was held before the beginning of the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Ready and willing. That&apos;s my take from today&apos;s meeting in Paris,&quot; Rutte wrote. &quot;Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided, but the commitment is clear,&quot; Rutte added. During the Paris meeting, the participants discussed the defense capabilities that Europe could provide to Ukraine to ensure reliable security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of Russia&apos;s clear ceasefire violation, according to The Guardian. European leaders are concerned about the potential imposition of neutrality on Ukraine and joint U.S.-Russian powers&apos; sharing of agreed-upon spheres of influence following the negotiations. The European Union must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift, EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Feb. 18. &quot;With the current Trump administration, the EU will need to take issues related to the bloc&apos;s security more into its own hands. That also concerns sanctions policy,&quot; Dombrovskis said during a meeting with journalists in Brussels. The commissioner added that work on preparing the 16th package of sanctions against Russia is ongoing. His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that the EU would eventually need to be involved in discussions over sanctions relief as part of ongoing talks with Russia. &quot;The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well,&quot; Rubio said after U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. The Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations on Feb. 15. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales. France plans to host another high-level meeting on Feb. 19 to discuss Ukraine and European security, expanding participation to countries left out of the initial summit, Reuters reported on Feb. 18, citing diplomatic sources. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the first Paris summit on Feb. 17, bringing together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. The talks focused on Ukraine&apos;s security, its potential NATO membership, and Europe&apos;s broader defense strategy. According to Reuters, Paris has now invited additional European countries and Canada to join the upcoming meeting, either in person or via video link. The expanded guest list includes Norway, Canada, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Romania, Sweden, and Belgium. The move follows recent U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia, marking the first direct talks between Washington and Moscow since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed his planned visit to Saudi Arabia, reiterating that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future should be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.

Ukraine summit in Paris exposes divisions, lack of coherent plan, experts say	The emergency Ukraine summit held in Paris by European leaders on Feb. 17 exposed divisions between European countries, highlighting how they have so far failed to agree on a coherent plan for supporting Kyiv, analysts have told the Kyiv Independent. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the summit after Brussels and Kyiv were sidelined from negotiations in Saudi Arabia on ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as concerns mount that both Europe and Kyiv may be left without U.S. support. Adding to tensions on the continent, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. The Paris summit was attended by leaders of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The participants considered increasing defense spending, providing security guarantees to Kyiv, and sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Speaking after the summit, Macron reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. &quot;Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense &#x2014; both for today and for the future,&quot; he said in his statement on X. Yet there were no concrete agreements, and little consensus among statements issued by others in attendance. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he is &quot;prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground, alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gives a statement following the informal summit of European leaders on the situation in Ukraine and European security, at the German Embassy in Paris, on Feb. 17, 2025. (Behrouz Mehri / AFP via Getty Images)But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz argued that it was &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; to discuss sending peacekeepers before a specific peace plan is approved. Here&#x2019;s what five European experts think about the results of the Paris summit and what Europe should do next to support Ukraine: European Council on Foreign Relations Looking at the outcome of the Paris meeting, it is still clear that Europeans do not agree on how, and to what degree to support Ukraine, particularly if they need to defy the United States to do so. This extends to issues beyond just the headline question of deploying European troops to Ukraine and extends to issues such as security guarantees, the level and kind of military assistance, reconstruction aid, and even the definition of victory. Unless and until they reach such agreement, Europeans will not have much if any say in the negotiations. Whether they feel they need that and whether they are willing to put in more resources and make compromises with their EU partners is, I guess, a question they need to ask themselves. a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs We Europeans still have difficulties accepting that &#x2014; at least for now and for this presidency &#x2014; the United States is no longer a reliable ally, and is possibly even an opponent. Regime change has happened in Washington, however, and the informal summit in Paris tried to come to terms with the implications &#x2014; that Europe will have to do a lot more to support Ukraine. The emphasis here is on &quot;do,&quot; rather than just &quot;say&quot; things that help Ukraine. Europe&apos;s problem is that it will find that difficult even if it wants to support Ukraine, beyond providing money &#x2014; too many countries in Europe have neglected their defenses and their defense industries for too long. a defense and security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations My sense is that European leaders are converging on a set of financial measures to mobilize additional money for defense. The goal is to allow European states to boost defense spending to build up their own armed forces and sustain military aid to Ukraine as US support for both Ukraine and European security more broadly is perceived to be crumbling. Two big questions remained unanswered in Paris on Monday. One, will Europeans deploy troops to Ukraine, under which conditions, and with what mandate? And two, what is the right balance to strike between favoring the European defense industry to assert greater sovereignty from the U.S., and procuring equipment from the U.S. to keep the Trump administration engaged in European security affairs? We&#x2019;ll probably learn more next week after Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 federal election. It seems that the democratic parties of the political center have agreed on the contours of a plan to reform Germany&#x2019;s debt break to boost defense spending sooner rather than later and to expand Germany&#x2019;s role as a key security provider in Europe. But they&#x2019;re keeping their cards close to their chest to not add fuel to the populist fire being stirred by the far-right and far-left parties, both of which are decidedly pro-Russian.

(Christophe Petit Tesson / AFP via Getty Images)Pavel Havliceka research fellow at the Association for International Affairs The meeting was a clear political reaction to the Munich Security Conference that brought some bad news for the EU and Ukraine, and demanded a political follow-up at the highest level. Only some of the EU countries were invited, especially those that are prominent and powerful enough as well as capable of delivering financial support and dedication to Ukraine. But the results are mixed, exposing the existing divisions among the EU countries and states that want to join the peace-keeping efforts in Ukraine, and those that remain rather lukewarm on this. At the same time, the wide consensus was on more military spending and investments as well as maintaining political unity and a strong Transatlantic bond. At the same time, it is clear that Europe needs both more time and vigilance to respond to the ongoing challenges, and to stand up to the challenges from Russia and more pressure from the United States too. This is both the case when speaking to the general public in the EU as well as when securing additional financial support, investments, and more projects and military capabilities. a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs Yes, Europe certainly still needs to do much more. My expectation from the meeting on Monday would have been that the participants agree to come up with a draft plan within the next week or two of how European countries can provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Since it is unrealistic to do this without some form of U.S. support, the plan should indicate where this support is essential, i.e. what would be the minimal amount of support needed from the U.S. for the plan to succeed. It should also detail what the Europeans are able to provide. This needs to be a realistic assessment but also one which &quot;hurts,&quot; i.e. where the European countries leave their comfort zone and pledge to provide the maximum possible support. Even if this requires them to take actions which will negatively affect their own security, they need to do it, because their security is being protected in Ukraine, and if they fail to help protect it there then they will have to sacrifice much more in order to defend it on their own territory or that of allied NATO countries. Even if (U.S. President) Donald Trump is unpredictable, his statements recently and during his first administration leave no doubt that he expects Europe to do more for its own security. So relying on some sort of vague hope that he might change his mind and continue to provide the same amount of support for European security as has previously been the case is naive and dangerous. Unfortunately we did not see any sort of plan, or indication of a forthcoming plan, coming out of the meeting in Paris. European leaders need to realize that in order to have a seat at tables they consider relevant for them in the future, they will need to back up their rhetoric with much more convincing action, and they will need to begin immediately. defense and security senior programme manager at Globsec The interesting decision not to invite all EU leaders was poorly received by the rest of the bloc, once again providing figures like (Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban and (Slovakian Prime Minister) Robert Fico with an opportunity to push narratives of conflicting interests and divisions among EU member states. The real danger here is that public perception may shift toward believing in a division within the EU &#x2014; between &quot;warmongers&quot; and &quot;peace supporters.&quot; At this stage, rather than wake up calls, we should talk about &quot;final call&quot; for the EU to prove its voice matters and support Ukraine in the negotiation talks. Years of effort to back Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for survival would be wasted if a poor deal is reached &#x2014; affecting the credibility of the EU project for years to come. This is the EU&#x2019;s final call to show leadership. It is up to (EU Chief) Ursula von der Leyen to engage with the U.S. and ensure that any agreement reached serves Ukraine&#x2019;s best interests &#x2014; rather than merely ticking an item off a diplomatic to &#x2014; do list. It is time to honour the promises the EU has made, for Ukraine, for Europe and for all of us believing in a democratic free world.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-summit-in-paris-exposes-divisions-lack-of-coherent-plan-experts-say/	2025-02-18T11:49:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199562091.jpg
EU plans $6.2 billion military aid package for Ukraine ahead of US-Russia talks, Politico reports	The European Union is discussing a military aid package for Ukraine worth at least 6 billion euros ($6.2 billion) to bolster Kyiv&apos;s strategic position ahead of U.S.-led talks with Russia, Politico reported on Feb. 18, citing sources familiar with the matter. The package is expected to include 1.5 million artillery shells, air defense systems, and equipment for military brigades. According to Politico, the value of the aid could increase to 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion) depending on individual EU member states&apos; contributions. The initiative comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urges Europe to take on a greater role in security and military support for Ukraine. EU nations will have the option to contribute either financially or through direct military assistance, with contributions expected to be proportional to their gross national income. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the package at their upcoming meeting in Brussels next week. Unanimous approval is unlikely due to opposition from Hungary, meaning the aid may be structured as a coalition of willing countries rather than a formal EU-wide initiative. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly leader, has consistently opposed sanctions on Moscow and criticized military aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war. Ukraine remains heavily reliant on U.S. military assistance, but funds previously approved by Congress during the former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration are nearly depleted. Future weapons aid is now contingent on congressional approval and Trump&apos;s decisions, giving him significant leverage in shaping U.S. support for Ukraine. Zelensky has estimated that U.S. weapons account for about 40% of Ukraine&apos;s total arms supply, underscoring Washington&apos;s continued role in Kyiv&apos;s defense despite efforts to ramp up domestic production and secure greater European military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-6-2-billion-military-ukraine-aid-package-ahead-of-us-russia-talks-politico-reports/	2025-02-18T11:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
As Trump’s Ukraine envoy is partially sidelined, Middle East negotiator takes lead in Russia talks	As U.S.-Russian talks on ending the war in Ukraine kicked off in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, appears to have been partially sidelined from the negotiations. Kellogg will focus on talks with Ukraine and Europe, while Steve Witkoff is emerging as a key negotiator with Russia despite his role as Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy. Some experts attribute this to Kellogg&apos;s more pro-Ukrainian stance and Russia&apos;s alleged objections to him. He has advocated peace through strength and security guarantees for Ukraine. In contrast with Kellogg, Witkoff&apos;s views on Ukraine and Russia are unclear. There are fears that he might be more willing to agree to Russia&apos;s conditions. Witkoff brokered the Jan. 15 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and Trump may hope that he could achieve something similar in Ukraine, experts say. &quot;What he brings to the table in terms of Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine, other than his friendship with Trump, is not clear,&quot; John Herbst, an expert at the Atlantic Council and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. On Feb. 11, Witkoff negotiated the release of Marc Fogel, a teacher who had been arrested in Russia on charges of bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021. Fogel was flown out of the country on Witkoff&#x2019;s plane. When asked who he worked with in Russia to secure Fogel&apos;s release, Witkoff said that he had cooperated with someone named Kirill. Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing a source close to negotiations, that Kirill Dmitriyev, head of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, had taken part in talks on Fogel. Following Fogel&#x2019;s release, Trump announced on Feb. 12 that he had held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed to &quot;immediately&quot; start negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Trump said that he had tasked Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and John Ratcliffe, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, with leading the negotiations. Kellogg&apos;s name was notably missing from the list. Trump also said on Feb. 12 that his first meeting with Putin would take place in Saudi Arabia. Witkoff, Waltz and Rubio later traveled to Saudi Arabia and launched negotiations with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Feb. 18. There, the U.S. and Russia agreed to start the process on Ukrainian settlement, appoint ambassadors to each other, lift &quot;obstacles to diplomatic missions&quot; and create conditions for starting U.S.-Russian cooperation, according to Lavrov. Kellogg is scheduled to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19 but is not taking part in talks with Russia on ending the war. He has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. At the same time, Kellogg has publicly stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The plan does not stipulate a reduction in the Ukrainian army&apos;s size or recognizing occupied territories as Russian de jure. Herbst argued that &quot;the Russians did not like Kellogg, because he is the one who is talking about tough measures to get Moscow to negotiate, and negotiate in good faith.&quot; General Keith Kellogg, US special envoy for Ukraine, participates in the panel discussion &quot;Peace through Strength - A Plan for Ukraine&quot; at the 61st Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany on Feb. 15, 2025. (Johannes Simon / Getty Images)&quot;Kellogg was the most outspoken, the toughest,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And of course, I always felt that Putin would want to make sure that the key channel between Russia and the United States was Putin to Trump, not anything less. And certainly (Russia did not want) the guy who has been talking tough &#x2014; Kellogg.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, agreed, saying that &quot;Kellogg certainly seems to be the member of this administration who is the most sympathetic to Ukraine, although he is by no means a fervent supporter of all the terms that the Ukrainian government has identified as necessary for a genuine and sustainable peace.&quot; Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, said that Kellogg is &quot;one of the oldest and most experienced people in the team.&quot; &quot;He offers a strong balance with respect for Ukraine&#x2019;s national interests,&quot; Minakov told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He also listens to the European Commission. He represents knowledge, understanding, and a certain wisdom related to the interests of Kyiv and the EU.&quot; Some experts argue that Kellogg has been effectively sidelined. Daniel Hamilton, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, said that &quot;Trump has said Kellogg will play a role, but he no longer seems to be in the lead regarding the negotiations.&quot; Mathers said that &quot;it does look as though Kellogg is being given the work of visiting the European capitals, including Kyiv, whereas Witkoff has already been to Moscow, which is clearly regarded by Trump as the center of power.&quot; &quot;Kellogg has also not been included in the negotiating team that Trump has just named, which may be an oversight rather than a deliberate snub (this administration is not great on getting details right),&quot; Mathers said. &quot;But even if it is an oversight and he will be added later, it does reveal that Kellogg is not one of the people that Trump thinks of immediately in this context, despite appointing him as a special envoy to deal with Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Kellogg clarified on Feb. 15 that he would be focusing on negotiations with Ukraine and Europe, and Witkoff would be focusing on talks with Russia. Witkoff, a real estate investor and billionaire, is a long-time friend of Trump. After graduating from law school in 1983, Witkoff worked for the New York-based real estate law firm Dreyer &amp; Traub, and Trump was one of his clients. During Trump&apos;s first presidency, Witkoff was a member of the Great American Economic Revival Industry Group, which was created by Trump in 2020 to combat the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Witkoff is a long-time personal friend of Trump&apos;s and, like Trump, made his fortune in the New York real estate sector,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Trump is more comfortable around people he knows well and trusts, with personal loyalty being the key criteria for advancement in this administration.&quot; US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff attends an interview after meeting with Russian officials at Diriyah Palace, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 18, 2025. (Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)Aron Lund, a Middle East analyst at Century International, also said that &quot;Trump just trusts this guy on a personal level.&quot; &quot;We know he does not trust the U.S. governmental institutions very much, but this guy is an old friend of his, from a similar background,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We seem to be in for a period in which U.S. diplomacy gets more personality-centered and where proximity to the president may matter more than institutional positions.&quot; Lund added that Witkoff is going to run negotiations in both the Middle East and Ukraine and is &quot;about to become some sort of general presidential point man for tricky foreign business.&quot; Meanwhile, Herbst emphasized that Witkoff &quot;is not a professional diplomat and not a person who has done foreign affairs in his career&quot; but &quot;a successful businessman who is a friend of Trump.&quot; After being elected for a second term on Nov. 5, 2024, Trump nominated Witkoff as his special envoy for the Middle East. Even before Trump took office on Jan. 20, Wifkoff took part in brokering the Jan. 15 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The deal envisages exchanging all Israeli hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians held by Israel and Israel&apos;s gradual withdrawal from Gaza. Witkoff pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the agreement, saying that Trump wanted this deal done, according to sources cited by the New York Times. Witkoff&apos;s Middle Eastern contacts appear to have played a role in his negotiations with Russia as well. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took part as an intermediary in talks with Russia on Fogel&apos;s release, Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing a source close to the negotiations. &quot;Witkoff proved himself to Trump by working with the (former ex-President Joe) Biden administration to arrange the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and then to negotiate the release of U.S. teacher Mark Fogel from Russia,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;Witkoff has proven himself as a fixer and negotiator. He is assuming a larger role than his title suggests.&quot; Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that &quot;Witkoff doesn&#x2019;t really come to the job with deep experience in the Middle East or Russia and Ukraine but plays to Trump&#x2019;s desire to have someone who can get things done in transactional businessman style.&quot; &quot;On Gaza Witkoff was reportedly much more willing to enforce Trump&apos;s desires on Israel and it could be that we see something similar on Ukraine where he doesn&#x2019;t play nice but delivers Trump&#x2018;s message in no uncertain terms,&quot; he added. Mathers said that &quot;both Gaza and Russia/Ukraine involve hostages and the potential for trading hostages, so that may be the common factor and what unites them in Trump&apos;s mind.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump (C) in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, DC on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)The fact that peace negotiations with Russia are being held in Saudi Arabia may be linked to Witkoff&apos;s role as Middle East envoy. &quot;My guess is that Witkoff&apos;s Ukraine role is an outgrowth from his Middle East negotiations,&quot; Lund said. &quot;It seems that Witkoff was involved in stitching together the Putin-Trump summit, which Trump says he thinks will happen in Saudi Arabia. We know that Witkoff has been meeting the Saudis to discuss Gaza, Israel, and other things, so I assume that&apos;s where the summit location comes from.&quot; He added that Trump and Witkoff may &quot;hope to leverage the summit as a favor to the Saudis.&quot; &quot;The idea would be that since they get to host this major international event, with all the attention and prestige that entails, they should give something in return on Gaza or related to Israeli-Saudi normalization,&quot; Lund said. Despite Witkoff&apos;s role in talks on ending the war in Ukraine, his views on Ukraine and Russia are unknown, analysts say. Mathers said that she has not &quot;seen anything specific to indicate Witkoff&apos;s views on Russia, but Trump clearly regards him as a trusted envoy.&quot; Although Witkoff has been praised for brokering the Gaza deal, the implementation of the agreement has faced some problems, which may foreshadow similar difficulties if he hammers out a deal with Russia. On Feb. 10, Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and said it would suspend the release of the remaining 76 hostages. Trump said that &quot;all hell is going to break out&quot; if hostages were not released, and Netanyahu threatened to resume fighting. As a result, Hamas said on Feb. 13 that the hostages would be released. Another move that has caused a backlash from Palestinians and Arab countries is Trump&apos;s Feb. 4 proposal that the U.S. take over the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should leave it. Michael Sahlin, a Middle East expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said that it is not clear if the Gaza deal will lead to a sustainable and stable peace. But he believes that Witkoff&#x2019;s role in the Middle East and his talks with Russia may be connected. &#x201C;I have a suspicion that there could be a link between a big Trump package deal about the Middle East and a big package deal about Ukraine,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trumps-ukraine-envoy-is-partially-sidelined-middle-east-negotiator-takes-lead-in-russia-talks/	2025-02-18T11:25:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704934.jpg
France to host second summit on Ukraine, European security, Reuters reports	France plans to host another high-level meeting on Feb. 19 to discuss Ukraine and European security, expanding participation to countries left out of the initial summit, Reuters reported on Feb. 18, citing diplomatic sources. French President Emmanuel Macron convened the first Paris summit on Feb. 17, bringing together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. The talks focused on Ukraine&apos;s security, its potential NATO membership, and Europe&apos;s broader defense strategy. According to Reuters, Paris has now invited additional European countries and Canada to join the upcoming meeting, either in person or via video link. The expanded guest list includes Norway, Canada, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Romania, Sweden, and Belgium. The move follows recent U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia, marking the first direct talks between Washington and Moscow since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed his planned visit to Saudi Arabia, reiterating that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future should be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. The role of European nations in the negotiations with Russia remains unclear. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe would not be directly involved in the talks but assured that its interests would be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-host-another-summit-on-ukraine-european-security-reuters-reports/	2025-02-18T10:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Trump is trading Ukraine’s future for a quick win	As many others have now concluded, this year&#x2019;s Munich Security Conference (MSC) was pretty remarkable. Indeed, it may have been as defining an event as Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s infamous 2007 speech, which marked a shift toward a more openly hostile Russian policy toward the West. That shift led to Russia&#x2019;s subsequent invasion of Georgia in 2008, its initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and ultimately, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Figures like U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. Vice President JD Vance sent a clear message: Europe can no longer rely on the American security backstop. That realization hit hard. With Vance&#x2019;s speech, the realization also set in that Europe and U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s America no longer share the same values or interests. Europe places far greater importance on the rule of law, fighting corruption, and curbing kleptocracy. Free speech laws also diverge. These are the longer-term implications for Europe: First, Europe must prepare to defend itself without the U.S. If NATO is no longer viable, European nations will need to drastically increase defense spending &#x2014; potentially from 2% of GDP to 3% or perhaps even 5%. Second, Europe may need alternative security alliances &#x2014; potentially involving Turkey, Gulf states, or even China. The so-called &#x201C;Reverse Nixon&#x201D; strategy, where a Trump-Putin alliance seeks to isolate China, has been floated by the likes of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin and American political commentator Tucker Carlson. However, building an alternative security and defense arrangement to save Europe will take time. Europe must assume that Putin will not stop in Ukraine. It would be reckless not to prepare for further Russian aggression &#x2014; whether in Moldova, the Baltic states, or beyond. The best defense remains ensuring that Ukraine does not lose. A Ukrainian buffer buys Europe time to reinforce its defenses. The challenges herein are Trump&#x2019;s &#x201C;peace&#x201D; overtures to Putin and the looming Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia. Having given away much of the West&#x2019;s leverage, including NATO membership prospects and security guarantees for Ukraine, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine what Trump could deliver to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security. What, then, does Trump expect in return? So far, the Trump administration has made concession after concession to Russia. Putin likely sees Trump as a weak, incompetent negotiator and will push for maximum concessions &#x2014; such as restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s future military capabilities, regime change in Kyiv, or even constitutional changes that give Russia veto power over Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Russia will either exploit the limitations to invade again or the lack of security in Ukraine will ensure its future economic development fails. That would be a recipe for Ukraine&#x2019;s collapse. If Ukraine is destabilized, the consequences for Europe would be severe. Millions of Ukrainians could flee westward, overwhelming European economies and fueling far-right movements. Additionally, if Russia absorbs Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry &#x2014; the largest in Europe after Russia&#x2019;s own &#x2014; it would present an existential threat to Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a meeting at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017. (Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)No doubt, European politicians have argued the above to Trump until they were blue in the face. But to Trump, Ukraine, like Gaza, is just another real estate asset to be leveraged. That mindset was evident in U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, where he pressured Ukraine to sign away half of its natural resources in exchange for vague promises of future support. That mindset was evident in U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, where he pressured Ukraine to sign away half of its natural resources in exchange for vague promises of future support. Trump frames this as repayment for U.S. aid&#x2014;but the reality is that total U.S. assistance since 2022 remains under $100 billion, far from the &quot;hundreds of billions&quot; he claims. It is obscene to demand payment from a country that has lost hundreds of thousands of lives defending Western democracy. If Trump and Putin broker a deal that offers Ukraine no real security guarantees, Ukraine will likely reject it outright. Why agree to a ceasefire that leaves the country vulnerable to future Russian aggression? Trump clearly wants a speedy deal to secure his Nobel Peace Prize. Ukraine does still have significant leverage: nearly 1 million troops in the field, the ability to produce 40% of its own munitions, over $140 billion in reserves, and European support, as European leaders understand that Ukraine&#x2019;s survival is in their own best interest. For Russia, this means an extended war, continued sanctions, and a long-term military and economic drain. If Putin wants victory, he will still have to win it on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Ukraine can use its position to expose the U.S. as weak in the face of aggression, undermining U.S. credibility in the broader geopolitical struggle against China. Ukraine has little reason to cooperate with Trump&#x2019;s so-called peace plan, which amounts to a sellout. And for Europe, the stakes couldn&#x2019;t be higher.

EU must take Russia sanctions into 'its own hands,' commissioner says	The European Union must take greater control of its sanctions policy against Russia as U.S. priorities shift, EU Economy and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Feb. 18. &quot;With the current Trump administration, the EU will need to take issues related to the bloc&apos;s security more into its own hands. That also concerns sanctions policy,&quot; Dombrovskis said during a meeting with journalists in Brussels. The commissioner added that work on preparing the 16th package of sanctions against Russia is ongoing. His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that the EU would eventually need to be involved in discussions over sanctions relief as part of ongoing talks with Russia. &quot;The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well,&quot; Rubio said after U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held face-to-face negotiations with a U.S. delegation in Riyadh, marking the first direct talks between the two sides since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations on Feb. 15. The EU approved its 15th sanctions package against Moscow on Dec. 16. The package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as shipping companies facilitating Russia&apos;s crude oil sales.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-must-take-control-over-russia-sanctions-into-its-hands-commissioner-says/	2025-02-18T10:09:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258502154.jpg
Turkey 'ideal host' for peace talks on Russia-Ukraine war, Erdogan says	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Feb. 18 that Turkey is an ideal host for potential peace talks on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, offering Ankara as a venue for future negotiations. &quot;Our country is an ideal host for the negotiations that are likely to begin between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States,&quot; Erdogan said during a press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Erdogan highlighted Turkey&apos;s previous mediation efforts, including the Black Sea grain deal, which enabled Ukrainian agricultural exports until Russia withdrew in 2023. He reaffirmed that during his talks with Zelensky, Turkey expressed its support for Ukraine&apos;s complete territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence. &quot;At the same time, I emphasized that we would provide any support to complete the negotiations and establish sustainable peace. This war must end,&quot; Erdogan added. Zelensky, who postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia amid ongoing U.S.-Russia talks, reiterated that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations over its future. The Saudi talks on Feb. 18 marked the first direct discussions between U.S. and Russian officials since the full-scale invasion began, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meeting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier confirmed he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia &quot;very soon,&quot; though no date has been specified.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-ideal-host-for-peace-talks-on-russia-ukraine-war-erdogan-tells-zelensky/	2025-02-18T08:59:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/7daa8d5b756b4e1bf885ca6864040a32_1739881481.jpeg
Russia's Lavrov denies 3-point peace plan, warns against Western peacekeepers in Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 18 that Moscow had not seen a three-point peace plan and warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine. The alleged plan, which reportedly includes a ceasefire, elections in Ukraine, and a final peace agreement, was revealed by Fox News Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on X. &quot;I have not seen this information, I have not seen these reports,&quot; Lavrov said at a press conference following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Lavrov also warned that Russia would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. He claimed that even if Western troops operated under EU or national flags, rather than NATO&apos;s, it would still be a &quot;direct threat&quot; to Russia. &quot;The absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic Alliance is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,&quot; he claimed. Kyiv said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. Lavrov further escalated rhetoric against President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting that he and his team should be &quot;calmed down&quot; following a Ukrainian drone strike on a pumping station in Russia&apos;s Kuban region. &quot;This should only strengthen everyone in the opinion that this can&apos;t go on, that this man and his entire team should be calmed down, given a slap on the wrist,&quot; he said. The talks in Saudi Arabia mark the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since the full-scale invasion began. The Russian delegation, led by Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. He reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-lavrov-denies-knowledge-of-three-point-peace-plan-warns-against-western-troops-in-ukraine/	2025-02-18T08:15:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg

Zelensky postpones Saudi Arabia visit amid Russia-US talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 18 that he had postponed his visit to Saudi Arabia amid talks between Russia and the United States. &quot;We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us. I don&apos;t want any coincidences, so I&apos;m not going to Saudi Arabia,&quot; Zelensky said during a briefing following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. The talks in Saudi Arabia mark the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Zelensky reiterated that no decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future can be made without Kyiv&apos;s involvement. He also said he expects U.S. officials to visit Ukraine, confirming that Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 19. &quot;Any country has a bilateral track with other countries. Please, you can discuss anything, but you can&apos;t make a decision on how to end the war in Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The president also announced that he had spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and rescheduled his visit to Riyadh for Mar. 10. In a Feb. 17 interview with German media network ARD, Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal and reaffirmed that Ukraine would not accept an agreement brokered without its participation. It remains unclear to what extent Ukraine will be involved in future discussions between Washington and Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-postpones-saudi-arabia-visit-amid-russia-us-talks/	2025-02-18T07:23:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Explosions hit Russian shadow fleet oil tanker in Italy	Two explosions took place on the oil tanker Seajewel, moored in the Italian city of Savona on Feb. 18, with the vessel allegedly transporting Russian oil to Europe, Italian publication IVG reported. The cause of the blasts remains unknown, but initial evidence suggests possible sabotage, including damage below the waterline and a fish kill near the tanker. The Seajewel, part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to evade sanctions, had previously loaded oil in Russia three times in 2024, according to Ukrainian Pravda (UP). The crew reported hearing two loud bangs, and the tanker&apos;s hull showed concave damage, indicating the possible placement of explosive devices. UP revealed that the tanker had recently unloaded in the Romanian port of Constanta after arriving from Turkey and was reportedly heading to Novorossiysk, Russia, for reloading. The Savona Coast Guard is investigating the incident with divers, though no further details have been released. Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; consists of aging tankers used to circumvent sanctions, including those imposed by the EU, U.K., and U.S. Ukraine recently sanctioned captains of these vessels, targeting Russian and Iranian nationals involved in illicit oil exports. A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as sanctions intensify, disrupting Moscow&apos;s oil export logistics and forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-hit-russian-linked-oil-tanker-in-italy-raising-sabotage-suspicions/	2025-02-18T07:00:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1241200421.jpg
A ceasefire in Ukraine could end martial law — what would lifting restrictions mean?	For nearly three years, all of Ukraine has been living under martial law. The introduction of martial law temporarily suspended some civilian rights and freedoms and gave the government additional emergency powers in order to fight off Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Mandatory curfews keep people off the streets at night. Elections are suspended until martial law ends. Military-aged men are restricted from leaving the country unless granted an exception. Financial caps prevent most money from leaving Ukraine. If the current peace negotiations end in a ceasefire, Ukraine will soon face the question of how and when to lift its martial law restrictions. The process requires a delicate balancing act. If lifted right away, it could mean an outflow of money and men that may compromise Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to fend off further attacks if a peace agreement falls apart. Fedir Venislavskyim, a member of parliament&#x2019;s Defense Committee and of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s ruling party, said on Feb. 17 that he &#x201C;does not think martial law can be lifted&#x201D; on just the basis of a ceasefire without additional security guarantees. A ceasefire &#x201C;does not mean that Russia has withdrawn its troops from occupied territories or its means of attack that can strike Ukraine,&#x201D; Venislavskyim said. &#x201C;Given Putin&#x2019;s mental state, I think we can expect any possible developments. Therefore, without guarantees that this will lead to a lasting peace, I do not think martial law can be lifted,&#x201D; he added. Here&#x2019;s what you need to know about the restrictions currently in place and what lifting them could look like. Martial law is a special legal status that introduces military rule, typically imposed in situations of war or other extreme emergencies. The exact specifics depend on the country imposing it. In Ukraine, people&apos;s rights and limitations under martial law are determined by Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution and a series of laws passed by parliament. Three key aspects of martial law are the complete suspension of all elections, restrictions on military-aged men traveling abroad with some exceptions, and a mandatory curfew imposed across the country. Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are all explicitly banned by the Martial Law Act. If not for the war, parliamentary elections would have been held in 2023, and President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s term would have ended in May of 2024. Their terms have instead continued. Carrying out elections during the war would require ensuring the safety of polling places, and would need to guarantee the participation of soldiers at the front, refugees abroad, internally displaced civilians, and Ukrainians living in or closest to the fighting.

Ukraine has also banned almost all travel abroad for men between the ages of 18 and 60, except with special permission in cases like medical emergencies, business trips, international sports events, or cross-border transportation of humanitarian goods. Nighttime curfews are in place, requiring everyone to stay inside and off the streets unless issued a special pass. In Kyiv and many major cities, curfew lasts from midnight until 5 a.m. though curfew varies from region to region and typically lasts longer closer to the fighting. Except for overnight trains, public transport is suspended during curfew. Because workers and patrons need to be inside before curfew, commercial establishments close well in advance of the curfew hour. These are only a few of the relevant aspects of martial law &#x2014; the provisions extend far beyond these situations and touch many aspects of Ukrainian life. For example, public holidays are converted from days off to working holidays, sending money out of the country is restricted, and property can be seized for the needs of the state if reimbursed. The European Commission consistently has assessed that Ukraine&#x2019;s martial law has been proportionate overall given the security situation. Ukraine&#x2019;s martial law has been in place without any interruptions since Feb. 24, 2022, the first day of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The same evening of the invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree approved by parliament to introduce martial law for a period of 30 days to &#x201C;ensure Ukraine&apos;s defense, public safety and state interests.&#x201D; More than a dozen decrees extending martial law have been signed since then &#x2014; first as 30-day extensions, but now extending it for 90 days at a time. Bills to extend martial law are among those gathering the broadest support across the political spectrum and pass easily. The most recent extension was signed earlier this month and will last until May 9. While this period has been Ukraine&#x2019;s most widespread and lengthiest period of martial law in modern history, it&#x2019;s not the country&#x2019;s first. Former President Petro Poroshenko temporarily imposed martial law in 2018, following the Kerch Strait Incident, in which Russian ships opened fire at three Ukrainian naval boats crossing the Kerch Strait. It was the first time that Russian forces attacked Ukraine openly while identifying themselves as Russian, rather than hiding behind proxy forces. In that case, martial law was only applied to limited regions in the east and was not renewed after the 30-day period expired. A ceasefire alone is unlikely to convince Ukrainian officials to end martial law, and it won&#x2019;t trigger an end automatically. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will need to decide whether it is safe to lift martial law and then choose not to extend it when it expires or vote to lift it. The exact timing and structure of martial law&#x2019;s end will depend on the outcome of the ongoing peace negotiations, including Ukraine&#x2019;s confidence in whether Russia is likely to attack again. When restrictions lift, there will likely be a rapid outflow of people and money that were previously barred from leaving the country.

(Michael Sorrow / Anadolu via Getty Images)Around a fifth of Ukrainians say they would want to move abroad if travel restrictions were lifted, according to a poll published last month by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center. Those numbers were higher for men and young people &#x2014; with a quarter of men and a third of Ukrainians between the ages of 18 and 29 saying they would want to move. Such a substantial outflow would significantly weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s military readiness if the ceasefire is violated and hostilities resume. Separately, a sudden complete lifting could destabilize the country in other ways, like aggravating the current labor shortage. One potential arrangement could be Ukraine gradually easing restrictions overtime after a ceasefire is reached and security guarantees are in place.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-could-bring-an-end-to-martial-law-what-restrictions-have-been-in-place-and-what-would-their-end-mean/	2025-02-18T06:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2105335422.jpg
North Korea gaining military experience in Ukraine, improving its missiles' accuracy, Budanov says	North Korea is participating in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview South Korean news outlet The Chosun published on Feb. 17. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. &quot;Despite heavy casualties, North Korean forces remain actively engaged in joint operations with Russian troops,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;This war has mobilized the full military capabilities of the nations involved. Only three countries &#x2014; Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea &#x2014; are gaining direct experience in full-scale 21st-century warfare. The North Korean military of the future will be fundamentally different from its past,&quot; Budanov added. The number of North Korean artillery on the battlefield has increased, and North Korean missiles have become more precise, according to Budanov. &quot;Initially, their accuracy was severely flawed, with an error margin of 500 to 1,500 meters,&quot; he said. &quot;But Russian missile experts made technical modifications, resolving the issue. The missile is now significantly more precise and a far greater threat.&quot; &quot;North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;This will have lasting consequences for the security landscape in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past three years, particularly in the context of geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. In the fall of 2024, Russia and North Korea ratified a strategic partnership agreement which includes the development of trade, scientific, technical, and defense cooperation. However, the agreement did not mention the treatment of wounded Russian soldiers. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014; including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014; to sending soldiers. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-gaining-military-experience-in-ukraine-improving-its-missiles-accuracy-budanov-says/	2025-02-18T05:47:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1733350996.jpeg
We agreed to consider each other's interests' — Russian negotiator Ushakov on talks in Saudi Arabia	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A member of Russia&apos;s delegation that met with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine has said the talks were &quot;not bad,&quot; but it was &quot;hard to say&quot; if the two sides&apos; interests were converging. Speaking to the pro-Kremlin Channel One Russia, Yuri Ushakov, an advisor to Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin, said it was a &quot;very serious discussion of all the issues we wanted to touch upon.&quot; &quot;We have agreed to take account of each other&apos;s interests and develop bilateral relations, since both Moscow and Washington are interested in this,&quot; he added. Ushakov also said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin were discussed, but it was unlikely to take place next week as had been previously speculated.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-agreed-to-consider-each-others-interests-russian-negotiator-ushakov-on-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-18T04:41:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199687527.jpg
Putin ready for talks with Zelensky, Kremlin says, repeats false 'legitimacy' claims	Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin is ready for talks with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 18 in an interview with Russian news agency Interfax. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law. &quot;Putin himself has repeatedly said he would be ready to negotiate with Zelensky if necessary. At the same time, the legal fixation of the agreements is subject to serious discussion, considering the reality,&quot; Peskov said. When asked about a potential meeting between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Peskov said he did not know when it would occur. &quot;No, there is no such understanding, but perhaps there will be some attempts based on the results of today&apos;s talks (in Riyadh). But we will find out about it later, after the end of this dialog,&quot; he said. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Earlier, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. On Feb. 18, U.S. and Russian officials began talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is meeting a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-for-talks-with-zelensky-but-his-legitimacy-to-be-considered-kremlin-says/	2025-02-18T04:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166726414.jpg
Europe at 'kids' table' in talks on Ukraine, Rheinmetall chief says	European countries have found themselves at &quot;a separate kids&apos; table&quot; in the negotiations on Ukraine because of insufficient investment in their defense, Armin Papperger, chief executive of Rheinmetall, said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 18. Papperger&apos;s comments come as Russia and the U.S. began talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, previously said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. &quot;If you don&apos;t invest, if you&apos;re not strong, they handle you like kids,&quot; Papperger said, adding that over the past 30 years, Europe has considered it acceptable to invest about 1% of GDP in defense. As a result of insufficient investment in defense, Europe is now perceived as a child who must sit at a separate table while adults negotiate over Ukraine&apos;s future, according to Papperger. &quot;If parents have dinner, the kids have to sit at another table,&quot; he said. &quot;The U.S. is negotiating with Russia, and no European is at the table &#x2014; it has become very clear that the Europeans are the kids.&quot; Papperger doubted that Trump&apos;s peace talks will really lead to Russia &quot;stopping firing.&quot; He also said that his company would benefit even if there was a ceasefire because Europe would continue to invest in armaments as it confronted the threat of potential Russian aggression. Rheinmetall is one of the largest arms manufacturers in Europe. The company provides weapons, ammunition, and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. Rheinmetall also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024, the first of four plants it plans to open in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-has-found-itself-at-separate-table-for-kids-in-talks-on-ukraine-rheinmetall-chief-says/	2025-02-18T03:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
New video shows Australian POW Oscar Jenkins alive but injured in Russian captivity	An Australian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine has appeared in a video uploaded to YouTube on Feb. 8, alive but injured. In the video, a man identifies himself as 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins who went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast. A man behind the camera says the date at the time of filming is Jan. 17, around the same time reports circulated that Jenkins had been executed by his Russian captors. Jenkins says he feels &quot;weak&quot; and has &quot;lost a lot of weight,&quot; and that he has a broken arm. He is then asked to confirm that reports about his death are untrue. &quot;Correct,&quot; he replies. Jenkins was serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Unverified reports began circulating in mid-January that the soldier was executed by his Russian captors, prompting Australian officials to make urgent inquiries to Russia about his whereabouts. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Jan. 29 that Jenkins was alive but that &quot;we still hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins as a prisoner of war,&quot; Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as &quot;much loved&quot; by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-video-shows-australian-pow-oscar-jenkins-alive-but-injured-in-russian-captivity/	2025-02-18T02:58:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins.png
Now is a critical moment' — EU chief von der Leyen meets Kellogg to discuss Ukraine	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg in Brussels on Feb. 18, to discuss ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The meeting comes on the same day that Russia and the U.S. began talks in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is not participating in the talks, but President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to arrive in the country in the coming days for an official visit. &quot;Financially and militarily, Europe has brought more to the table than anyone else. And we will step up. We want to partner with the U.S. to deliver a just and lasting peace for Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen wrote on X. &quot;Now is a critical moment,&quot; she added. Important discussion with @generalkellogg on Ukraine.Financially and militarily, Europe has brought more to the table than anyone else. And we will step up.We want to partner with the US to deliver a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.Now is a critical moment. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. European leaders held an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17, reflecting growing European concerns that Trump and Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19 to focus on diplomatic and military support and potential pathways to peace. Kellogg did not confirm whether he would visit the front lines, as President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested.	https://kyivindependent.com/now-is-a-critical-moment-eu-chief-von-der-leyen-meets-kellogg-to-discuss-ukraine/	2025-02-18T02:23:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1662120631.jpg
Alternatives to Trump's Russia appeasement	U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to bring peace to Ukraine. But his approach cannot work, because it fails to address the problem of security guarantees. There will be no peace as long as Ukraine must face Russia on its own. But perhaps this flaw can be overcome. In theory, technical innovation in the miniaturization of warfare might offer new ways of ensuring peace, and France and the United Kingdom &#x2014; both nuclear powers &#x2014; could step in as America steps back. Now is the time to consider such possibilities. Speaking at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels last week, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appears to have just surrendered many of the key elements that would have been subject to negotiations. Before talks have even begun, the U.S. says it will impose territorial losses on Ukraine and bar it from joining NATO. Worse, these comments were immediately followed by a euphoric social media post from Trump about a conversation he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin. With both parties in the war near exhaustion, it is not foolish to explore the options for achieving a lasting peace in the absence of complete capitulation by one side. But the path Trump has chosen leads directly into an impossible thicket. A lasting and credible solution requires removing the cause of war. But what is that cause? For Ukrainians, it is Putin&#x2019;s decision to launch a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Removing the cause thus would require a change in the Russian government &#x2014; an unlikely outcome. For Putin, the cause is what he sees as an illegitimate government in Ukraine. Indeed, as he made clear in a wide-ranging essay published in July 2021, he denies the legitimacy of Ukrainian independence itself. Removing the cause thus would require eliminating Ukraine as a sovereign nation-state. History is full of ironies, and the latest flurry of peace initiatives comes just before the Munich Security Conference, a meeting held a few hundred yards away from the site of the most notorious failed peacemaking attempt in modern history. It was there, in 1938, that Adolf Hitler managed to convince Britain and France that Czechoslovakia, not Nazi Germany, was the cause of conflict on the continent. After a month of crisis diplomacy, the British, French, and Italian leaders met Hitler at the F&#xFC;hrerbau (&#x201C;the F&#xFC;hrer&apos;s building&#x201D;) in Munich and imposed a political settlement on Czechoslovakia, stripping it of the so-called Sudetenland, a western region with a substantial German-speaking minority that had been radicalized by Nazi propaganda. Although peace agreements are often driven by a revulsion to the horrors of war, they also often set the stage for new conflicts. In a Sept. 27, 1938 radio address to the British people, U.K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain reflected on, &#x201C;How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.&#x201D; Within a year, Britons were putting on gas masks and building defenses. Then-U.K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain waves to the crowd at Heston Airport after returning from signing the Munich Agreement, proclaiming &quot;Peace in our time,&quot; in London, England, in September 1938. (Hulton-Deutsch Collection / Corbis via Getty Images)Meanwhile, in France, the argument for peace (appeasement) in 1938 and 1939 was distilled in the question: &#x201C;Mourir pour Dantzig?&#x201D; (&#x201C;To die for Gdansk?&#x201D;). But those who believed they had kept themselves safe through clever diplomacy were soon dying for France. The language of failed peacemaking follows a familiar pattern. First, we are told that the big boys will handle it by sidelining bothersome smaller countries with their complicated histories. As Trump said of his conversation with Putin, &#x201C;We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations.&#x201D; The big European powers exhibited the same arrogance in 1938. Second, we are told that simple logic will suffice. Or as Trump put it, &#x201C;President Putin even used my very strong campaign motto of, &#x2018;common sense.&#x2019;&#x201D; It was also common sense that the Sudeten question, not Hitler&#x2019;s desire to unite Europe under Nazi rule, was at the heart of the 1938 crisis. Third, the peacemongers invoke the threat of civilizational collapse. Russia has consistently threatened nuclear war, and similar fears of escalation shaped British decision-making in the late 1930s. &#x201C;The real triumph,&#x201D; Chamberlain told the House of Commons on Oct. 3, 1938, &#x201C;is that... representatives of four great Powers can find it possible to agree on a way of carrying out a difficult and delicate operation by discussion instead of by force of arms, and thereby they have averted a catastrophe which would have ended civilization as we have known it.&#x201D; Likewise, effective deterrence is the key to ensuring that the conflict in Ukraine remains truly frozen, and that Russia does not just use the freeze to build up its military capacity until it can apply irresistible force. During the Cold War, such deterrence was achieved with the threat of mutual assured destruction. The same mechanism could offer a way out now. It could be applied by France and the U.K., which, along with the U.S. and Russia, are parties to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, whereby Ukraine agreed to give up more than 1,700 Soviet-era nuclear weapons in exchange for the other parties&#x2019; promise to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. Either France or the U.K. &#x2014; or preferably both &#x2014; could supply nuclear weapons to Ukraine and any other vulnerable targets of Russian aggression. Had Britain and France been capable of arming Czechoslovakia effectively in 1938, there would have been no German invasion, and maybe no World War II. But this simply wasn&#x2019;t possible at the time. Today is different. France and Britain do possess the means of deterrence, and technological transfers are much easier. There has long been talk of finding a new form of multilateralism in a world that is becoming more fragmented and multipolar. France and Britain have a chance to show how this might work, and how it could restore some peace and security to a world that is tottering on the edge of the abyss.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 26 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two and injured 26 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 18. Russian forces launched 176 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, Primosk-Akhtarsk, and Russian-occupied Crimea at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 103 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Vinnytsia, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 67 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another was injured in the city of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In the village of Illinivka, one person suffered injuries, while in the town of Kostiantynivka, one civilian, two rescuers, and two police officers were injured. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, an 80-year-old man was killed in an artillery attack against the town of Orikhiv. His body was pulled from the rubble, the local military administration reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, eight people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces attacked the Nikopol district with drones and artillery, targeting the Chervonohryhoriv community and the town of Nikopol. The attacks resulted in seven injured civilians, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. In Kharkiv Oblast, three men, aged 23, 49, and 50, suffered injuries after the Russian strike with an FPV (first-person-view) drone in the village of Kutkivka. Another FPV drone strike injured a 38-year-old man in the village of Prystin, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Sumy Oblast, Russia carried out several strikes with FPV drones, injuring one person in the Myropillia community, according to the local military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-26-over-past-day/	2025-02-18T01:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-18-11_15_09.jpeg
Europe is ready and willing to step up' — Rutte on security guarantees for Ukraine	Europe is ready and willing to take a leadership role in providing Ukraine with security guarantees, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wrote on Feb. 17 on X.

US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia begin	U.S. and Russian officials on Feb. 18 began talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is meeting a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, the first official face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Though the U.S. and Russia are meeting without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal from the Trump administration during a wide-ranging interview with German media network ARD published Feb. 17, reaffirming that Ukraine would not accept a peace deal negotiated without the country&apos;s involvement. &quot;Everything that Russia and the U.S. can agree on &#x2013; if they even want to agree on something &#x2013; concerns their bilateral relations. They certainly cannot negotiate about our people and our lives. About an end to the war without us,&quot; Zelensky told ARD. After an emergency summit of European leaders in Paris on Feb. 17, French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. The Paris summit, convened by Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. &quot;We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said. &quot;To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians.&quot; He stressed that without such measures, any ceasefire could be short-lived and ineffective.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia-begin/	2025-02-17T23:51:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199658460.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 861,090 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 861,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 18. This number includes 1,170 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,101 tanks, 21,075 armored fighting vehicles, 37,679 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,275 artillery systems, 1,285 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,068 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 25,586 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-861-090-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-17T22:40:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1832663506.jpg
Ukrainian draft officer injured during violent attack in Lviv Oblast	A Ukrainian draft officer was injured in a violently attack on Feb. 17 in the city of Zhovkva in Lviv Oblast while escorting two mobilized individuals to a medical evaluation. The unnamed officer was attacked around 11:45 a.m. local time by two unidentified individuals. The officer suffered lacerations after being cut by an unknown sharp object, the Lviv Oblast Territorial Recruitment Center said. The suspects in the case fled the scene and is currently at large. No information was immediately available as to the status of the injured officer. Investigators, who opened a criminal investigation into the matter, believe that the likely motive was to help one of the escorted conscripts escape the draft officer. The incident follows a series of recent attacks against military enlistment officers. Last week, a Ukrainian Armed Forces service member was injured in a violent attack at a military enlistment office in Kharkiv on Feb. 12. In another recent incident, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) revealed that Russia recruited the perpetrator of an explosion at a draft office in Rivne on Feb. 1 that injured eight service members and killed the suspected bomber. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv faces challenges in mobilizing troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-draft-officer-attacked-in-lviv-oblast/	2025-02-17T21:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2105335403.jpg
Media investigation identifies over 93,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 93,641 Russian soldiers who have been killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in late-January, the names of 2,582 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The confirmed death toll now includes 22,000 volunteers, 15,600 recruited prisoners, and 10,700 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 4,700 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed. The media also revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. The journalists note that at least 12,000 Russian soldiers are missing amid the war. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference that almost 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war, including nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official let slip in December that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16, Zelensky said over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 380,000 injured on the battlefield. As of Feb. 17, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-investigation-identifies-over-93-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-02-17T20:51:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Ukraine wins 30 medals at Invictus Games	Team Ukraine secured a total of 30 medals during the 2025 Invictus Games, including 12 gold, 12 silver, and six bronze medal finishes. The international sporting event, held in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, ran from Feb. 8 to 17 and featured 35 injured Ukrainian soldiers &#x2014; the largest Ukrainian delegation to participate in the games. Ukraine&apos;s total medal count marks the country&apos;s second best result at the Invictus Games, with the country finishing in fourth place overall in terms of medal count. Ukraine has participated in the Invictus Games since 2017, winning a record 34 medals in the last competition in 2023. The United States placed first with 55 medals in total. Ukraine&apos;s top athlete, Ukrainian Armed Forces Servicemember Ihor Oliinyk won a total of six medals, including three gold and three silver in various swimming events. This year&#x2019;s games featured 550 athletes with disabilities, injuries, and illnesses from 25 different countries, competing across 11 sports, from Alpine skiing to swimming. The Invictus Games, created in 2014 by Prince Harry, has sought to create a community for service members, bringing people together through the games themselves and creating a larger network of service members who have lived through the experience of war. The Economist estimates that nearly 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured and are unable to return to the front line. After coming back from the battlefield or captivity, soldiers are often left to deal with their physical and mental trauma alone. As of July 2024, there are 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine, of whom nearly 80% are mobilized, Suspilne reported, citing the Veterans Affairs Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wins-30-medals-at-invictus-games/	2025-02-17T19:58:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2200119860-612x612.jpg
Over 10,000 applications to join military submitted by young recruits following introduction of 'special contracts,' Defense Ministry says	Ukraine&apos;s military has received over 10,000 applications from volunteer recruits aged 18 to 24 following the introduction of lucrative &quot;special contracts,&quot; Defense Ministry Spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said on Ukrainian TV on Feb. 17. The contracts, aimed at recruiting additional military personnel who are not subject to mobilization, provide a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies have continuously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with President Volodymyr Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. A one-year contract option would likely appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-10-000-applications-to-join-military-received-from-young-recruits-following-introduction-of-special-contracts-defense-ministry-says/	2025-02-17T19:04:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2145253264.jpg
US is saying things that are very pleasant for Putin' — Zelensky warns against peace deal without Ukraine's participation ahead of US-Russia meeting	President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against a hastily negotiated peace deal from the Trump administration during a wide-ranging interview with German media network ARD published Feb. 17, reaffirming that Ukraine would not accept a peace deal negotiated without the country&apos;s involvement. &quot;Everything that Russia and the U.S. can agree on &#x2013; if they even want to agree on something &#x2013; concerns their bilateral relations. They certainly cannot negotiate about our people and our lives. About an end to the war without us,&quot; Zelensky told ARD. Zelensky&apos;s comments come ahead of an anticipated meeting on Feb. 18 between a U.S. and Russian delegation as negotiations about how to end the war in Ukraine begin. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;Ukraine knew nothing about it. And Ukraine considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine (as such) to be futile,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing in the United Arab Emirates. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. During his interview, Zelensky also warned against a peace plan that included unfavorable terms for Ukraine, emphasizing that Ukraine &quot;will not give up&quot; its land in a permanent ceasefire. Zelensky rebuked comments made by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 12 that Ukraine is unlikely to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. &quot;The U.S. is saying things today that are very pleasant for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I think that is the crux of the matter. Because they want to please him. Do you know why? To meet each other and to have a quick success,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Hegseth &quot;should delve deeper into the details&quot; and that &quot;he needs time for that.&quot; &quot;Of course, we will reclaim everything. Respect for international law will return &#x2014; if not today, then tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky concluded, noting that ceasefire negotiations must include security guarantees from the United States. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. European leaders held an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-is-saying-things-that-are-very-pleasant-for-putin-zelensky-says-ahead-of-us-russia-meeting/	2025-02-17T18:16:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Macron pushes for strong security guarantees for Ukraine after talks with Trump, Zelensky	French President Emmanuel Macron has reaffirmed the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, warning that a ceasefire without them risks collapsing like the failed Minsk agreements. His Feb. 17 statement came after urgent talks with European leaders, followed by separate calls with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Paris summit, convened by Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. &quot;We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said. &quot;To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians.&quot; He stressed that without such measures, any ceasefire could be short-lived and ineffective. Macron emphasized Europe&#x2019;s responsibility to strengthen its own security: &quot;Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense&#x2014;both for today and for the future,&quot; he said in his statement on X. Macron also underscored the importance of close coordination with the U.S. and Ukraine in shaping a sustainable security framework. &quot;We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,&quot; he said. French president&apos;s comments reflect growing European concerns about Trump&#x2019;s approach to negotiations with Russia and the potential for a U.S.-brokered deal that does not fully account for Ukrainian and European security needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-pushes-for-strong-security-guarantees-for-ukraine-after-talks-with-trump-zelensky/	2025-02-17T16:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
Starmer urges US support for European peacekeeping force in Ukraine	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to provide American military backing for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression. His appeal came after an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17, where European leaders debated increasing defense spending and discussed the potential deployment of European forces, according to the Guardian. Starmer reiterated his willingness to send British troops as part of a multinational force but insisted that U.S. involvement was essential to ensure its effectiveness. The Paris summit, convened by French President Emmanuel Macron on short notice, reflected growing European concerns that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin may be negotiating over European security without the direct involvement of European leaders. While some leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, opposed discussions on deploying a European force, Starmer pushed forward, arguing that European troops would need American logistical and military support. U.K. defense officials have stressed that even a non-combat peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops would require NATO&#x2019;s protection, particularly in terms of air cover and logistics. Scholz, while agreeing that a European force could not operate without U.S. backing, dismissed the timing of the debate as premature. He criticized discussions about troop deployment while Russia continues its war in Ukraine, arguing that the focus should remain on military and financial support for Kyiv. Other European leaders, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, emphasized the urgent need to boost European defense spending to counter Russia&#x2019;s military power. Tusk warned that unless European countries take immediate steps to strengthen their defenses, they will struggle to provide meaningful support for Ukraine. If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defence now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don&#x2019;t prevent a wider war. As the Polish PM I&#x2019;m entitled to say it loud and clear, since Poland already spends almost 5% of its GDP on defence. And we will continue to do so. Concerns over Trump&#x2019;s potential approach to peace negotiations with Russia dominated the summit, as European leaders fear he may push for a ceasefire that does not account for Ukrainian interests. Senior U.S. and Russian diplomats are set to meet in Riyadh to follow up on a phone call Trump initiated with Putin last week. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments, adding that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. European diplomats are increasingly worried that Trump might make unilateral concessions to Russia, such as lifting key sanctions or withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, as part of a broader deal with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-urges-us-support-for-european-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2025-02-17T14:54:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177726362.jpg
US envoy Kellogg to visit Ukraine on Feb. 19	U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will arrive in Ukraine on Feb. 19, traveling by overnight train from Poland. His visit will last three days, though the schedule is still being finalized. Speaking to journalists in Brussels on Feb. 17, Kellogg confirmed his travel plans, saying he would first head to Warsaw on Tuesday before taking a night train to Kyiv. &quot;I&#x2019;m taking the train tomorrow night and will be there (in Kyiv) on Wednesday morning,&quot; he said in response to a question from Interfax-Ukraine. His meetings with Ukrainian officials are expected to focus on diplomatic and military support and potential pathways to peace. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes at a critical time as the U.S. intensifies efforts to help end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. However, concerns are mounting in Kyiv and European capitals that they may be sidelined from crucial negotiations, potentially jeopardizing their interests and long-term regional security. Kellogg did not confirm whether he would visit the front lines, as President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested. &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 17. Kellogg added that his itinerary remains under discussion but confirmed meetings with Ukrainian officials. &quot;Regarding my trip to Ukraine, it is still being finalized. Will I go? Yes. Will I meet with President Zelensky? Yes,&quot; he said. Speaking during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, Kellogg stressed that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;When you say concessions, of course, they&apos;re concessions that both sides are going to have to give,&quot; Kellogg said, without specifying what concessions the countries would have to make. &quot;If you think you&apos;re going to kill your way out of this, you&apos;re wrong because you have a lousy view of history,&quot; Kellogg continued, noting that Russia was &quot;willing to sacrifice&quot; large number of Russian soldiers on the battlefield, invoking memories of the 700,000 Russian soldiers lost in the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-envoy-kellogg-to-visit-ukraine-on-feb-19/	2025-02-17T13:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199092179.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's Lavrov rules out territorial concessions as part of Ukraine peace talks	Key developments on Feb. 17: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 17 said there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions to Ukraine on the eve of talks with the U.S. over how to end Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Russia&apos;s claims to have annexed the four oblasts in their entirety were made despite not controlling all of them, including two regional capitals - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;Territorial concessions to what is now called Ukraine were made by the Soviet leadership during the formation of the USSR,&quot; Lavrov said in comments reported by Reuters. Lavrov also said he saw no role for Europe in negotiations over how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;If they&apos;re going to come up with some crafty ideas about freezing the conflict like this, and they themselves... have in mind the continuation of the war, then why invite them?&quot; he said. Lavrov&apos;s comments came after it was announced that he and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces (SSO) and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky District of Kuban overnight on Feb. 17, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU and SSO of the Armed Forces continued the introduction of &apos;drone sanctions&apos; against two important Russian enterprises that work for the enemy military-industrial complex,&quot; the source said. Residents earlier posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery in the Seversky district of Krasnodar Krai. Around 1:30 a.m. local time, the sounds of explosions were also reported. Negotiations are one thing, but Russian oil refineries won&#x2019;t shut themselves down. In Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region, the Ilsky oil refinery&#x2014;already targeted multiple times&#x2014;was hit again. As always, observers are delighted. pic.twitter.com/JLCvHv1dOE The attack caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, the source said. In February 2024, SBU drones also hit this oil refinery, damaging a primary oil-refining unit worth $50 million, according to the source. Ukrainian drones also hit the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, the largest in Russia&apos;s Caspian Pipeline Consortium. As a result of the attack, the station was taken out of operation. Oil is now being pumped out, bypassing the station, the source added. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. European nations considering deploying troops to Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire monitoring mission could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, the Washington Post reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions come amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has encouraged European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. According to the Post, the estimated troop numbers emerged in response to a U.S. questionnaire sent to European countries asking them to assess their capabilities to support Kyiv. The planned force would not be deployed along the front line but would be positioned to respond swiftly if Russian forces resumed hostilities. France has reportedly conducted the most detailed military planning for such a mission and could commit up to 10,000 troops. The U.K. has also indicated willingness to contribute forces, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaling support for a European-led initiative on Feb. 16. Other European nations remain cautious, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. Countries like Poland and Germany are cautious about making major moves ahead of their upcoming national elections. Some are reportedly hesitant to take risks without increased U.S. involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military. President Volodymyr Zelesnky said on Feb. 17 he hopes the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit the front lines when he visits later this week. In comments reported by Interfax-Ukraine, Zelensky said Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 and could stay for &quot;two days and maybe more.&quot; &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; he added. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid several significant developments in the U.S. push to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for Feb. 18 talks with a U.S. delegation. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days. Ukraine will &quot;never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia&quot; regarding the outcome of peace negotiation without Ukraine&apos;s participation, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky&apos;s comments, which were made during the Munich Security Conference, come amid reports that a U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia for the start of negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have this place at the table at the very beginning, and we are the first who are at this table because the war is in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added, noting that Ukrainians would never accept a peace deal that was negotiated on their behalf. &quot;We are thankful for all the support, unity in the U.S. around Ukraine support - even bipartisan support - we are thankful for all of this, but there is no leader in the world that can make a deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without us, about us.&quot; Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Earlier in the day on Feb. 16, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment on Feb. 17 released footage of what they claim was a successful operation to clear an industrial enterprise behind Russian lines. In a post accompanying the video, the unit said a concentration of enemy troops was spotted by reconnaissance drones in an unidentified area of the front line. Ukrainian troops reportedly held their positions for two days amid &quot;intense fighting,&quot; during which 23 Russian soldiers were killed, with Kyiv&apos;s troops eventually withdrawing without suffering any losses. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with Russian troops.

Russia's Lavrov rules out territorial concessions as part of Ukraine peace talks	Key developments on Feb. 17: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 17 said there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions to Ukraine on the eve of talks with the U.S. over how to end Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Russia&apos;s claims to have annexed the four oblasts in their entirety were made despite not controlling all of them, including two regional capitals - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;Territorial concessions to what is now called Ukraine were made by the Soviet leadership during the formation of the USSR,&quot; Lavrov said in comments reported by Reuters. Lavrov also said he saw no role for Europe in negotiations over how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;If they&apos;re going to come up with some crafty ideas about freezing the conflict like this, and they themselves... have in mind the continuation of the war, then why invite them?&quot; he said. Lavrov&apos;s comments came after it was announced that he and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces (SSO) and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky District of Kuban overnight on Feb. 17, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU and SSO of the Armed Forces continued the introduction of &apos;drone sanctions&apos; against two important Russian enterprises that work for the enemy military-industrial complex,&quot; the source said. Residents earlier posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery in the Seversky district of Krasnodar Krai. Around 1:30 a.m. local time, the sounds of explosions were also reported. Negotiations are one thing, but Russian oil refineries won&#x2019;t shut themselves down. In Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region, the Ilsky oil refinery&#x2014;already targeted multiple times&#x2014;was hit again. As always, observers are delighted. pic.twitter.com/JLCvHv1dOE The attack caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, the source said. In February 2024, SBU drones also hit this oil refinery, damaging a primary oil-refining unit worth $50 million, according to the source. Ukrainian drones also hit the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, the largest in Russia&apos;s Caspian Pipeline Consortium. As a result of the attack, the station was taken out of operation. Oil is now being pumped out, bypassing the station, the source added. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. European nations considering deploying troops to Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire monitoring mission could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, the Washington Post reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions come amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has encouraged European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. According to the Post, the estimated troop numbers emerged in response to a U.S. questionnaire sent to European countries asking them to assess their capabilities to support Kyiv. The planned force would not be deployed along the front line but would be positioned to respond swiftly if Russian forces resumed hostilities. France has reportedly conducted the most detailed military planning for such a mission and could commit up to 10,000 troops. The U.K. has also indicated willingness to contribute forces, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaling support for a European-led initiative on Feb. 16. Other European nations remain cautious, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. Countries like Poland and Germany are cautious about making major moves ahead of their upcoming national elections. Some are reportedly hesitant to take risks without increased U.S. involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military. President Volodymyr Zelesnky said on Feb. 17 he hopes the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit the front lines when he visits later this week. In comments reported by Interfax-Ukraine, Zelensky said Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 and could stay for &quot;two days and maybe more.&quot; &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; he added. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid several significant developments in the U.S. push to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for Feb. 18 talks with a U.S. delegation. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days. Ukraine will &quot;never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia&quot; regarding the outcome of peace negotiation without Ukraine&apos;s participation, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky&apos;s comments, which were made during the Munich Security Conference, come amid reports that a U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia for the start of negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have this place at the table at the very beginning, and we are the first who are at this table because the war is in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added, noting that Ukrainians would never accept a peace deal that was negotiated on their behalf. &quot;We are thankful for all the support, unity in the U.S. around Ukraine support - even bipartisan support - we are thankful for all of this, but there is no leader in the world that can make a deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without us, about us.&quot; Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Earlier in the day on Feb. 16, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment on Feb. 17 released footage of what they claim was a successful operation to clear an industrial enterprise behind Russian lines. In a post accompanying the video, the unit said a concentration of enemy troops was spotted by reconnaissance drones in an unidentified area of the front line. Ukrainian troops reportedly held their positions for two days amid &quot;intense fighting,&quot; during which 23 Russian soldiers were killed, with Kyiv&apos;s troops eventually withdrawing without suffering any losses. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with Russian troops.

Hot phase' of war in Ukraine may 'end soon' with new US leadership, Russian UN envoy says	With the Trump administration now in power in the U.S., there is a chance that the &quot;hot phase&quot; of Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine could soon end, Russian UN Representative Vasily Nebeznya said on Feb. 17 as cited by pro-Kremlin outlet Kommersant. Nebeznya claimed that a ceasefire and freezing hostilities alone would not resolve the conflict, outlining Moscow&apos;s conditions for a settlement. The ambassador&apos;s remarks come ahead of talks between Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, where both sides are expected to discuss ending the war. According to Nebeznya, Ukraine should be a &quot;demilitarized, neutral state&quot; outside any alliances, a position Kyiv rejects, warning that without security guarantees, Russia could launch another invasion. Nebenzya also claimed that Ukraine had &quot;irrevocably lost&quot; Crimea, as well as Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. On the same day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the idea of making territorial concessions to Ukraine. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2022, despite not fully controlling all of them, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin has previously said that any peace talks must be based on Ukrainian forces completely withdrawing from the annexed regions. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that Russia must pull back its troops to the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-un-envoy-says-hot-phase-of-ukraine-invasion-may-soon-end-with-republican-us-leadership/	2025-02-17T11:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159683499.jpg
Ukraine calls for Europe to appoint high-level negotiator for US, Russia peace talks	Ukraine has called on European countries to appoint a high-level representative for potential negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 17, citing Presidential Office Deputy Head Ihor Zhovkva. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks but that its interests would be considered. Zhovkva stressed the urgency of appointing a European representative, saying, &quot;It should be a quickly made decision. I hope right after the Paris meeting. We should act, not reflect.&quot; The official did not name potential candidates but said the person should hold a leader-level position to match the status of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky, speaking in the United Arab Emirates, also backed the idea, emphasizing that Europe should have its own representative to ensure its voice is heard in negotiations. European leaders are gathering in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. At the Munich Security Conference, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic called for the EU to appoint a special envoy to avoid being sidelined from talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calls-for-europe-to-appoint-high-level-negotiator-for-us-russia-peace-talks/	2025-02-17T10:30:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1400436478.jpeg
An expert's guide to US-Russia Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia	After years of political isolation sparked by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss how to bring an end to the war. Neither Ukraine nor Europe has been invited to the main discussion, setting off alarm bells in Kyiv and capitals across the continent that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could reach an agreement without Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s involvement, and one that puts their future security in jeopardy. Announcing that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would lead their delegation, the Kremlin set an ambitious agenda for the talks. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Though the U.S. and Russia will meet without Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky will also head to Saudi Arabia this week. NBC reported that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. Meanwhile, such is the sense of urgency in Europe over the course of events: European leaders are gathering in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit. So what should we expect from the historic meeting in Saudi Arabia and is the direction of peace negotiations as alarming as many believe? The Kyiv Independent asked Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, for his thoughts. The Kyiv Independent: There has been a lot of panic in Ukraine and Europe about the possibility of the U.S. and Russia negotiating a peace agreement over their heads &#x2014; is this justified? Ambassador Kurt Volker: &#xA0;People were upset about (being excluded from the table) and I have to keep telling people there isn&apos;t a table. There is (U.S.) President Trump picking up the phone, calling Putin, calling Zelensky, people having meetings at NATO, people having meetings in Munich. It&apos;s going to be like that. It&apos;s going to be a lot of consultation, a lot of conversations, but there&apos;s no single negotiation going on. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) looks at U.S. President Donald Trump during the welcoming ceremony before the G20 Summit&apos;s Plenary Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Nov. 30, 2018. (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)In fact, we don&apos;t even know if it&apos;s going to be possible with Russia. I think there are several things going on and a lot of it is being misread, but there are some things to be watching as well. First off, as we knew, President Trump was going to reach out to Putin in order to try to urge him to end the war, and he&apos;s followed that up now by sending a team to meet with the Russians in Saudi Arabia. I think there was a lot of media excitement over different comments that different people said in the past week, and I think some of them were maybe just not careful enough and the media ran with it. For example, when (U.S. Defense Secretary) Pete Hedgeseth at the NATO meeting said that it&apos;s not realistic for Ukraine to take its territory back (to the 2014 borders), that&apos;s not that different from what President Zelensky was saying in January about not being able to take the territory back militarily, but having to pursue that by other means, provided there were security guarantees for the rest of Ukraine. That&apos;s not that different. Similarly with NATO, (Trump) said it&apos;s not realistic to think that NATO membership would be a result of these negotiations, which I think is absolutely right, because Russia would not agree to that, and we shouldn&apos;t even be talking to Russia about that. That&apos;s none of their business. I think those comments were blown out of proportion a bit. The Kyiv Independent: The meeting between the U.S. and Russia has been talked about as if it&apos;s the first stage of negotiations, but is it perhaps more the U.S. testing the waters and seeing what Russia has to offer and how receptive they might be to things? Ambassador Kurt Volker: It&#x2019;s a great question because I know what Russia&apos;s going to do. Russia&apos;s going to show up and put out all of these issues about a global strategic agenda and all these things that they want, and try to blur the picture as much as possible. And I would hope that what the U.S. will do is put all that to one side and say &apos;Yeah, we can get there, but first you have to stop the war in Ukraine. Stop the fighting and then we can talk about if there&apos;s any scope for other things.&#x2019; I hope they have the clarity to do that, but I&apos;m not sure where they are right now. They may just be in listening mode to say &apos;Okay, what is it that Russia is saying and is there scope for ending the war, and is anything they&apos;re talking about reasonable or of interest to the U.S.?&#x2019; They may just be in listening mode and then will come back and report to Trump. It&apos;s really very hard to say at this stage. The Kyiv Independent: What does Europe need to be doing this week? Do they need to assume that the U.S. has stepped out and assume a much bigger role? Or do they need to sit back and wait and see how this week pans out as well? Ambassador Kurt Volker: This is an interesting thing. I&apos;m very glad the Europeans are meeting in Paris and talking about what contributions they can make to a peace settlement in Ukraine, to security guarantees, to perhaps a European troop presence. It&apos;s exactly the kind of thing that they should be doing. It&apos;s a shame that they&apos;re doing it out of anger and fear because they think that Trump is abandoning them. They should be doing it in order to be constructive, to say &apos;We want to see peace and security for Ukraine. Here&apos;s what we can do. Here&apos;s what we want to do to work with the U.S. to bring this about.&apos; So I think they&apos;re getting to this point for some of the wrong reasons. But if they get to that point and actually have a concept of what to do, that would be a good thing. The Kyiv Independent: How concerned should Ukrainians be about the direction things have been heading in recent days? Ambassador Kurt Volker: I don&apos;t think they should overreact or be overly concerned. In fact, I thought that President Zelensky in Munich could have been suggesting things more proactively rather than reacting somewhat bitterly or negatively to the atmosphere in Munich and to President Trump.

(Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty Images)We have strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the Congress. People are already putting forward legislation on how to be able to continue supporting Ukraine militarily through a Lend-Lease program. The dynamics are going to be first seeing whether there&apos;s any scope of possibly ending the war with Russia. And if not, Trump has already said he&apos;s going to increase sanctions and be prepared to increase pressure. So there&apos;s a long way to go. And I wouldn&apos;t overreact in the short term or assume the worst. This is the first time we&apos;ve had any effort and momentum into ending the conflict in three years. We have to see where it goes.	https://kyivindependent.com/an-experts-guide-to-us-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-17T10:24:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1256148982.jpg
Up to 30,000 European troops reportedly could be deployed to monitor Ukraine ceasefire, Washington Post reports	European nations considering deploying troops to Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire monitoring mission could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, the Washington Post reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions come amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has encouraged European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. According to the Post, the estimated troop numbers emerged in response to a U.S. questionnaire sent to European countries asking them to assess their capabilities to support Kyiv. The planned force would not be deployed along the front line but would be positioned to respond swiftly if Russian forces resumed hostilities. France has reportedly conducted the most detailed military planning for such a mission and could commit up to 10,000 troops. The U.K. has also indicated willingness to contribute forces, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaling support for a European-led initiative on Feb. 16. Other European nations remain cautious, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. Countries like Poland and Germany are cautious about making major moves ahead of their upcoming national elections. Some are reportedly hesitant to take risks without increased U.S. involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military.	https://kyivindependent.com/up-to-30-000-european-troops-may-be-reportedly-deployed-to-monitor-ukraine-ceasefire/	2025-02-17T09:53:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1241758892.jpg
Poroshenko claims Zelensky’s office requested parliament votes in exchange for avoiding sanctions	Former President and current lawmaker Petro Poroshenko on Feb. 17 accused the Presidential Office of offering to support his faction&apos;s involvement in drafting legislation on the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) in exchange for avoiding sanctions. President Volodymyr Zelensky approved a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) decision on Feb. 13 to impose indefinite sanctions on several high-profile figures, including Poroshenko. The ex-president denounced the sanctions as unconstitutional and politically motivated. Poroshenko&apos;s faction has opposed a recent bill to purchase two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the KNPP, a move Zelensky called critical for Ukraine&apos;s energy independence. &quot;I was offered that if the faction voted for the bill on the KNPP, I would not have any problems with sanctions,&quot; Poroshenko claimed in an interview with Ukrainian Pravda. Some lawmakers have criticized the deal, calling the reactors outdated and costly. Parliament has faced repeated delays in passing the law, leading Bulgaria to extend the deal&apos;s deadline to March. &quot;I was attacked because we demanded and are now demanding the withdrawal of mandates from the Opposition Platform for Life party and because we demand an end to Russian oil transit through Ukraine,&quot; Poroshenko said. Although Zelensky banned all pro-Kremlin political projects, including the Opposition Platform, in March 2022, the party&apos;s dissolved parliamentary faction left individual lawmakers with their mandates. Poroshenko also accused Zelensky of overstepping his authority with the sanctions and criticized Ukraine&apos;s 2022 anti-oligarch law, which defines oligarchs as individuals with significant media influence, political involvement, and assets exceeding Hr 2.27 billion ($54 million). &quot;Zelensky dreamed maniacally of sanctions,&quot; he said, adding that only a strong response from the Venice Commission had halted the law&apos;s adoption. On Feb. 14, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced criminal proceedings against individuals on the NSDC sanctions list for &quot;serious and especially serious crimes.&quot; Poroshenko was charged with high treason in 2021 for allegedly conspiring with Russian-backed separatists in a coal supply scheme between November 2014 and January 2015, which reportedly generated Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in profits. He has dismissed the charges and sanctions as politically driven.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-claims-political-motive-behind-sanctions-tied-to-khmelnytskyi-reactor-deal/	2025-02-17T08:46:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2055613178.jpg
Expert guide to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chris York speaks with Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, about the upcoming U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia and why he thinks Ukraine should not be overly concerned about U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s first steps toward peace negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/expert-guide-to-us-russia-talks-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-17T08:24:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0343.JPG
Ukraine 'progresses meaningfully' in talks on foreign troop presence, Zelensky says	Ukraine has made progress towards establishing a foreign military contingent on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 17, following his visit to the United Arab Emirates. Zelensky described the development as a concrete step beyond diplomatic discussions, signaling a shift toward tangible international security cooperation. The announcement comes amid growing discussions in the West about deploying peacekeeping forces to Ukraine if a ceasefire agreement with Russia is reached. While the U.S. has ruled out sending troops, Washington has urged European allies to take the lead. The president also said establishing a foreign contingent could be the first step toward creating a unified European armed force. &quot;I believe that this is the first platform for the future creation of such a force &#x2014; the Armed Forces of Europe, such an army that will be able to respond in the sky, on water, on land, with drones in artificial intelligence, as well as in the event of a Russian offensive,&quot; he said. Zelensky clarified that a foreign military presence does not necessarily mean troops stationed on Ukrainian soil but could include air defense systems and weapons to enhance security. &quot;In the issue of the foreign contingent, it is very important not to lose the United States of America in one form or another,&quot; Zelensky added. A group of European countries is reportedly working on a plan to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, reflecting concerns about shifting U.S. security priorities. On Feb. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer indicated Britain&apos;s willingness to contribute troops as part of a European-led initiative, potentially increasing pressure on Germany and other allies to participate. Zelensky first called on Europe to establish its armed forces during a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, citing concerns over the long-term reliability of U.S. support.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-military-contingent-in-ukraine-could-lead-to-unified-european-force-zelensky-says/	2025-02-17T07:58:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Ukraine’s long-awaited weapons tech investment boom is finally kicking off	Ukrainian weapons startups are finally seeing an inflow of funds from Western investors who have long been intrigued by the Ukraine&apos;s defense tech sector but have so far kept their money out of the war-torn country. Financial analysis firm Pitchbook provided the Kyiv Independent with data showing a four-fold rise in foreign venture capital deals in Ukraine-headquartered startups after the market flatlined in 2022 and 2023 following Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The total dollar value remains slim &#x2014; just under $20 million by Pitchfork&#x2019;s accounting, and $40 million according to the Ukrainian government. But with most of these new deals coming in at the end of 2024, a dam may be bursting. The new deals are almost all defense-related. The largest publicly disclosed investment rounds topped out at around $3 million, and include Ukrainian AI drone navigation firm Swarmer, AI disinformation fighters Osavul, and Buntar Aerospace, which makes reconnaissance drones. Russia&#x2019;s invasions in both 2014 and 2022 crippled ascendant Ukrainian economies, including a fast-growing tech sector. After 2022, a whole new generation of Ukrainian defense startups cropped up &#x2014; both to arm Ukraine&#x2019;s military and to bank on a rapidly growing global arms industry for a post-war Ukrainian economy. Western investors have until now been hesitant to hand money over to these Ukrainian firms. But pressure on Europe to expand its military muscle might be changing that. Ukrainian sources also show a significant uptick in recent months. The first seed round for many defense start-ups in Ukraine came from Brave1, a government fund launched in 2023 to link militarized techies with both Ukrainian soldiers and foreign money. Brave1 also keeps tabs on that incoming investment. Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote at the end of October that Brave1 had pulled in $25 million in international investment into Ukrainian military tech firms since the start of 2024. By comparison, 2023 topped out at $5 million. Viktoriia Kovalchuk, a Brave1 spokesperson, told the Kyiv Independent that the $25 million rose to $40 million by the end of 2024, just two months later. Fedorov predicted $100 million over the course of 2025. Investments into Ukrainian tech startups in 2014-2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)The discrepancy with Pitchbook data is at least in part due to Pitchbook limiting its figures to Ukrainian-registered companies. Many Ukrainian defense tech companies use corporate entities in the EU, U.K., or the U.S. for fundraising. Moreover, many Ukrainian defense start-ups are touchy about reporting numbers, leaving many deals in Pitchbook&#x2019;s data registering as $0. For those involved in Ukrainian investing, the trend is palpable. &#x201C;We are getting more and more interest all the time,&#x201D; says Deborah Fairlamb, who runs a U.S.-registered but Ukraine-focused fund, Green Flag VC. &#x201C;There&apos;s been tons of inquiries from governments all over the place.&#x201D; The uptick in foreign money is good news for a literally and metaphorically embattled Ukrainian economy. Foreign investment could fill in for dwindling foreign aid. Even prior to U.S. President Donald Trump slashing USAID, the National Bank of Ukraine noted a serious jump in the outflow of money from Ukraine. The bank wrote that the shift was largely &#x201C;fueled by significantly lower volumes of grants from international partners.&#x201D; Even Fedorov&#x2019;s hoped-for $100 million isn&#x2019;t enough to prop up a national economy. But, aside from helping defend Ukraine, these defense start-ups are hoping to become serious exporters to countries eyeing a truculent Russia with concern. While Silicon Valley remains the spiritual home of the world&#x2019;s venture capital, and Washington commands the largest weapons budget in the world, the new money into Ukraine&#x2019;s defense start-ups doesn&#x2019;t seem to be coming from the U.S. Fairlamb is herself an American national and longtime resident of Ukraine. Green Flag aims squarely at the budding Ukraine military tech world with investments of between $100,000 and $500,000. But newly interested investors reaching out to Green Flag have increasingly come from the European Union. &#x201C;We have seen in the last three months definite interest from European-based (limited partners),&#x201D; Fairlamb explained. Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House has shaken the European Union&#x2019;s confidence in U.S. protection.

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)&#x201C;When Trump was nominated, Europe finally sort of sat up and said, &#x2018;We might need to get our own house in order.&#x2019; Because that was when I saw a notable increase,&#x201D; says Fairlamb. In large part, the reticence of American money is also due to simple geography. &#x201C;I cannot tell you how much VCs like to be able to visit their companies,&#x201D; says Fairlamb. U.S. weapons investment is also focused heavily on companies that can sell to the U.S. Defense Department as soon as possible. &#x201C;Money doesn&#x2019;t chase the products, products chase the money,&#x201D; she said. Many of Ukraine&#x2019;s start-ups advertise their use in active battle as a key selling point. A ceasefire would not, Fairlamb says, smother the newborn market. &#x201D;Ukraine is going to continue to build up its defense ecosystem even after the war ends, because they are never, ever again going to be reliant on the rest of the world to deliver weapons,&#x201D; says Fairlamb.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-long-awaited-weapons-tech-investment-boom-is-finally-kicking-off/	2025-02-17T07:51:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156532377.jpg
Russia close to deal with Syria for post-Assad military presence, Bloomberg reports	Russia is reportedly nearing a deal with Syria to maintain a limited military presence in the country after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 17, citing sources familiar with the matter. Since Assad&apos;s overthrow in December, Russia has begun withdrawing military assets from Syria, raising doubts about its future role in the region. The Kremlin is seeking continued access to the naval base in Tartus and the Khmeimim airbase, which have served as key military footholds in the region. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to bolster Assad&apos;s regime, which used Moscow&apos;s backing, in the form of ground troops and aerial bombardment, to gain the upper hand in the country&apos;s protracted civil war. In exchange for maintaining its military facilities, Moscow may assist Damascus in countering the Islamic State group, which remains active in eastern Syria, according to Bloomberg sources. Russia&apos;s presence could also help balance Turkey&apos;s influence in the country. The reported deal follows the first official phone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syria&apos;s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Feb. 12. Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra suggested earlier this month that Russia&apos;s ability to retain its military bases would depend on what it offers in return. Syria&apos;s new government has reportedly demanded that Moscow hand over Assad and his close aides, Reuters reported on Jan. 28. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new government regarding Russia&apos;s military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter. Western officials have been cautious in their approach to Syria&apos;s new government. EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas warned that while humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts are being scaled up, sanctions could be reinstated if Damascus takes &quot;wrong steps.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-close-to-deal-with-syria-for-post-assad-military-presence-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-17T07:11:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1183207523.jpg
Russia's Lavrov rules out territorial concessions as part of Ukraine peace talks	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 17 said there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions to Ukraine on the eve of talks with the U.S. over how to end Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Russia&apos;s claims to have annexed the four oblasts in their entirety were made despite not controlling all of them, including two regional capitals - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;Territorial concessions to what is now called Ukraine were made by the Soviet leadership during the formation of the USSR,&quot; Lavrov said in comments reported by Reuters. Lavrov&apos;s comments came after it was announced that he and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with a U.S. delegation about how to end the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 17. &quot;They are expected to hold a meeting with their American counterparts on Tuesday, which will focus primarily on restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations,&quot; Peskov said. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Feb. 16 that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-lavrov-rules-out-territorial-concessions-as-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-02-17T06:10:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg
Film 'Rock, Scissors, Paper' about war in Ukraine wins BAFTA award	The film &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; won the Best British Short Film award at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) on Feb. 16. The film was directed by Franz Bohm, a 26-year-old British man of German descent. It stars Ukrainian actors Oleksandr Rudynskyi, Serhii Kalantai, Yurii Radionov, and Oleksandr Yatsenko. The plot is based on real events that happened during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main character is an 18-year-old boy named Ivan, whose father has been working as a surgeon in the shelter since the first days of the Russian invasion. However, information about the shelter reaches the Russian troops. To protect his family and the wounded, Ivan joins the army and goes to the battlefield. When Rudynskyi, who played the main character, received the award, he said he was dedicating it to Yevhen Svitlychnyi, a 29-year-old Ukrainian actor and a soldier who died in the Kharkiv sector of the front line on July 19, 2023. &quot;I dedicate this award to my friend Zhenya (Yevhen) Svitlychnyi, who died in the war five days before the start of filming. And to all those who defend my country and make it independent. Many thanks to BAFTA, and glory to Ukraine!&quot; Rudynskyi said on the stage during the award ceremony. The world premiere of the film took place in 2024 at the Show Me Shorts Film Festival. In 2024, another film about the war in Ukraine, the Ukrainian documentary &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; won an award for best documentary at the British Academy Film Awards. The film was directed by Ukrainian journalist Mstyslav Chernov, who reached Mariupol with two Associated Press colleagues the day the full-scale invasion was launched and remained in the city for 20 days under heavy bombardment.	https://kyivindependent.com/film-rock-scissors-paper-about-war-in-ukraine-wins-bafta-award/	2025-02-17T06:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200037515.jpg
Zelensky to visit Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, Reuters reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will arrive in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, he said during a press briefing in the United Arabic Emirates, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian president&apos;s visit coincides with the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war in Ukraine, which will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zelensky said that Ukraine would not participate in these talks. &quot;Ukraine knew nothing about it. And Ukraine considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine (as such) to be futile,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing in the United Arabic Emirates. &quot;And we cannot recognize anything or any arrangements about us without us. And we will not recognize such an arrangement,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky stressed that his official visit to Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with &quot;the things that are happening in Saudi Arabia at the level of representatives of the U.S. and Russia.&quot; The president added that he would discuss negotiations with Saudi Arabia&apos;s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. On Feb. 16, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine delegations met to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to hold meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov on the exact dates. U.S. President Donald Trump also announced that he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to the war. It remains unclear to what extent Ukraine will be involved in these discussions.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-saudi-arabia-on-feb-18-reuters-reports/	2025-02-17T05:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250849333.jpg
Zelensky hopes Kellogg will visit front lines during trip to Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelesnky said on Feb. 17 he hopes the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit the front lines when he visits later this week. In comments reported by Interfax-Ukraine, Zelensky said Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 20 and could stay for &quot;two days and maybe more.&quot; &quot; I want to go to the front with him, and he will go to the front with me. I don&apos;t think he will refuse,&quot; he added. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid several significant developments in the U.S. push to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov will fly to Saudi Arabia for Feb. 18 talks with a U.S. delegation. The U.S. delegation will be led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together.

Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-hopes-kellogg-will-visit-front-lines-during-trip-to-ukraine/	2025-02-17T04:55:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193307307.jpg
Ukraine calendar: Events to look out for this week	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 17-Feb. 23. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. European leaders will hold an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 to discuss security and Ukraine&#x2019;s peace negotiation in the wake of the alarming (though not surprising) statements by US figures at the Munich Security Conference. The session will include leaders of the main European states, NATO, and the European Council and Commission. It remains unclear whether President Zelensky will be invited. US President Donald Trump and his administration members&#x2019; comments on Ukraine in the past week have acted as a (incredibly belated) wake-up call for European leaders who now appear to be scrambling to maintain any relevance in the negotiations &#x2013; and to define what a post-US security architecture on the continent could look like. Trump&#x2019;s special Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg will visit Kyiv on Feb. 20. He was expected in Kyiv twice before, but never arrived. After meeting with the Ukrainian delegation in Munich, he will head to Brussels then Kyiv, providing a fig leaf for the Trump administration&#x2019;s dismissive stance on the European and Ukrainian roles in peace talks.The main (previously planned) diplomatic event will be the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20-21, with South Africa hosting as the current G20 chair. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced via X, that he will not participate in the meeting (also, he may be in Saudi Arabia), following President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent threat to withdraw financial support from the country.Relations between the U.S. and South Africa have sharply deteriorated since Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on account of what the US government (especially South Africa-born Elon Musk) describes as &#x201C;racist policies&#x201D; &#x2013; notably the land expropriation law &#x2013; towards minority white Afrikaaners (whom they have offered refugee status in the US).On Feb. 23, Germany will hold a snap election with Christian Merz&#x2019;s conservative CDU/CSU leading in polls. The latter have signaled stronger backing for Ukraine, but would need a coalition, likely with Olaf Scholz&#x2019;s SPD (which has been hesitant, wary of &#x201C;escalation&#x201D;; reports suggest this was driven by Scholz himself, though). The far-right and Ukraine-sceptic AfD is on the rise; in total, a third of votes could go to extremist (and anti-Ukraine) parties.For Ukraine, Germany&#x2019;s political instability raises concerns over future aid and military commitments. Although Berlin has allocated &#x20AC;37 bn in support, key weapons like Taurus missiles remain undelivered. The election will determine whether Germany steps into a leadership role or remains mostly reactive.Meanwhile, speculation continues over potential government changes in Ukraine, particularly regarding Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Various sources suggest that his position may be at risk as of this week, amid an open anti-corruption probe and investigation of possible abuse of power.If you have an upcoming event that you would like featured in our newsletter, please get in touch via insights@kyivindependent.com	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calendar-events-to-look-out-for-this-week/	2025-02-17T04:19:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2021278696.jpg
Drone sanctions' — Ukraine strikes Ilsky Oil Refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, SBU source says	Ukrainian drones, operated by the Special Operations Forces (SSO) and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), hit the Ilsky Oil Refinery in Krasnodar Krai and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in the Kavkazsky District of Kuban overnight on Feb. 17, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU and SSO of the Armed Forces continued the introduction of &apos;drone sanctions&apos; against two important Russian enterprises that work for the enemy military-industrial complex,&quot; the source said. Residents earlier posted videos on social media purportedly showing a large blaze at the refinery in the Seversky district of Krasnodar Krai. Around 1:30 a.m. local time, the sounds of explosions were also reported. Negotiations are one thing, but Russian oil refineries won&#x2019;t shut themselves down. In Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region, the Ilsky oil refinery&#x2014;already targeted multiple times&#x2014;was hit again. As always, observers are delighted. pic.twitter.com/JLCvHv1dOE The attack caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, the source said. In February 2024, SBU drones also hit this oil refinery, damaging a primary oil-refining unit worth $50 million, according to the source. Ukrainian drones also hit the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, the largest in Russia&apos;s Caspian Pipeline Consortium. As a result of the attack, the station was taken out of operation. Oil is now being pumped out, bypassing the station, the source added. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hit-oil-refinery-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-largest-oil-pumping-station-of-caspian-pipeline-consortium-sbu-source-says/	2025-02-17T03:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/--------_---_----.png

Macron hosts summit of European powers to discuss plan for Ukraine's 'automatic NATO membership'	French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a Paris summit of European powers on Feb. 17 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership, among other issues, The Guardian reported. The summit will be held on the same day a U.S. delegation arrives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with Russian officials on ending the war in Ukraine. Macron is planning to convene European leaders to demand that the U.S. stop blocking Europe and Kyiv from the negotiation process, The Guardian reported. The Paris meeting will discuss the defense capabilities that Europe could provide to Ukraine to ensure reliable security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;automatic membership in NATO&quot; in the event of Russia&apos;s clear ceasefire violation, the newspaper reported. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will attend the meeting. Italy and Denmark, representing the Baltic and Scandinavian countries, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will also join the summit, the media reported citing undisclosed European diplomatic sources. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in talks between the U.S. and Russia. This will be the first meeting between the two countries at this level in the last two years. European leaders are concerned about the potential imposition of neutrality on Ukraine and joint U.S.-Russian powers&apos; sharing of agreed-upon spheres of influence following the negotiations. The summit will also have to determine how to respond to a U.S. request to clarify whether EU leaders are willing to contribute troops to a stabilization force in the event of a ceasefire, according to The Guardian. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-gathers-summit-of-european-defense-powers-to-discuss-ukraines-automatic-nato-membership/	2025-02-17T02:56:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
23 invaders destroyed' — Ukraine's special forces release video of operation behind Russian lines	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment on Feb. 17 released footage of what they claim was a successful operation to clear an industrial enterprise behind Russian lines. In a post accompanying the video, the unit said a concentration of enemy troops was spotted by reconnaissance drones in an unidentified area of the front line. Ukrainian troops reportedly held their positions for two days amid &quot;intense fighting,&quot; during which 23 Russian soldiers were killed, with Kyiv&apos;s troops eventually withdrawing without suffering any losses. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with Russian troops.

Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces are active on various fronts. Last month its 8th Regiment published a video of a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left.

(Special Operations Forces).Elsewhere, over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count on Feb. 4, claiming that Ukraine had lost over 45,000 soldiers. Nearly 380,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured since the start of the all-out war, Zelensky told NBC. &quot;Ten of thousands&quot; of Ukrainian troops are currently missing in action or being held in Russian captivity, according to the president. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.	https://kyivindependent.com/23-invaders-destroyed-ukraines-special-forces-release-video-of-operation-behind-russian-lines/	2025-02-17T02:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-12_39_28.png
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 8 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three and injured eight civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 17. Russian forces launched 147 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 83 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, &#xA0;Zaporizhzhia, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 59 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense.

Over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since start of Russia's full-scale war, Zelensky says	Over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count on Feb. 4, claiming that Ukraine had lost over 45,000 soldiers. Nearly 380,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured since the start of the all-out war, Zelensky told NBC. &quot;Ten of thousands&quot; of Ukrainian troops are currently missing in action or being held in Russian captivity, according to the president. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official in recent months let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-46-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-start-of-war-zelensky-says/	2025-02-16T23:41:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163893306--1-.jpg

Ukraine will 'never accept' outcome of peace negotiations without Ukraine's participation, Zelensky says	Ukraine will &quot;never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia&quot; regarding the outcome of peace negotiation without Ukraine&apos;s participation, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky&apos;s comments, which were made during the Munich Security Conference, come amid reports that a U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia for the start of negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have this place at the table at the very beginning, and we are the first who are at this table because the war is in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added, noting that Ukrainians would never accept a peace deal that was negotiated on their behalf. &quot;We are thankful for all the support, unity in the U.S. around Ukraine support - even bipartisan support - we are thankful for all of this, but there is no leader in the world that can make a deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without us, about us.&quot; Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Earlier in the day on Feb. 16, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-never-accept-outcome-of-peace-negotiations-without-ukraines-participation-zelensky-says/	2025-02-16T21:09:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai following 'massive' drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire reportedly erupted at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on Feb. 17 following large-scale Ukrainian drone attacks on the region, Russian Telegram media channels reported. Videos posted on social media by local residents purportedly show a large blaze at the refinery located in the Seversky district of the region. Residents reported hearing sounds of explosions around 1:30 a.m. local time. Regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev claimed earlier in the evening that Ukrainian drones carried out a &quot;massive attack&quot; on the region, damaging 12 homes and injuring a woman &#x2014; although Kondratyev made no mention of the attack on the refinery. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Emergency crews are currently on-scene. No information was immediately available as to any casualties at the refinery or the extent of the damage. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. The purported attack follows just days after Ukraine&apos;s military attacked the Afipskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10. The attack targeted the key facility which processes 6.25 million tons of oil annually.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-refinery-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-following-massive-drone-attack/	2025-02-16T20:12:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
Putin 'wants to stop fighting,' Trump says, dismisses Russia's territorial ambitions	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 16 that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;wants to stop fighting&quot; Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, dismissing Moscow&apos;s territorial ambitions in the embattled country. &quot;I think he wants to stop fighting. I see that. We spoke long and hard,&quot; Trump told reporters, referring to a phone call he held with Putin on Feb. 12 in which the two leaders agreed negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would start &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;They have a big, powerful machine. You understand that,&quot; Trump added. &quot;And they defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. You know, they&#x2019;ve been fighting a long time... But I think he would like to stop fighting.&quot; Trump&apos;s comments come as a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff readies to meet its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18, Axios reported. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky seemingly rebuffed Trump&apos;s opinion on Putin&apos;s motives during an interview with NBC News on Feb. 16. &quot;There are risks that this can be Poland and Lithuania, because we believe that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will wage war against NATO,&quot; he said. Russia is training 150,000 troops in Belarus for a large-scale operation that could happen as early as this summer, Zelensky said. The preparations could signal a plan to invade a NATO country. European leaders, who will participate in an emergency summit in Paris on Feb. 17 over concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe, have shared similar concerns over Russia&apos;s territorial ambitions. When asked by reporters whether he believes Russia seeks to seize the entire Ukrainian territory, Trump dismissed the prospects. &quot;I think he wants to stop. That was my question to him. Because if he&#x2019;s going to go on, that would have been a big problem for us, and that would have caused me a big problem, because you just can&#x2019;t let that happen.&quot; Earlier in the day, Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the peace negotiations and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-wants-to-stop-fighting-trump-says-dismisses-russias-territorial-ambitions/	2025-02-16T19:32:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
US, Russian officials to meet on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia, Axios reports	A U.S. delegation is set to meet with its Russian counterparts on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia, Axios reported on Feb. 16, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The delegation, led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, is set to begin negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. It was not immediately clear as to who will be a part of the Russian delegation, although one source told Axios that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was likely to attend. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Kyiv has not received an invitation to attend the meeting in Riyadh, with President Volodymyr Zelensky telling reporters that he found out about the meetings through media reports. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during the Munich Security Conference.

Rubio echoed similar comments stating that Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. The upcoming meetings come amid an official visit by Zelensky to the United Arab Emirates, with planned trips to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the coming days. Zelensky said he has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations while in the Middle East.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russian-officials-to-meet-on-feb-18-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-16T18:27:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194087620.jpg
Trump confirms Zelensky will take part in Ukraine peace talks as US, Russia prepare Saudi meeting	A team of advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian officials next week in Saudi Arabia to begin negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, two U.S. government officials familiar with the matter told CBS News. The delegation, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, will represent Trump in discussions following his recent phone calls with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump confirmed the efforts, adding that the U.S. is working hard to facilitate peace and assuring that Zelensky will be involved in the talks. Concerns have been raised about Ukraine&apos;s role in the negotiations, with European officials emphasizing that Kyiv must not be sidelined. Trump reaffirmed that Zelensky would have a say in the process and mentioned the possibility of allowing European nations to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. However, he expressed skepticism about Zelensky&#x2019;s warning that Russia could escalate its war beyond Ukraine if the U.S. withdraws from NATO. Rubio, speaking on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; on Feb. 16 said Trump would quickly determine whether Russia&#x2019;s interest in peace is genuine or merely a tactic to buy time. Discussions between the U.S. and Russia have already begun, with Rubio speaking to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the weekend, according to CBS. The potential terms of an agreement remain unclear. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that &quot;everything is on the table&quot; but suggested Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership is unlikely. Trump echoed this sentiment, saying that Russia has long opposed Ukraine joining the alliance and implying that this stance would not change. Hegseth also cast doubt on Ukraine&apos;s ability to reclaim all its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Further high-level discussions are expected, with Trump confirming that he plans to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia &quot;very soon,&quot; though he did not specify a date.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-confirms-zelensky-will-take-part-in-ukraine-peace-talks-as-us-russia-prepare-saudi-meeting/	2025-02-16T16:35:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1993704243.jpg
Starmer open to deploying British troops for Ukraine peacekeeping effort	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled that his country is prepared to send troops to Ukraine as part of a European-led peacekeeping force to enforce a future peace deal. In an article for the Telegraph, Starmer acknowledged the gravity of such a decision, emphasizing that he did not take lightly the idea of placing British servicemen and women in harm&#x2019;s way: &quot;But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine&#x2019;s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.&quot; His remarks come ahead of a key meeting in Paris, where European leaders will discuss security commitments for Ukraine amid growing concerns over reduced U.S. involvement in European defense. The Paris summit, convened by French President Emmanuel Macron, was prompted by the exclusion of European nations from early peace talks between the U.S. and Russia, as well as indications that a future Donald Trump administration would scale back security guarantees for Europe. &quot;I am heading to Paris with a very clear message for our European friends. We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defense and bearing our own burden. We have talked about it for too long &#x2013; and President (Donald) Trump is right to demand that we get on with it,&quot; Starmer said. Starmer&apos;s statement is expected to increase pressure on allies, particularly Germany, to support a European-led initiative aimed at ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s long-term security. He also suggested that the U.K. could serve as a crucial link between Europe and the United States in brokering sustainable peace. While Russia and the U.S. are set to begin peace discussions in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine has been seemingly left out of the negotiations&#x2014;a move Starmer strongly criticized. Drawing parallels to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, he warned that sidelining Kyiv could lead to a fragile ceasefire that fails to deter future Russian aggression. The prime minister reiterated Britain&#x2019;s long-term support for Ukraine, including its pledge of three billion ($3.6 billion) pounds annually for military aid until at least 2030, and said that the U.K. is willing to contribute troops to ensure security guarantees. &quot;We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations because anything less would accept Putin&#x2019;s position that Ukraine is not a real nation,&quot; Starmer wrote. The specifics of a European peacekeeping force remain uncertain, but one proposal under discussion involves deploying European troops behind Ukrainian forces rather than directly along the front lines of a potential ceasefire. Some estimates suggest that as many as 100,000 soldiers may be required to make such a mission effective, raising questions about whether European nations would commit sufficient forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-open-to-deploying-british-troops-for-ukraine-peacekeeping-effort-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-16T15:38:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Ukraine’s place in EU, NATO non-negotiable, Finnish president says	Finnish President Alexander Stubb has emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the European Union and NATO is non-negotiable, adding that these alliances are essential for ensuring the country&#x2019;s sovereignty and security. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16, Stubb outlined a three-stage process that he believes Ukraine must go through to achieve peace, highlighting the importance of continued Western support. The first stage, according to Stubb, involves initial negotiations where Ukraine should receive military aid and increased international pressure must be applied on Russia. This would include expanded sanctions and asset freezes. He noted that during this phase, the United States may propose temporary security guarantees for Ukraine, but the timeline for these discussions remains unclear. Stubb described the second stage as a ceasefire, stressing that this would not mark the beginning of a peace process but rather serve as an interim measure. He suggested that a ceasefire should include border demarcation, international monitoring, and humanitarian agreements such as prisoner exchanges and the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children. Additionally, he argued that if Russia were to launch another attack, Ukraine should immediately be granted NATO membership as a deterrent. Drawing on Finland&#x2019;s own historical experience, Stubb stressed that any resolution must uphold Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. He recalled how Finland, despite maintaining its sovereignty after World War II, was forced to cede some territory and accept foreign policy restrictions. In Ukraine&#x2019;s case, he made it clear that no such compromises should be made on its future alliances. Stubb added that full recognition of Ukraine as a sovereign European state, backed by security guarantees and NATO integration, must be the end goal of any diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-place-in-eu-nato-non-negotiable-finnish-president-says/	2025-02-16T15:23:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199284056.jpg
Zelensky arrives in UAE, hints at humanitarian, economic cooperation	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with First Lady Olena Zelenska for an official visit on Feb. 16. The trip comes directly after Zelensky&apos;s appearance at the Munich Security Conference and kicks off a regional tour that includes official visits to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Zelensky and Zelenska met UAE officials upon their arrival in the country on Feb. 16. &quot;Our top priority is bringing even more of our people home from captivity,&quot; Zelensky said. The visit will center on economic partnership and bilateral cooperation in investment, Zelensky added. Zelensky hinted at a possible important agreement between the two nations, mentioning a &quot;large-scale humanitarian program&quot; in his announcement. Zelensky told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that he intends to pay official visits to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Delegations from Saudi Arabia and Ukraine met on Feb. 16 to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit. The president&apos;s Middle Eastern tour begins as senior U.S. and Russian officials prepare to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Zelensky said he has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations in the Middle East.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-the-uae-hints-at-humanitarian-and-economic-cooperation/	2025-02-16T13:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-16-at-3_54_01-PM.png
A colonial agreement' — former Ukrainian official slams US minerals deal, AP reports	The United States offered Ukraine &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; on exchanging Ukrainian rare earth minerals for U.S. military aid, a former senior Ukrainian official told the Associated Press (AP) on Feb. 16. The comment comes after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the document, saying it did not sufficiently protect Ukraine&apos;s interests. &quot;For me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,&quot; Zelensky said. The president did not give details as to the problems with the document. &quot;It&apos;s a colonial agreement and Zelensky cannot sign it,&quot; a former senior Ukrainian official told the AP. The former official spoke under the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely. The current and former senior Ukrainian officials who spoke to the AP said that the U.S. delegates at the Munich Security Conference did not offer any security guarantees in exchange for Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals. According to the senior Ukrainian official, the U.S. delegates were more focused on the commercial aspects of a future partnership and did not have &quot;ready answers&quot; to how Ukraine&apos;s mineral deposits could be protected in the event of ongoing Russian aggression. White House National Security Council Spokesperson Brian Hughes said Zelensky&apos;s refusal to sign the agreement was &quot;short-sighted.&quot; National Security Adviser Mike Waltz also encouraged Zelensky to take the deal in comments to Fox News on Feb. 16. &quot;Zelensky would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re talking about growing the pie for the Ukrainian economy.&quot; Waltz has previously said that the U.S. needs to &quot;recoup&quot; the costs of former military aid packages to Ukraine. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, unnamed American officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has signaled that it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-colonial-agreement-former-ukrainian-official-slams-us-minerals-deal-ap-reports/	2025-02-16T13:21:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-680305234.jpg
Trump wants ceasefire in Ukraine by Easter, Bloomberg reports	U.S. President Donald Trump wants to secure a ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by Easter, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 16, citing unnamed officials. Trump has previously promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Since his victory in the U.S. presidential election, that timeline has been revised. The U.S administration has told European officials that it hopes to achieve a ceasefire agreement by Easter, which falls on April 20, Bloomberg reported. Trump&apos;s plan for a quick resolution to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine is ambitious and &quot;potentially unrealistic,&quot; an unnamed source said. It is more likely Trump will be able to obtain a ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of the year and not by Easter, one person said. Over the past week, the U.S. has made several moves to advance its Russia-Ukraine agenda &#x2014;&#xA0;some of which have alarmed European and Ukrainian officials. Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky later the same day. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, shocked European leaders on Feb. 15 when he said Europe won&apos;t be directly involved in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. France plans to host an emergency summit on Feb. 17 for European leaders to discuss strategies toward Russia and Ukraine amid fears that the U.S. will shut the EU out of the negotiations process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-looking-to-have-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-by-easter-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-16T12:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198721894.jpg
Ukraine preparing for Zelensky to visit Saudi Arabia	Delegations from Saudi Arabia and Ukraine met on Feb. 16 to discuss increased investment and bilateral cooperation between the two nations, ahead of a planned visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The news comes as senior U.S. officials prepare to travel to Saudia Arabia for talks with unspecified Russian representatives. Ukraine will reportedly not be taking part in these discussions. The Ukrainian delegation is preparing with local officials for Zelensky&apos;s visit to Saudia Arabia, during which he will sign economic agreements with various countries in the region, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced on Feb. 16. &quot;I am convinced that we have prospects for even more active involvement in investment from Middle Eastern countries,&quot; she said. &quot;Today, we saw significant interest, mainly in infrastructure projects, energy projects, innovation proposals, (and) agribusiness, primarily fertilizer production where Saudi Arabia has expertise.&quot; Days before Svyrydenko&apos;s announcement, Zelensky told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that he intends to pay official visits to Saudia Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, but has no plans to meet with any Russian or U.S. delegations in these countries. &quot;I will not meet with Russians, but then I will not meet with Americans there,&quot; he said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to hold meetings with Russian officials in the coming days. The representatives from the Russian delegation have not been identified. Rubio characterized the talks as preliminary and said that &quot;real negotiations&quot; on ending the war will include Ukraine and Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia as part of his efforts to broker a ceasefire deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukrainian officials denied reports that a Ukrainian delegation would participate in the talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said that there was &quot;nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing.&quot; &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-delegation-in-saudi-arabia-discuss-bilateral-trade-and-investment/	2025-02-16T12:12:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/SverydenkoSArabia.jpg
One year following Navalny's death, West, Navalnaya condemn Putin's Russia	Yuliya Navalnaya, widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and Western leaders decried repression in Russia on Feb. 16, the anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death. Navalny, an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was arrested on politically motivated charges in January 2021. He was convicted and later died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024. Western countries, including Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, issued a joint statement on the anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death. &quot;We reiterate that the ultimate responsibility for his death lies with the Russian authorities. One year on, Russia&apos;s dire human rights record continues to deteriorate ... All to serve its own interests,&quot; the statement read. The statement condemned Russia for holding over 800 political prisoners who are tortured and forced into psychiatric detention. &quot;The Kremlin crushes peaceful dissent, maintains a climate of fear, and undermines the rule of law,&quot; it said. The countries also claimed that Russia uses the threat of imprisonment to quash opposition to the full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Many (are) imprisoned for speaking out against the Kremlin&apos;s illegal invasion of Ukraine and the brutality shown towards the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement said. The anniversary of Navalny&apos;s death falls during the Munich Security Conference, where European and U.S. officials convened to discuss the status of the war as it approaches its third year. EU High Representative Kaja Kallas issued her own statement regarding Navalny on Feb. 16. &quot;Navalny gave his life for a free and democratic Russia. Today, his lawyers are unjustly imprisoned along with hundreds of political prisoners,&quot; she said. &quot;Russia is increasingly waging an illegal war of aggression against Ukraine while continuing its domestic repression, persecuting those who advocate for democracy ...

Since her husband&apos;s death, Navalnaya has emerged as a key Russian opposition figure. She spoke at the Munich Security Conference at a panel alongside Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, warning against attempts to negotiate with Putin. &quot;Even if you decided to negotiate with Putin, just remember he will lie,&quot; she said on Feb. 14. A vocal opponent of Putin, Navalnaya has expressed ambivalence toward arming Ukraine in its defense against Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-year-following-navalnys-death-the-west-navalnaya-condemn-putins-russia/	2025-02-16T11:12:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2008366667.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US wants 50% of Ukraine's minerals, may deploy troops to guard them; Zelensky says nearly 250,000 Russian soldiers killed in war	Key developments on Feb. 15-16: The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the agreement after Bessent&apos;s presentation, saying he needed to study it and consult with others, NBC reported, citing eight U.S. officials briefed on the meeting. At the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that his lawyers would examine the document handed over by Bessent in Kyiv and make some changes to it. He called the U.S. proposal &quot;a memorandum,&quot; not a security agreement. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky. The Russian army has lost almost 250,000 soldiers in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky claimed that Moscow lost nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. In addition, a total of over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the president. Zelensky&apos;s estimate of Russian losses matches that of the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. According to the military, Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since 2022. &quot;We completely destroyed the North Korean units that (Vladimir) Putin had to bring in because his own forces weren&#x2019;t enough to hold back our counteroffensive,&quot; Zelensky said, speaking of Ukraine&apos;s Kursk operation. &quot;For over six months now, Ukrainians have been holding a foothold inside Russian territory, even though it was Russia that wanted to create a &apos;buffer zone&apos; inside our land,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky previously said that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 in an interview with Newsmax. Zelensky&apos;s comments come after earlier in the week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Ukraine was unlikely to restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Zelensky told Newsmax that U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia&apos;s war if Europe supports his plan. &quot;I think that he (Trump) needs, very much, the success, and, otherwise, everybody will say that (this) was the line of Biden and this is the line of Trump. I think he needs success, and we need success and trust him. I hope that he will be on our side,&quot; Zelensky added. The president stressed that a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war,&quot; which should be agreed upon between Ukraine and the U.S. president and backed by both sides. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after a joint plan with Trump and the European Union was developed. A group of European countries is quietly developing a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine due to concerns about changing U.S. priorities on security on the continent, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. The news came amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire agreement is reached between Ukraine and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly said it wouldn&apos;t send its troops to Ukraine, pushing for Europe to take initiative. France and Britain are leading the initiative of putting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevklur told the Associated Press that European allies are &quot;in a very early stage&quot; of developing the plan to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Pevklur said that it is &quot;critical&quot; for the allies to understand the contact line in Ukraine before devising a plan. According to Pevklur, if the Russian and Ukrainian armies reduce their forces to a &quot;couple of thousand&quot; on each side, it will not be a problem for Europe &quot;to also be there.&quot; But implementing the plan will be much harder if there is a &quot;boiling conflict.&quot; Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributingforces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot; Russian drone strikes in the early hours of Feb. 16 shook southern Ukraine, leaving over 100,000 residents in Mykolaiv Oblast without heat, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. &quot;This bears no relationship to military action and the situation on the front. This once again proves that Russians are fighting against our people, against life in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote of the strikes on his Telegram channel. Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitaliy Kim wrote earlier in the day that the attack on the region included nine Shahed drones, with blasts and wreckage from the drones damaging five high-rise buildings and injuring one 64-year-old man. &quot;This was done deliberately to leave people without heat in below-zero temperatures and create a humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; wrote Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who said that as of shortly before 1 p.m. Kyiv time, 46,000 people were still without heat. Radio Free Europe published video from parts of Mykolaiv affected, showing shopping centers with their walls demolished and stores with windows blown out. Ukraine had recently seen some reprieve from Russia&apos;s continuous attacks on civilian energy infrastructure thanks to an unusually warm winter. Temperatures overnight are forecast to drop to -9&#xB0; Celcius in Mykolaiv. The same night, Russia launched a total of 143 drones, of which Ukraine&apos;s air force said it shot down 95. Forty others and two Russian ballistic missiles also missed their targets, per the official tally. Several elderly civilians in Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts were also injured in the broader Russian air campaign last night, according to local officials.

Ukraine, Europe must be involved in peace talks, Rubio says	Both Ukraine and Europe must play a role in serious negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to end the war, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News on Feb. 16. Rubio&apos;s comments come as he prepares to travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with senior Russian officials for talks without representation from Ukraine or the EU. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a good step, but has to be followed up by action, Rubio told CBS News. &quot;Now, obviously it has to be followed up by action, so the next few weeks and days will determine whether it&apos;s serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace,&quot; he said. Rubio declined to say who the U.S. delegation will be meeting with in Saudia Arabia. &quot;Nothing&apos;s been finalized yet,&quot; he said. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff are set to join Rubio for the talks in Riyadh, according to various media outlets. Ukraine will not be participating, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. The talks in Saudia Arabia are preliminary, Rubio said, and &quot;real negotiations&quot; will include Ukraine and Europe. &quot;Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are &#x2014; if it&apos;s real negotiations, and we&apos;re not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they&apos;re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they&apos;ve contributed to this effort,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re just not there yet. We really aren&apos;t, but hopefully we will be, because we&apos;d all like to see this war end.&quot; Trump has repeatedly pledged to negotiate a swift deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, though his proposed timeline of within &quot;24 hours&quot; has been extended to an indefinite period. European leaders have expressed alarm in recent days at their apparent exclusion from discussions between Russia and the U.S. regarding Ukraine. France plans to host an emergency summit on Feb. 17 over these concerns. President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized that both the EU and the U.S. must have a strong presence at the negotiating table once Russia and Ukraine begin peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-europe-must-be-involved-in-peace-talks-rubio-says/	2025-02-16T09:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194469087.jpg
Arrests of top commanders in Ukraine underscore political power games, army commanders and experts say	Last month, four top-level military commanders in Ukraine were arrested for alleged mismanagement of battlefield operations &#x2014; in the first criminal investigations of top military leadership since the start of the full-scale invasion. Three high-ranking officers involved in what&#x2019;s being called &#x201C;the generals&#x2019; case&#x201D; &#x2014; Yurii Halushkin, Artur Horbenko, and Illia Lapin &#x2014; are accused of failing to defend Kharkiv Oblast during Russia&#x2019;s renewed offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian troops managed to get several kilometers beyond the border before Ukrainian troops halted the advance. In a separate case, Colonel Dmytro Riumshyn stands accused of failing to report and prevent desertions in his newly formed 155th Brigade, ultimately leading to 56 soldiers deserting while training in France, and hundreds more &#x2014; in Ukraine. While some Ukrainians welcomed the news, some experts and army commanders see it as a heavy-handed attempt to suppress potential military opposition to peace negotiations and damage the popularity of military leadership before possible elections that could be held if the war comes to an end this year. &#x201C;These investigations mean that the government is afraid of the military as a political force,&#x201D; Ukrainian political scientist Yevhen Mahda told the Kyiv Independent. They also warn of the harm prosecuting high-level commanders can bring to the military during wartime. Ukrainian law on &#x201C;combat immunity&#x201D; passed in 2022 promised commanders freedom to make decisions on the front without legal consequences for their failure. But the arrest of the four top officers shows vestiges of a broken military justice system. On May 10, 2024, Russian forces crossed the Russian border into Kharkiv Oblast, located in Ukraine&#x2019;s northeast, swiftly occupying some border villages. The attack came forty days after Brigadier General Yurii Halushkin was appointed the commander of the Kharkiv Operational Tactical Grouping, responsible for defending the area. On the second day of the offensive, Halushkin was replaced in his position by Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi. With reinforcements sent in, Ukrainian forces stopped Russia&apos;s advance. Some border areas remain occupied to this day, and the fighting continues up to 8 kilometers into Ukrainian territory. The initial success of the Russian offensive sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning that led to both military losses and thousands of civilians displaced from their homes. The newly occupied territories were already liberated once from occupation in Ukraine&#x2019;s 2022 counteroffensive in the area. The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) launched an investigation into the circumstances around the border&#x2019;s breach in May. The agency detained Halushkin on Jan. 20 along with two other officers commanding troops in Kharkiv Oblast during the offensive. &#x201C;Their negligent attitude to military service allowed the Russian Federation troops to seize part of the territory (of Kharkiv region),&#x201D; the SBI&#x2019;s statement said. &#x201C;Also, the actions of the commanders led to the loss of personnel and weapons, and disrupted the defense of the state border in their area of responsibility.&#x201D; A picture of the commander of the 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade being detained released by the State Bureau of Investigation on Jan. 20Halushkin was accused of assigning inadequate defense positions to the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade led by Lieutenant General Artur Horbenko, and failing to reinforce and support them with artillery and air force. The inadequate command allegedly led to some units of the 125th brigade deserting their positions, which allowed Russians to advance, according to the SBI. Horbenko was also accused of failing to properly prepare positions and equip his troops, as well as organize fire support and communication during the fight. &#x201C;(Horbenko) was unaware of the actual situation on the battlefield,&#x201D; the SBI said. Colonel Illia Lapin, a commander of the 415th Rifle Battalion of the 23rd Brigade tasked to defend the area, was accused of inadequate battle management and preparation of defense positions, as well as allowing twelve servicemen to desert positions. The SBI claimed it received assistance from the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Command in arresting the suspects. &#xA0; But Halushkin&#x2019;s lawyer Velychko told the Kyiv Independent that the military police found no violation of the military charter in his client&#x2019;s actions in Kharkiv Oblast during an earlier internal investigation. Halushkin appealed to the General Staff for reinforcements before the renewed Russian offensive, but &#x201C;the answer was &#x2013; you can only rely on what you have,&#x201D; Velychko said. &#x201C;He believes that he had properly used all the forces and means he had (for repelling the attack),&#x201D; Velychko added. Halushkin said in a statement published by his lawyer that he will continue defending his command decisions in detention. &#x201C;If the General Staff of Ukraine does not have enough brigades and weapons to comply with the standards (of the military charter), it is not the fault of the commanders,&#x201D; Halushkin wrote. Although President Volodymyr Zelensky said in July that the talks on who&#x2019;s to blame for Russian success in partially occupying Kharkiv Oblast should be held after the war, he praised the arrests of top commanders on Jan. 20, saying that &#x201C;no status or past achievements can override the rule of law.&#x201D; The court set multi-million-hryvnia bails for the officers. An anonymous donor settled the Hr 5 million (around $118,000) bail for Halushkin on the morning of Jan. 22, while former President Petro Poroshenko publicly offered to do the same on Facebook &#x2014; in a post he has since deleted. Hours later, Halushkin was arrested once again without bail just as he was leaving the detention center, drawing both criticism and praise among some military personnel and politicians. &#x201C;(The investigators) launched a new criminal case against him three hours before his repeated detention,&#x201D; Velychko told the Kyiv Independent, adding that the new case was registered less than an hour after Poroshenko&#x2019;s post. The SBI claimed it had discovered &#x201C;new facts&#x201D; in the investigation and launched a new case under a different article, but Velychko maintains that investigators &#x201C;simply copied seven volumes of materials from the first criminal case.&#x201D; The harsh measures are a &#x201C;short-sighted and dangerous&#x201D; tactic, used by the political leadership before the potential upcoming struggle for power to &#x201C;tame&#x201D; the military, as it remains the most trusted institution in society according to polls, political scientist Mahda said. If society accepts these criminal cases against commanders, the country&#x2019;s political leadership &#x201C;can swing for the fences, for example, (to prosecute former Commander-in-Chief) Zaluzhny,&#x201D; he added, referring to Zaluzhny&#x2019;s continued high popularity among Ukrainians.

(Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)The same polls show a significant decrease in trust in the president and the government. Ukrainian authorities might be using &#x201C;the generals&#x2019; cases&#x201D; to shift the blame. Riumshyn, former commander of the 155th mechanized brigade &#x201C;Anna Kyivska,&#x201D; was also arrested on Jan. 20. The systematic problems in the &#x201C;French-trained brigade&#x201D; were reported by Ukrainian and foreign media, embarrassing the Ukrainian leadership, which lauded the 155th brigade as a flagship project for new NATO-trained and armed Ukrainian brigades. Ukrainian journalist Yurii Butusov, whose extensive report on the failings in the brigade was cited in foreign media, blamed President Zelensky, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and other members of the high military command for the many problems beyond Riumshyn&#x2019;s responsibilities as brigade commander. &#x201C;There was a lot of publicity in this situation. Someone has to be the fall guy now,&#x201D; Riumshyn told journalists in court, explaining why he was arrested. Despite the publicity of both cases, pre-trial criminal proceedings were closed to the public, and the case materials of Halushkin&#x2019;s case remain undisclosed, considered as military secrets, even to his defense, Velychko said. High military commanders and regular soldiers have since said that the arrests are gravely detrimental to the war effort, as they undermine commanders&#x2019; motivation, trust in the higher command, and willingness to act quickly on the battlefield. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a 100% political case,&#x201D; Anatolii Kozel, former commander of the 53rd brigade, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This does not benefit (the army).&#x201D; Lieutenant General Serhii Naiev, former commander of the Joint Defense Forces, criticized the arrests in his interview with a major Ukrainian media Ukrainska Pravda on Feb. 10. &#x201C;It is unacceptable that trials of military leaders are launched during the war,&#x201D; he said, adding that even Russia doesn&#x2019;t prosecute generals for their failures. He also put the responsibility on political leadership for Ukraine&#x2019;s stalled preparation for the Russian invasion in 2022, which led to the occupation of the southern part of the country, deaths of civilians, and significant military losses. The next day after the publication, Ukrainian media reported that Naiev was appointed as a front-line commander of a small tactical group in Ukraine&#x2019;s east &#x2014; a move seen as retaliation for his interview. A new comprehensive military justice system wasn&#x2019;t developed in Ukraine after the country gained independence, with the system inherited from the Soviet Union largely dismantled before 2014. And then Russia invaded in the east and annexed Crimea in 2014. The rising need for a new, reformed system was most visible in the case of Major General Viktor Nazarov. In 2017, a civilian court gave him a prison sentence for failing to prevent the downing of a transport aircraft with 49 Ukrainian servicemen by Russian mercenaries in the eastern Luhansk Oblast in 2014. The sentence was welcomed by the families of fallen soldiers and criticized by then-President Petro Poroshenko for placing the blame on Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership for the incident. In 2021, however, Nazarov was acquitted by the Supreme Court, arguing that he would have had no way of preventing the attack. The seven years of controversial proceedings laid bare the lack of a clear framework for tackling these types of cases. The most recent cases last month are also not the first criminal proceedings with political undertones since the start of President Zelensky&#x2019;s presidency. The aftermath of a Russian attack against Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast on May 11, 2024 amid Russia&apos;s renewed offensive in the area. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)&#x201C;My case and the case involving (Galushkin, Horbenko, and Lapin) are not parallels. This is one methodology,&#x201D; Major General Dmytro Marchenko told Ukrainska Pravda in a recent interview on his being a primary subject of the so-called &#x201C;armored vests case&#x201D; in 2019. Serving as a top Defense Ministry official responsible for material supply of the army since 2015, he was arrested in 2019, when the State Bureau of Investigation accused him and several other officials of procuring thousands of low-quality armored vests at inflated prices. Marchenko was held in a civilian detention center for a month &#x2014; a decision called &#x201C;surprising&#x201D; by the Defense Ministry &#x2014; and released on a Hr 20 million ($480,000) bail, paid mostly by former President Poroshenko&#x2019;s family and regular people&#x2019;s donations. Marchenko claimed that his case was politically motivated, aimed at damaging then-President Poroshenko. In 2020, a Kyiv court suspended the prosecutor and investigator on the case due to their &#x201C;biased attitude.&#x201D; The investigation of the &#x201C;armored vests case&#x201D; essentially froze armored vests procurement in Ukraine until weeks before the full-scale Russian invasion. After it began, all the disputed vests were distributed to Ukrainian soldiers, though the case remained open, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing Marchenko. Marchenko commanded the defense of the southern city of Mykolayiv in 2022, helping to successfully stop the Russian advance. On Nov. 8, 2024, he resigned from the military due to health problems. &#x201C;Such cases demoralize the military entirely, and cause uncertainty among all levels of command &#x2014; from platoon leader to the section commander,&#x201D; Marchenko said in an interview, referring to the ongoing investigation against the Ukrainian officers.	https://kyivindependent.com/arrests-of-top-commanders-in-ukraine-underscore-political-power-games-army-commanders-and-experts-say/	2025-02-16T09:10:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192471550.jpg
Putin will wage war against NATO,' Zelensky tells NBC News	Intelligence reports indicate that there is a &quot;high risk&quot; Russia is preparing troops for a possible invasion of NATO member states, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News in an interview published Feb. 16. Zelensky spoke to NBC on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where he is leading a Ukrainian delegation in talks with European and U.S. leaders on the current state of the war as it approaches its third-year anniversary. Russia is training 150,000 troops in Belarus for a large-scale operation that could happen as early as this summer, Zelensky said. The preparations could signal a plan to invade a NATO country. &quot;There are risks that this can be Poland and Lithuania, because we believe that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will wage war against NATO,&quot; he said. Ukraine has &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;documents&quot; regarding Russia&apos;s troop buildup in Belarus, but does not exactly know what Putin is planning to do, according to Zelensky. The president said Ukraine had shared these intelligence reports with allies. Russia is &quot;waiting for a weakening of NATO,&quot; Zelensky warned. He also said he believes Putin only wants a ceasefire in order to prepare greater numbers of troops for more ambitious future military actions. &quot;He is thinking not only about Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. There is a &quot;high risk&quot; that Russia will set its sights on other countries, particularly those near Ukraine that are now NATO member states, he said. At the outset of the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia was training large numbers of soldiers in Belarus for a major military escalation. In his comments to NBC, he said that the move echoed the military exercises Russia staged ahead of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Two days before the conference began, a declassified Danish intelligence report warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years, if Moscow &quot;perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided.&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that such an attack would be &quot;devastating&quot; for Moscow. &quot;If Putin attacks NATO, the reaction will be devastating. He will lose,&quot; Rutte said. The warnings come amid a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, NATO, and Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of the alliance, sparking outrage last year when he said he would let Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO members failing to meet defense spending criteria. Trump has also arranged to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks without representation from Ukraine or Europe. Ahead of any ceasefire negotiations with Russia, Trump has already signaled that he believes NATO membership for Ukraine is not &quot;practical.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-will-wage-war-against-nato-zelensky-tells-nbc-news/	2025-02-16T08:59:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199789864.jpg

Europe needs 'special envoy' to take part in Ukraine peace talks, says Finnish President	The European Union needs a special envoy to Ukraine peace talks to avoid being cut out of negotiations, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Feb. 16 at the Munich Security Conference. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the day previously that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks. A new European special envoy, Stubb said, would help focus European efforts and give them a voice in such talks. &quot;If there is a negotiating table, I think we need to do something similar to what was done in Kosovo. Europe needs to have a special envoy,&quot; Stubb said. &quot;And then, a deputy envoy, who is on the level of Kellogg, (Steve) Witkoff, (Andriy) Yermak, or (Yuriy) Ushakov.&quot; Earlier, Politico reported that U.S. officials were heading to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian representatives for talks meant to lay the ground work for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv was not invited and was even surprised by the announced meeting in Saudi Arabia, causing alarm that negotiations to end Russia&apos;s nearly three year invasion will happen without Ukraine&apos;s involvement. Croation Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic voiced a similar sentiment as Stubb, saying that Europe needs a strong representative in negotiations, Reuters reported. &quot;What we lacked on Ukraine in recent years was one personality highly respected by everyone, taken into account in Moscow, taken into account in Kyiv, and having support in Washington and European capitals and other leaders, including the global South, that could have the authority to manage the peace talks,&quot; said Plenkovic.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-to-have-a-special-envoy-to-take-part-in-ukraine-peace-talks-says-finnish-president/	2025-02-16T05:19:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1512920640.jpeg
Zelensky's proposed European army 'will not happen,' says Polish foreign minister	There will be no joint European Union army to counter Russian aggression and compensate any withdrawal in U.S. support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said to local television late on Feb. 15, Reuters reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 15 called on Europe to create a unified army at the Munich Security Conference to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine and Europe. &quot;Many leaders have talked about Europe needing its own army. An army of Europe. I really believe that the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created,&quot;Zelensky said during his speech. In response to a question about creating a unified European armed forces, Sikorski said that &quot;we should be careful with this term because people understand different things,&quot; Reuters reported. &quot;If you understand by it the unification of national armies, it will not happen,&quot; Sikorski told TVP World. &quot;But I have been an advocate for Europe, for the European Union, to develop its own defense capabilities.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s proposal came in light of waning U.S. military support for Ukraine and Europe writ large. Ukraine hopes to see Europe fill the looming gap in its fight against Russia. Sikorski acknowledged a need to expand European militaries. &quot;If the U.S. wants us to step up in defense, it should have a national component, a NATO component, but I also believe a European EU component, EU subsidies for the defense industry to build up our capacity to produce, but also an EU force worthy of its name,&quot; Sikorski said. Sikorski also said Poland would not put troops on the ground in Ukraine. &quot;Poland&apos;s duty to NATO is to protect the eastern flank, i.e. its own territory.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-proposed-army-of-europe-will-not-happen-says-polish-minister/	2025-02-16T03:45:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179726505.jpg

Success already 'feels possible' after start of collaboration with US officials, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that success &#x201C;already feels possible&#x201D; as his administration begins collaborations with U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team. Zelensky noted that he had a good phone call with Trump before the Munich Security Conference, and important meetings with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and State Secretary Marco Rubio. He emphasized that the world looks to the U.S. as a crucial force in stopping conflicts and ensuring lasting peace. Zelensky also said that the two countries are working together on creating a &#x201C;special agreement&#x201D; that will strengthen the U.S. and Ukraine, but did not provide further details. &#x201C;We have started working with President Trump&apos;s team and we already feel that success is possible. It is the U.S. that the world now looks to as a force that can not only stop the war, but also help ensure the reliability of peace after the war,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on Telegram. However, he cautioned against potential attempts by Russian President Vladimir Putin to manipulate the situation and stressed the importance of joint efforts by Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe to achieve real peace. &#x201C;Of course, there will continue to be many different attempts by Putin to deceive everyone and prolong the war. But real peace is possible. And we have to achieve it: Ukraine, the United States, Europe,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky told NBC News that it would be &quot;very, very, very difficult&quot; for Ukraine to sustain its fight against Russia and remain secure in the long term without American support. Zelensky stressed that while Ukraine would always fight for its survival, the chances of success would be significantly diminished without help from the United States.	https://kyivindependent.com/success-already-feels-possible-after-start-of-collaboration-with-us-officials-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T22:15:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361.jpg
G7 leaders: Future sanctions hinged on Russia's 'good faith efforts' during peace talks	The Group of Seven (G7) countries agreed to link any future tightening of sanctions against Russia to the progress of upcoming peace negotiations, after a meeting on Feb. 15. The G7 ministers convened at the Munich Security Conference, which is ongoing from Feb. 14 until Feb. 16. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha participated in some of the talks held by the ministers. The group emphasized in a statement that any new sanctions after February 2025 should depend on whether Russia &#x201C;makes real, good faith efforts to end its war against Ukraine.&#x201D; They also reaffirmed their &#x201C;unwavering support&#x201D; for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine with military and financial aid. In October 2024, the G7 reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-leaders-future-sanctions-hinged-on-russias-good-faith-efforts-during-peace-talks/	2025-02-15T19:53:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
France to host emergency summit on Ukraine as Trump administration and Russian officials to begin peace negotiations without Europe	European leaders are set to gather in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit over concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Feb. 15. This comes amid recent talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as a speech on Feb. 14 by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance at the Munich Security Conference, in which he attacked current European politics and values. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Sikorski mentioned the upcoming meeting between European leaders during the Munich Security Conference, and expressed hope that leaders would take the matter seriously. It is unclear which leaders will be present, but British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk have so far confirmed their attendance.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-host-emergency-summit-on-ukraine-as-trump-administration-begins-peace-negotiations-with-russia-without-input-from-europe/	2025-02-15T17:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241470695.jpg
US requests European countries to draft proposals outlining post-war security assurances for Ukraine, FT reports	The U.S. has asked European countries to outline their potential security and peacekeeping contributions to Ukraine as part of any future peace negotiations with Russia, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 15, citing undisclosed sources. The countries have been asked to indicate proposed amounts of military aid and peacekeeping forces, as well as other defense measures. According to the sources, the U.S. State Department sent a formal request to European governments this week. The request seeks explicit details on types of military equipment and troop brigade number commitments from the countries. This initiative comes ahead of a European tour by Keith Kellogg, President Trump&apos;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who is set to visit Brussels next week. According to Kellogg&#x2019;s comments on Feb. 15, Europe will not be &#x201C;directly involved in negotiations&#x201D; to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-requesting-european-countries-to-draft-proposals-outlining-post-war-security-assurances-for-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-02-15T16:16:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643099758.jpg
Trump's call to Putin was a mistake, Polish FM says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin was a mistake, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky the same day. The U.S. President has vowed to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The phone call between Trump and Putin was only beneficial to the Kremlin. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Sikorski said, according to Polish media outlet RMF24. &quot;There is nothing more dangerous than an empty guarantee,&quot; The Foreign Minister said, adding that &quot;Ukraine already has (security) guarantees that turned out to be empty.&quot; Sikorski called for the West to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia&apos;s aggression as long as it wants to fight back. Russia is waging a &quot;classic colonial war&quot; against Ukraine, the official added. Europe is facing a crisis because it &quot;has used the peace dividend for too long,&quot; The Foreign Minister said. &quot;If Putin succeeds in conquering Ukraine, it will send a signal to China&#x2026; This will have direct consequences for the American strategy and alliance system, and perhaps for the future of Taiwan,&quot; Sikorski said. The Munich Security Conference is ongoing from Feb. 14-16, with numerous Western officials and leaders present, including Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-call-to-putin-was-a-mistake-polish-fm-says/	2025-02-15T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2172451145.jpg
Official denies Ukraine will participate in Russia-US meeting in Saudi Arabia	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, denied on Feb. 15 that Ukraine will participate in an upcoming meeting between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. &quot;There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,&quot; Podolyak said on Ukrainian TV, adding that &quot;Russia is not ready for negotiations.&quot; Podolyak comments come amid conflicting reports that Russian and Ukrainian representatives are set to join senior U.S. officials in Riyadh for peace talks. Politico reported on Feb. 15, citing a Republican lawmaker and two U.S. officials familiar with the meeting, that talks between the representatives of all three countries are set to begin in the coming days. The publication later updated the story to note that a Ukrainian official confirmed to Politico that the meeting&apos;s announcement came as a surprise to Kyiv and there are no plans to send a Ukrainian delegation. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 15 that the talks in Saudi Arabia will only include U.S. and Russian officials as a means to pave the way for a potential leaders&#x2019; summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. Following a phone call he held with Putin, Trump previously said he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. Podolyak&apos;s comments seemingly echo statements made earlier in the day by Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference. &quot;We didn&apos;t talk about it. The media printed something. I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,&quot; Zelensky said. During his comments on Ukrainian TV, Podolyak said that Russia is set to use their presence at the negotiating table to secure an &quot;operational pause to reconfigure its army&quot; as well as gain leverage over the situation while attempting to ease sanctions on the country. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the details of the upcoming meetings in Riyadh amid the conflicting reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/official-denies-ukraine-will-participate-in-russia-us-meeting-in-saudi-arabia-amid-conflicting-reports/	2025-02-15T14:15:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2068280045.jpg
Senior US diplomat visits Belarus, three political prisoners released, NYT reports	U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Christopher W. Smith visited Belarus alongside two other U.S. officials in an unannounced meeting on Feb. 12, the New York Times reported, potentially ending Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s isolation from the West. Belarus has been cut off from the West following Lukashenko&apos;s crackdown on the 2020 mass protests in response to what the West denounced as fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The meeting comes as U.S. seeks to negotiate a deal with Belarusian authorities. In exchange for the release of an undefined number of political prisoners, the U.S. is willing to ease sanctions on Belarusian banks and potash, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed officials in contact with Smith on Feb. 13. Belarus is a major producer of potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer. Revealing the meeting, Smith said during a briefing on Feb. 13 that it was the goal of U.S. officials to secure freedom for more political prisoners. Alena Movshuk, a Belarusian activist, and Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist for Radio Free Europe were released, Franak Viacorka, Senior Advisor to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya said. Smith drove to Belarus from Lithuania, following a phone call with Lukashenko. The small U.S. delegation visited a border town where three political prisoners were transferred, including one U.S. citizen, and two Belarusian citizens. The Belarusian leader assured Smith he was ready to decrease repression in Belarus, Smith said, adding that the U.S. wants Belarus to be less reliant on Russia. Lukashenko was handed a seventh consecutive term as President of Belarus on Jan. 26, in an election that has been internationally denounced as a sham. Minsk refused to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s Jan. 26 presidential election.	https://kyivindependent.com/senior-us-diplomat-visits-belarus-political-prisoners-released/	2025-02-15T13:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/1238a.jpeg
As little as 1,000 Russian troops left in Transnistria, Zelensky says	Russia has greatly reduced its troop presence in Transnistria, leaving only 1,000-1,500 troops in the region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Russian-controlled Transnistria has hosted Russian forces for decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian troops have guarded the region, stalling any attempts for reintegration with Moldova. &quot;There were 5,500 or 6,000 (Russian troops), now there are far less,&quot; Zelensky said, according to Kyiv Independent journalists attending the conference. &quot;We believe that there are about 2,500 troops left there today. To be honest, I believe there are (closer to) 1,000-1,500 Russians left.&quot; Russia &quot;withdrew several thousand&quot; troops, relocating from Transnistria to aid in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Zelensky said. The Russian troops left in Transnistria no longer guard the Russian-controlled region like they did before, Zelensky added. &quot;Today they are guarding warehouses with weapons,&quot; he said. &quot;They took some of them (Russian troops) and took them out. They took them out, most likely, by plane via Chisinau,&quot; Zelensky concluded. Amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, energy security in Russian-occupied Transnistria have remained in limbo, following the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine in January. The EU recently offered financial assistance to Tiraspol, which they rejected. Russian gas deliveries to Transnistria have long been considered crucial to Russia&apos;s control over the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/only-1500-russian-troops-left-in-transnistria-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T12:49:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Trump team heading to Saudi Arabia for Ukraine-Russia peace talks, Politico reports	Senior U.S. officials are heading to Saudi Arabia for peace talks with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, Politico reported on Feb. 15, citing a Republican lawmaker and two U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. It was not immediately clear as to whether Trump will join his top officials in Riyadh. The two unnamed U.S. officials did not provide to Politico specific details about timelines for the start of negotiation. However, Mike McCaul, a Republican congressman confirmed to Politico that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will joining State Secretary in Riyadh in the coming days. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg will not be present. The official is currently at the top European security conference and is expected to visit Ukraine. Request for comment by Politico to Ukraine&apos;s government as well as the U.S. State Department went unanswered. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders attended the Munich Security Conference focused on Ukraine. During a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Zelensky said that Ukraine was &quot;ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible.&quot; &quot;We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. European officials will not be present at the upcoming peace talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials said, echoing previous statements by Kellogg. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the day, Kellogg said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-heading-to-saudia-arabia-for-ukraine-peace-talks-politico-reports/	2025-02-15T12:09:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
State Secretary Rubio holds phone call with Russia's Lavrov	U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio held a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 15, just days after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Building on the Feb. 12 phone conversation between the presidents of Russia and the United States, the foreign ministers agreed to maintain a communication channel to address accumulated issues in Russian-American relations,&quot; a readout from the Russian Foreign Ministry read. &quot;This is aimed at removing the unilateral barriers inherited from the previous administration that hinder mutually beneficial trade, economic, and investment cooperation.&quot; The conversation between the two top diplomats comes just days after a Feb. 12 phone call in which Trump agreed Putin that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; The conversation between Putin and Trump was poorly received in Kyiv, amid concern that Ukraine will be left out of peace negotiations. Zelensky took issue with Trump first holding a conversation with Putin before calling the Ukrainian president, expressing that the situation &quot;was not very pleasant.&quot; &quot;Both sides expressed a mutual willingness to engage on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine,&quot; the readout from the Russian Foreign Ministry continued. &quot;Lavrov and Rubio reaffirmed their readiness to work together to restore a mutually respectful interstate dialogue in line with the tone set by the presidents. They agreed to maintain regular contact, including preparations for a Russian-American summit.&quot; Saudi Arabia will reportedly hold a summit between Trump and Putin in Riyadh, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Feb. 14, although the dates have not yet been finalized. No additional details on the phone conversation were provided. A readout from the State Department was not immediately available. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, amid uncertainty over further U.S. support against potential Russian aggression, Zelensky called on Europe to create its own armed forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-secretary-rubio-holds-phone-call-with-russias-lavrov/	2025-02-15T11:43:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
You can't kill your way out of this war' — Kellogg calls for sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet, concessions from Ukraine to end war	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, attended a panel discussion during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15 where he called for the the U.S. to implement additional sanctions on Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; while also calling for concessions from both countries to secure a peace deal. &quot;What is driving Russia? It&apos;s really a petrol state. 70% of the money they are getting to fund this war is coming from petrol, oil and gas. Most of that is going through the shadow fleet&quot; Kellogg said at the panel discussion attended by Kyiv Independent journalists. &quot;So what does (Russian President Vladimir Putin) have to give up? Well maybe he&apos;ll give up his oil revenue and we&apos;ll force him to do it, because what you do is start employing sanctions that break the economic back,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;These are the things you can do.&quot; Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; refers to a group of oil tankers employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions. Earlier in the discussion, Kellogg said that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;When you say concessions, of course they&apos;re concessions that both sides are going to have to give,&quot; Kellogg said, without specifying what concessions the countries would have to make. &quot;If you think you&apos;re going to kill your way out of this, you&apos;re wrong, because you have a lousy view of history,&quot; Kellogg continued, noting that Russia was &quot;willing to sacrifice&quot; large number of Russian soldiers on the battlefield, invoking memories of the 700,000 Russian soldiers lost in the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II. Kellogg&apos;s remarks come as the Trump administration is trying to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he aims to end the war as soon as possible but has not outlined specific steps to do so. During the panel, Kellogg added that a &quot;comprehensive plan&quot; developed alongside allies, was needed to stop the war &#x2014; without specifying the details of what that entails. Speaking at the top European security conference earlier in the day, Kellogg said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Kellogg mentioned the Minsk II deal of 2015, which aimed to end Russia&apos;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and involved Germany and France alongside Ukraine and Russia. &quot;There were a lot of people at the table, but it didn&apos;t work out,&quot; Kellogg said. That&apos;s why Europe will not be involved in the negotiations, but its interests will be taken into account, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/you-cant-kill-your-way-out-of-this-war-kellogg-calls-for-sanctions-against-russias-shadow-fleet-concessions-from-ukraine-to-end-the-war/	2025-02-15T10:51:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2199838066-612x612.jpg
What's at stake for Poroshenko, ex-president sanctioned by Zelensky?	In an unprecedented move, President Volodymyr Zelensky imposed sanctions on his predecessor and key political rival, lawmaker Petro Poroshenko. Poroshenko, who was elected president in 2014, lost his reelection bid in 2019 to Zelensky in a bitter campaign that often included personal attacks. The rivalry between the two did not subside after the election. &quot;We are defending our state and restoring justice. Everyone who destroyed Ukraine&apos;s national security and helped Russia must be held accountable. The billions that were earned by actually selling Ukraine, Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian security must be blocked and must work to protect Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said in an evening address on Feb. 12, referring to Poroshenko, whose net worth was over $1 billion. The sanctions came as a number of Ukrainian politicians appeared to have begun election preparations following looming peace talks and a push from the U.S. Presidential candidates Volodymyr Zelensky and Petro Poroshenko during the debates at the Olimpyskiy Stadium in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 19, 2019. (Celestino Arce/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Along with Poroshenko, four more tycoons faced sanctions: oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, multimillionaire Kostiantyn Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadii Boholyubov, and Viktor Medvedchuk, a former pro-Russian lawmaker accused of high treason. Kolomoisky is now behind bars, while the others have fled Ukraine or ended up in Russia. None of them hold power in Ukraine at this time. All have been charged with a variety of crimes in the past, ranging from money laundering to high treason. The sanctions froze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and blocked them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states that the measures are indefinite. Poroshenko called the sanctions against him &quot;politically motivated&quot; and &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; The Kyiv Independent explains why Poroshenko was targeted now, what he is set to lose and what the ex-president&apos;s future might look like. Poroshenko said that, as of late January, around 130 criminal cases had been opened against him. Most of them were launched after appeals by people who were either convicted or fled to Russia, he said. That&apos;s not exactly true. Prior to the full-scale invasion, in December 2021, the former president was charged with high treason for what the prosecution said was aiding Russian-controlled militants in the occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast. He was accused of organizing the supplies of coal from Russian-occupied areas to Ukrainian companies in 2014-2015. The Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast was a heavily industrialized region and the source of the country&apos;s coal and other critical materials. If found guilty, Poroshenko could face 10 to 15 years in prison. Besides Poroshenko, the coal supplies case involves Medvedchuk, who allegedly negotiated with both Russia and its proxies, and Poroshenko administration on the coal supplies. Poroshenko has denied wrongdoing. After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, the investigation of criminal cases against the ex-president was halted. Three years later, the suspended criminal case was one of the official reasons for imposing sanctions against Poroshenko. Former President Petro Poroshenko speaks to his supporters before a court hearing at the Pechersk District Court in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2020. (STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Citing their sources in law enforcement, Ukrainian media outlets have given a variety of other reasons for Poroshenko to be punished by authorities. The reasons range from Poroshenko&apos;s political activities, like his involvement in the creation of the now-banned Party of Regions in 2000, as well as being a minister under Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in the early 2010s. Another reason given was the fact that Poroshenko was slow in selling his business in Russia and the occupied parts of Ukraine following the start of Russia&apos;s war in 2014. The Roshen factory, a confectionery plant owned by Poroshenko, in Russia&apos;s Lipetsk halted operation in 2017 and was nationalized by Russia in 2024. &quot;These are events that happened in 2000, 2010, 2014. It&apos;s ridiculous to accuse Poroshenko of creating the Party of Regions in 2000,&quot; Professor Oleksiy Haran, research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I don&apos;t want to present Poroshenko as an angel. But, unfortunately, it (sanctions) harms Ukraine&apos;s prestige abroad,&quot; he added. Zelensky also accused Poroshenko of circumventing billions from Ukraine and did not rule out that sanctions could be lifted after he &quot;returns the withdrawn funds&quot; to the budget. For years, Poroshenko was listed among the wealthiest people in Ukraine. He first became a billionaire in 2012, according to Forbes. Poroshenko and his son, Oleksiy Poroshenko, ranked third on the list in 2023 with a net worth of $954 million, according to NV media outlet. A year later, only Poroshenko&apos;s son remained in third place on the list of the richest, with a fortune estimated at $1.2 billion. Some of the former president&apos;s assets were frozen in January 2022 following treason charges. However, Poroshenko&apos;s largest businesses remained untouched. After losing the 2019 presidential election, he began transferring his assets to his son, Oleksiy. The key asset of the Poroshenko family is the Roshen confectionery, which saw a profit of Hr 5.64 billion ($135 million) in the first half of 2024 alone, according to NV.

(Joseph Sywenkyj/Bloomberg via Getty Images)According to YouControl, Petro Poroshenko remains the beneficiary of several companies, including the Kyiv-based International Investment Bank. It is unclear which of Poroshenko&apos;s assets can be affected by sanctions. Poroshenko also owned Channel 5 and Pryamyi TV channel until 2021. He sold them to his allies to avoid being labeled as an &quot;oligarch.&quot; The channels are still loyal to Poroshenko and harshly critical of Zelensky. Both channels have not been part of the Ukrainian TV marathon &#x2014; a pool of five TV broadcasters formed under the government&apos;s directive to share resources and cover the war. Channel 5 and the Pryamyi TV channel were also deprived of digital broadcasting, which some saw as a violation of freedom of speech. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that the sanctions against prominent businessmen are &quot;a reminder of the war against the oligarchs.&quot; In 2021, Zelensky&apos;s anti-oligarch laws created a register of individuals, establishing a legal definition of an oligarch. The process stalled due to the start of the all-out war and remained largely forgotten since. &quot;This is a warning to big business. That in a time of war, even inside the country, there will be tough methods for those who will launch any information or political campaigns against the government,&quot; Fesenko added. The legality of sanctions against Ukrainian citizens has always been questioned by observers. Yet, the majority of Ukrainians have backed the sanctions that were slapped on notorious figures and pro-Russian politicians. When asked, 31% of Ukrainians answered that they see sanctions against Poroshenko as an attempt to divert public attention from the difficult battlefield situation, a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed. Another 24% think that it is an attempt to &quot;neutralize the opposition&quot; before potential elections and only 27% see them as an attempt &quot;to punish actual criminals.&quot; &quot;The main problem is that this (sanctions) will be perceived as a political tool,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;It was necessary to use traditional legal mechanisms rather than sanctions. Investigation and court,&quot; he added. According to the Law on Sanctions, Ukraine can impose sanctions against foreigners and foreign entities, as well as Ukrainians who engage in terrorist activities. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Feb. 14 that investigations into Poroshenko and the other four businessmen are ongoing.

(Ruslan Stefanchuk/Facebook)&#xA0;In response to criticism from European partners, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said that sanctions against Poroshenko are &quot;in no way a substitute&quot; for the criminal cases against him. &quot;These are not political issues but legal ones. The final decisions should be made exclusively by the court, as is customary in countries with stable democracies,&quot; Stefanchuk said. According to Fesenko, sanctions could prevent Poroshenko from actively participating in political and information campaigns. At the same time, experts don&apos;t see Poroshenko as a competitor for Zelensky, given the results of multiple polls. Sanctions against him may consolidate Poroshenko&apos;s backers and harm Zelensky&apos;s popularity, but are unlikely to change this tendency, experts say. &quot;The war with Russia is not over yet, and we are starting internal political wars,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Unfortunately, Zelensky&apos;s opponents are also waging an open war against him. It is mostly informational, a little bit political. But a war is a war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/whats-at-stake-for-poroshenko-ex-president-sanctioned-by-zelensky/	2025-02-15T08:56:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1414978534.jpg
Making sense of Trump’s plan – if there is one – to end Russia’s war in Ukraine	After pledging for months to swiftly end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump has started to take first steps toward peace negotiations this week. After holding a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, Trump declared that Ukraine peace talks were to start &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; Kyiv was informed soon after. What followed was a stream of often contradictory statements from Trump&#x2019;s team about Ukraine, Russia, and the peace deal procedure, creating an impression that the new U.S. administration rushed to start peace talks without a clear plan &#x2013; if there is one. The Kyiv Independent has compiled key facts and statements to help make sense of Trump&#x2019;s priorities and vision for the negotiations that can decide Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Trump appears confident that Putin is ready for serious talks. The first known Trump-Putin call since Trump returned to office lasted 1.5 hours on Feb. 12, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Trump applauded the conversation as &#x201C;lengthy and highly productive,&#x201D; saying that both sides agreed to &quot;work together, very closely, including visiting each other&apos;s Nations.&#x201D; &#x201C;I think President Putin wants peace, and President Zelensky wants peace, and I want peace,&#x201D; Trump claimed while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 13. The comment angered Ukrainians and Ukraine supporters as Trump ignored the fact that this war of aggression was unleashed by Russia. Trump said that he would meet Putin in Saudi Arabia, but has not disclosed a date yet. When asked by reporters whether Putin could be trusted to hold an agreement on Feb. 14, Hegseth said, &quot;You don&apos;t have to trust somebody in order to negotiate with them.&quot; U.S. Vice President JD Vance speaks during the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 14, 2025 in Munich, Germany. (Johannes Simon/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s stance on UkraineTrump called Putin first on Feb. 12 before he informed Zelensky over the phone that peace talks were to begin, fueling concerns that Trump has no interest in consulting with Kyiv before making key decisions. Zelensky admitted to journalists that &#x201C;it is not very pleasant&quot; that Trump called Putin first. When asked by reporters about whether Ukraine should be an &#x201C;equal member&#x201D; of the peace talks, Trump didn&#x2019;t answer directly. &quot;It&apos;s an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed,&#x201D; Trump said. Shortly afterward, Trump reassured that Kyiv would be included in peace talks with Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. &quot;They&apos;re part of it. We would have Ukraine, and we have Russia, and we&apos;ll have other people involved, a lot of people,&#x201D; Trump told reporters in the Oval Room on Feb. 13. Zelensky said it was important that he met Trump first before Putin. So far, Kyiv has not confirmed a planned meeting with the American president yet. Trump doesn&#x2019;t appear interested in pumping much-needed military aid and humanitarian support just to help Ukraine. Trump has stressed that the U.S. should also get something in return. In the same Fox News interview where he suggested that Ukraine &#x201C;may be Russian someday,&#x201D; Trump said he asked Kyiv for &#x201C;the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that.&#x201D; &#x201C;Otherwise, we&apos;re stupid,&#x201D; Trump suggested. &#x201C;We have to get something. We can&#x2019;t continue to pay this money.&#x201D; Zelensky said that the U.S. deal on minerals doesn&#x2019;t offer any security guarantees to Ukraine, which is why Kyiv hasn&#x2019;t signed it. &#xA0; Trump has agreed with his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO accession path is not &#x201C;practical.&#x201D; &#x201C;Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it&#x2019;s unlikely or impractical. I think probably that&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; Trump said on Feb. 12. &#x201C;I think long before President Putin, they said there&#x2019;s no way they&#x2019;d allow that. This has been going on for many, many years.&#x201D; &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO, and I&#x2019;m okay with that.&#x201D; Also on Feb. 12, Hegseth said that post-war security guarantees for Ukraine &#x201C;must be backed by capable European and non-European troops&#x201D; outside the scope of NATO. &#x201C;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&#x201D; Hegseth said. Vice President JD Vance, however, said in a Feb. 13 interview with the Wall Street Journal that the possibility of Washington deploying its troops to Ukraine should Russia fail to negotiate properly was still &quot;on the table,&#x201D; hinting at a lack of coordination strategy within the White House. But shortly after the interview was published, Vance walked back from his own comments and called the coverage &#x201C;absurd,&#x201D; claiming that the Journal twisted his words. &#x201C;As we&apos;ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm&apos;s way where it doesn&apos;t advance American interests and security,&#x201D; Vance said on Feb. 14. &#x201C;This war is between Russia and Ukraine.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky gives a speech on the second day of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 15, 2025. (Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-2014 bordersTrump and his senior officials have cast doubt on the prospects of Ukraine reclaiming its territorial integrity. Ukraine may get back some of its territories but should not expect to reclaim its pre-2014 borders, Trump told reporters on Feb. 13. Hegseth called it &#x201C;unrealistic&#x201D; for Ukraine to reclaim the pre-2014 borders, which include Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region that Russia occupied in 2014. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. would also like to see a &quot;sovereign and prosperous&#x201D; Ukraine, but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&#x201D; Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that &quot;formalizing Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial losses&quot; in a potential peace deal &quot;will not equate to recognizing them.&quot; &quot;I think there will be a certain agreement on the potential loss of territory. But, look, you don&apos;t have to admit it,&quot; Kellogg said in an interview on Feb. 13 with Fox News. Though some European officials said Trump&#x2019;s rush to peace talks was partially expected, they warned that a hasty peace deal conducted over their heads would be very dangerous to European security. &#x201C;Any quick fix is a dirty deal,&#x201D; EU&#x2019;s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, stressing that there is no deal without Europe and Ukraine and accusing the U.S. of &#x201C;appeasement&#x201D; toward Moscow. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Trump&#x2019;s team publicly conceding to Moscow even before the peace talks began was &#x201C;regrettable.&#x201D; For Central-Eastern European nations and the Baltic states that have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s sudden push for peace talks with Putin is particularly alarming. &#x201C;Peace talks would need to begin at the battlefield, with Ukraine having a stronger hand, where Ukraine would be able to actually start pushing and increasing pressure on Russians,&#x201D; Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This is how some success at the negotiating table could be achieved. Now, Ukraine is not put in a stronger position, so basically, what happened (on Feb. 12) is a push for capitulation of Ukraine.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/making-sense-of-trumps-plan-if-there-is-one-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-02-15T08:44:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198945928.jpg
Ukraine 'not ready' to sign mineral resource agreement with US, Zelensky says	Ukraine is not yet ready to sign a mineral resource agreement with the United States, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a news conference at the Munich Security Conference, stating that the agreement &quot;was not ready to protect&quot; Ukraine and its interests. &quot;I did not allow the ministers to sign the agreement because, in my opinion, it&apos;s not ready to protect us, our interests,&quot; Zelensky said at a news conference attended by Kyiv Independent journalists on Feb. 15. The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the agreement after Bessent&apos;s presentation, saying he needed to study it and consult with others. &quot;It&apos;s important to talk about investments in Ukraine and this needs to be closely examined by legal experts. We can consider how to distribute the profits (from the mineral resource agreement) if it is tied to a security agreement,&quot; Zelensky added. The proposed agreement, which Zelensky referred to earlier as &quot;a memorandum,&quot; was not a security agreement, Zelensky added. &quot;There are no security guarantees,&quot; in the proposed agreement, Zelensky said, adding that signing the agreement &quot;was not in our interest today.&quot; For a mineral resource agreement to be signed, Ukraine would need to know that the agreement would work, be a positive one for both countries, as well as bring profit and security for Ukraine, Zelensky added. &quot;These resources are not mine, they are of our people,&quot; Zelensky concluded. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-ready-to-sign-mineral-resource-agreement-with-us-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T08:41:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06318------.jpg
Europe won't participate in peace negotiations, but its interests to be considered, Kellogg says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Kellogg&apos;s remarks come as the Trump administration is trying to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he aims to end the war as soon as possible but has not outlined specific steps to do so. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Kellogg mentioned the Minsk II deal of 2015, which aimed to end Russia&apos;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and involved Germany and France alongside Ukraine and Russia. &quot;There were a lot of people at the table, but it didn&apos;t work out,&quot; Kellogg said. That&apos;s why Europe will not be involved in the negotiations, but its interests will be taken into account, he added. Kellogg also stressed that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end even this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; in 180 days to try to achieve this. Kellogg said that Trump &quot;will not give up important interests,&quot; adding that the U.S. will continue to help Ukraine, but &quot;the killing must be stopped.&quot; Moscow and Kyiv engaged in direct negotiations in Belarus and Turkey during the early months of the full-scale invasion, but those talks ultimately failed. No formal direct discussions between the two sides have taken place since then. Trump has tasked his own delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead negotiations. The Kremlin has repeatedly emphasized that it views the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in efforts to end the war. Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-wont-participate-in-negotiations-but-its-interests-to-be-considered-kellogg-says/	2025-02-15T07:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russia must withdraw to at least pre-2022 front line, Zelensky says	Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 in an interview with Newsmax. Zelensky&apos;s comments come after earlier in the week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Ukraine was unlikely to restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Zelensky told Newsmax that U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia&apos;s war if Europe supports his plan. &quot;I think that he (Trump) needs, very much, the success, and, otherwise, everybody will say that (this) was the line of Biden and this is the line of Trump. I think he needs success, and we need success and trust him. I hope that he will be on our side,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump has repeatedly pledged to swiftly end the war in Ukraine although he never presented a plan for achieving that. On Feb. 12, Trump held separate calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky. Trump called Putin first, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Zelensky stressed that a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war,&quot; which should be agreed upon between Ukraine and the U.S. president and backed by both sides. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after a joint plan with Trump and the European Union was developed. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion, further occupying territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as partially occupying territories in Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-must-withdraw-to-at-least-pre-2022-front-line-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T07:14:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198893921.jpg
Europe quietly developing plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, AP reports	A group of European countries is quietly developing a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine due to concerns about changing U.S. priorities on security on the continent, The Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. The news came amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire agreement is reached between Ukraine and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly said it wouldn&apos;t send its troops to Ukraine, pushing for Europe to take initiative. France and Britain are leading the initiative of putting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevklur told the Associated Press that European allies are &quot;in a very early stage&quot; of developing the plan to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Pevklur said that it is &quot;critical&quot; for the allies to understand the contact line in Ukraine before devising a plan. According to Pevklur, if the Russian and Ukrainian armies reduce their forces to a &quot;couple of thousand&quot; on each side, it will not be a problem for Europe &quot;to also be there.&quot; But implementing the plan will be much harder if there is a &quot;boiling conflict.&quot; Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-quietly-developing-plan-to-send-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine-ap-reports/	2025-02-15T06:30:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/1_GettyImages-2149875923.jpeg
Ukraine, Germany agree to open 'Unity Hub' for Ukrainian refugees in Berlin	Ukraine&apos;s National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov and German Federal Minister for Special Tasks Wolfgang Schmidt signed a joint declaration on Feb. 15, agreeing to open Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Unity Hubs&quot; in Berlin. &quot;The signing of the Joint Declaration of Intent to open the Ukrainian &apos;Unity Hub&apos; in Berlin is an important step to support our citizens abroad. This is a professional space that brings together community, business, and cultural initiatives,&quot; Chernyshov said. The declaration was signed at the Munich Security Conference as the German government continues to debate the legal status and benefits for Ukrainian refugees in the country. The hub will provide Ukrainians with access to educational and career opportunities both in Ukraine and in the host country, according to Chernyshov. The initiative also aims to help Ukrainian refugees adapt, learn, and develop their initiatives in the host country. Meanwhile, the hub will also provide assistance to those who want to return to Ukraine. Germany has taken in more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees since the start of the full-scale invasion, spending over 20 billion euros ($21.4 billion) on their accommodation and integration, according to Bloomberg. More than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have already found jobs in Germany through the government&apos;s Jobturbo program, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a conference with citizens and voters of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Teltow. According to Eurostat, over 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees are currently registered for temporary protection to legally access housing, find work, and receive social benefits in EU states. The EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-germany-agree-to-open-ukraines-unity-hub-in-berlin/	2025-02-15T05:20:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/tempImagefZ4JkJ.gif
Almost 250,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine war, Zelensky says	The Russian army has lost almost 250,000 soldiers in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky claimed that Moscow lost nearly 20,000 soldiers in the battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. In addition, a total of over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the president. Zelensky&apos;s estimate of Russian losses matches that of the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. According to the military, Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since 2022. &quot;We completely destroyed the North Korean units that (Vladimir) Putin had to bring in because his own forces weren&#x2019;t enough to hold back our counteroffensive,&quot; Zelensky said, speaking of Ukraine&apos;s Kursk operation. &quot;For over six months now, Ukrainians have been holding a foothold inside Russian territory, even though it was Russia that wanted to create a &apos;buffer zone&apos; inside our land,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky previously said that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-lost-almost-250-000-soldiers-in-war-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-02-15T04:16:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151581445-1.jpg
Putin is weak. We must use that' — Zelensky's Munich speech in 5 key quotes	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speech on the second day of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15 was met with several rounds of applause. The Ukrainian president called for the creation of an &quot;army of Europe&quot; and emphasized the changes in relations between Europe and the U.S. during Donald Trump&apos;s second presidential term. Zelensky also said that it would be possible to stop Russia&apos;s war and Russian President Vladimir Putin if Europe is united. Zelensky&apos;s speech comes after Trump&apos;s call with Putin, in which they discussed a peace deal for Ukraine without first consulting with Kyiv. Trump made it clear that he doesn&apos;t see Ukraine as an equal party in the negotiations, while Europe might not be invited to the table at all. In response to recent statements from Trump&apos;s team saying that Ukraine&apos;s future in NATO is unrealistic, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO &quot;is not off the table.&quot; The Kyiv Independent has picked out five key quotes from Zelensky&apos;s speech at the Munich Security Conference. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest &#x2014; now we can&apos;t rule out the possibility that America might say &apos;no&apos; to Europe on issues that threaten it. Many leaders have talked about a Europe that needs its own military &#x2014; an Army of Europe. I believe that the time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created. This is not harder than standing firm against Russian attacks &#x2014; as we have already done. But this isn&apos;t just about increasing defense spending as a GDP ratio. Money is needed, yes &#x2014; but money alone won&#x2019;t stop an enemy assault.&quot; &quot;Does America need Europe? As a market, yes. But as an ally? For the answer to be &apos;yes,&apos; Europe needs a single voice &#x2014; not a dozen different ones. A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over &#x2014; when America supported Europe just because it always had. But President Trump once said: What matters is not the family you were born into, but the one you build. We must build the closest possible relationship with America, and &#x2014; yes, a new relationship &#x2014; but as Europeans, not just as separate nations. That&apos;s why we need a unified foreign policy, a coordinated diplomacy, the foreign policy of a common Europe.&quot; &quot;Europe has everything it takes. Europe just needs to come together and start acting in a way that no one can say &apos;no&apos; to Europe, boss it around, or treat it like a pushover.&quot; &quot;Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.&quot; &quot;Look at what Putin is trying to do. This is his game. Putin wants one-on-one talks with America &#x2014; just like before the war, when they met in Switzerland and looked how to carve up the world. Next, Putin will try to get the U.S. President to stand on Red Square on May 9th &#x2014; this year &#x2014; not as a respected leader, but as a prop in his performance. We don&apos;t need that.&quot; &quot;We are already working to ensure that on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, we can gather together in Kyiv and online. All European leaders. All key partners who defend our security. From Spain to Finland. From Britain to Poland. From Washington to Tokyo.This meeting must deliver a clear vision for our next steps on peace, security guarantees, and the future of our collective policy.&quot; &quot;I also will not take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table. But right now, the most influential member of NATO seems to be Putin because his whims have the power to block NATO decisions. And that&apos;s despite the fact that it was Ukraine&apos;s army that stopped Russia &#x2014; not a NATO country, not NATO troops, but only our people and army. I am proud of Ukraine. I am proud of our people. But now, I ask you &#x2014; each of you &#x2014; to honestly answer this question: If Russia came for you, could your army fight the same way? I don&apos;t want anyone to ever have to find out &#x2014; God forbid. That&apos;s why we are talking about security guarantees. And that&apos;s why we believe that the core of any security guarantees for Ukraine must be NATO membership. Or &#x2013; if not that &#x2013; then conditions that allow us to build another NATO right here in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We must apply pressure together to make real peace. Putin cannot offer real security guarantees. Not just because he is a pathological liar but because Russia, in its current state, needs war to hold power together. And the world must be protected from that. So, first, the Armed Forces of Europe as an upgrade to NATO. Second, a common European foreign policy. Third, the level of European cooperation that Washington has to take seriously. Fourth, international law. And fifth, keeping all pressure on Russia because that pressure is what guarantees peace, not Putin&apos;s words, not just some papers. Putin lies. He is predictable. And he is weak. We must use that &#x2014; now, not later.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-munich-speech-in-5-key-quotes/	2025-02-15T03:55:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199020267.jpg
US wants to get 50% of Ukrainian minerals, may deploy its troops to guard them, NBS reports	The U.S. seeks to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare minerals and has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard them if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, NBC reported on Feb. 15, citing unnamed American officials. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Zelensky refused to sign the agreement after Bessent&apos;s presentation, saying he needed to study it and consult with others, NBC reported, citing eight U.S. officials briefed on the meeting. At the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that his lawyers would examine the document handed over by Bessent in Kyiv and make some changes to it. He called the U.S. proposal &quot;a memorandum,&quot; not a security agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wants-to-get-50-of-ukrainian-minerals-signals-openness-to-deploying-american-troops-to-guard-them-nbs-reports/	2025-02-15T02:30:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Zelensky calls for creation of 'army of Europe' amid US support uncertainty	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Europe to create its own armed forces amid uncertainty over further U.S. support against potential Russian aggression. &quot;Let&apos;s be clear: We cannot rule out the possibility that America may refuse to cooperate with Europe on issues that threaten it,&quot; Zelensky said on Feb. 15 during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. &quot;Many leaders have talked about Europe needing its own army. An army of Europe. I really believe that the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created,&quot; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-for-creation-of-army-of-europe-amid-us-support-uncertainty/	2025-02-15T01:50:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06815------.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 12 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three and injured 12 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 15. Russian forces launched 70 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, as well as from Cape Chauda in occupied Crimea, at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 33 drones over Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 37 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia sends them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 35 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and 10 others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked the town of Preobrazhenka with glide bombs, killing a 50-year-old woman and a 47-year-old man. Their bodies were retrieved from under rubble, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. A 74-year-old woman was also injured in the attack against Huliaipole as Russian forces struck the town with glide bombs. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the attack against the village of Novodmytrivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-3-injure-12-over-past-day/	2025-02-15T00:36:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-15-09_45_18.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 856,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 15. This number includes 1,180 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,068 tanks, 20,927 armored fighting vehicles, 37,379 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,174 artillery systems, 1,283 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,067 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 25,341 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-856-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-14T23:33:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2023644061.jpg
No point trying to negotiate' with Putin, Yulia Navalnaya says	There is &quot;no point trying to negotiate&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Navalnaya&apos;s comments come two days before the anniversary of her husband&apos;s death, which coincided with the launch of the 2024 Munich Security Conference. As U.S. and Ukrainian officials gathered in Europe to discuss steps towards negotiating an end to Russia&apos;s war, Navalnaya warned against attempting to make agreements with Putin. &quot;Even if you decided to negotiate with Putin, just remember he will lie,&quot; she said. &quot;He will betray. He will change the rules at the last moment and force you to play his game.&quot; Days before this year&apos;s Munich Security Conference began, U.S. President Donald Trump held separate calls with both Putin and President Volodymyr Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Trump has repeatedly promised to strike a deal with Moscow that brings about a swift end to the war in Ukraine. &quot;There are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin,&quot; Navalnaya said. &quot;If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement. If he loses power, the agreement will become meaningless.&quot; Navalnaya, who has emerged as a prominent leader in the Russian opposition movement in the wake of her husband&apos;s death, spoke at a conference panel along exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Tsikhanouskaya added that supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression would help other countries, including Belarus and Moldova. &quot;By helping Ukraine, you&apos;re helping the whole region,&quot; she said. Alexei Navalny died on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in northern Russia, after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Navalnaya has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue his political work. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny&apos;s death. While Navalnaya is an outspoken critic of Putin&apos;s government, she has expressed ambivalence on military support for Ukraine, commenting in October 2024 that &quot;it&apos;s difficult to say&quot; whether Kyiv should receive weapons, because &quot;the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-point-trying-to-negotiate-with-putin-yulia-navalnaya-says/	2025-02-14T21:34:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199669519.jpg
Drone strike causes blaze at Russian industrial site in Kaluga Oblast, governor claims	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone strike overnight on Feb. 15 caused a fire at an industrial facility in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, regional Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) crashed into an unspecified industrial site, the governor claimed. &quot;On the territory of an industrial enterprise in the Dzerzhinsky district, as a result of a UAV crash, a fire broke out in one of the buildings,&quot; Shapsha said. Emergency workers were dispatched to the scene, and preliminary reports indicate there are no casualties, Shapsha said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Shapsha&apos;s claims at the time of publication. While Shapsha did not specify the facility that came under attack, the Dzerzhinsky district is home to Russia&apos;s Pervyy Zavod plant, the largest petrochemical enterprise in Kaluga Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported a successful attack on the facility in May 2024. Last month, the Ukrainian military struck an oil depot in the town of Lyudinovo in Kaluga Oblast, causing a fire on the premises. A number of other regions in Russia reported drone strikes on the night of Feb. 15. A drone attack in the southern Russian city of Volgograd reportedly targeted an oil refinery and hit an apartment building, according to local residents. Russian officials have not commented on a possible attack. Roman Busargin, the governor of Saratov Oblast, also reported a drone threat in the region. The Russian Defense Ministry reported on Feb. 15 that 40 UAVs had been shot down over Kaluga, Volgograd, Saratov, and Rostov oblasts during the night. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these reports. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particlarly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-causes-blaze-at-russian-industrial-site-in-kaluga-oblast-governor-claims/	2025-02-14T20:38:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187953056.jpg
Drones hit apartment building, target oil refinery in Volgograd, Russian media says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Multiple drones targeted an oil refinery near the city of Volgograd in southern Russia in the early hours of Feb. 15, Russian Telegram channels reported. Local residents reported hearing over 15 explosions during a drone attack, according to the Telegram channel Shot. The reports claimed that the drones were headed towards an oil refinery in the Krasnoarmeysky district of the city. Following reports of explosions, the Telegram channel Astra reported that a drone struck a multistory residential building in Volgograd. Local residents said that security forces had cordoned off the site and that preliminary information indicated no one was injured. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack and no casualties have been reported. The Volgograd refinery, owned by Russian oil giant Lukoil, was recently struck by Ukrainian drones in an attack on Jan. 31, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The facility has been targeted multiple times throughout the full-scale war. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities as valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-hit-apartment-building-target-oil-refinery-in-volgograd-russian-media-says/	2025-02-14T19:40:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1245921994.jpg
Zelensky, Macron discuss Europe's role in Ukraine's security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed steps towards ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in a phone conversation on Feb. 14. The call followed Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference. The two leaders discussed how European partners can coordinate with the U.S. and Ukraine to bring about a just peace, the Presidential Office reported. &quot;Europe must be represented at the negotiating table,&quot; Zelensky reportedly emphasized to Macron. According to the Presidential Office, the call focused particularly on &quot;security guarantees and proposals of France.&quot; While the president did not disclose the details of these proposals, Zelensky and Macron have previously discussed France&apos;s idea of deploying Western peacekeepers to monitor a future ceasefire in Ukraine. While Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s preferred postwar security guarantee is NATO membership, U.S. leadership has severely undercut that aim in the past few days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12 that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. He also said that a return to the country&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;an unrealistic objective.&quot; Later that day, U.S. President Donald Trump said he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin directly about negotiations to end the war. Trump called Zelensky some time after his talk with Putin. European officials were reportedly caught off guard by Trump&apos;s direct engagement with Putin, with key allies receiving no prior notice, according to Bloomberg. Zelensky and Macron reportedly discussed the conversation with Trump in their latest call. &quot;If President Trump can truly convince President Putin to stop the aggression against Ukraine, that is great news,&quot; Macron said on X after speaking with Zelensky. &quot;Then, it will be the Ukrainians alone who can drive the discussions for a solid and lasting peace. We will help them in this endeavor.&quot; Zelensky thanked Macron for championing the idea of &quot;nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The security of the whole of Europe in the future depends on unity now,&quot; the Presidential Office said. Many European leaders have reiterated their ongoing support for Ukraine amid Trump&apos;s push for a swift deal to end the war. Still, some allies in Europe fear that they will have to shoulder the economic and security burdens of Ukraine&apos;s postwar recovery as the U.S. and Russia exclude them from talks on ending the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-discuss-europes-role-in-ukraines-security-guarantees/	2025-02-14T18:55:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1241348238.jpg
It doesn't advance American interests' — JD Vance walks back WSJ comments on US troops in Ukraine	U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 14 reiterated that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;is between Russia and Ukraine&quot; and accused the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of &quot;twisting (his) words&quot; in a recently published interview. Vance told the WSJ on Feb. 13 that the U.S. had &quot;military tools of leverage&quot; it could potentially use to pressure Russia in negotiations to end the war. When asked if the possibility of U.S. troops in Ukraine was &quot;officially off the table,&quot; Vance replied that in negotiations with President Donald Trump, &quot;everything is on the table.&quot; In a post on X the following day, Vance walked those comments back and called the WSJ&apos;s coverage &quot;absurd.&quot; &quot;President Trump is the ultimate deal maker and will bring peace to the region by ending the war in Ukraine,&quot; Vance wrote. &quot;As we&apos;ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm&apos;s way where it doesn&apos;t advance American interests and security. This war is between Russia and Ukraine.&quot; Vance appeared to take issue with the WSJ interview&apos;s headline, which read &quot;Vance wields threat of sanctions, military action to push (Russian President Vladimir) Putin into Ukraine deal.&quot; Even though Vance did not rule out the possibility of military leverage in future negotiations and refused to say deploying U.S. troops was off the table, he accused the outlet of &quot;twisting (his) words.&quot; Vance lashed out at the publication further, claiming without evidence that the WSJ has &quot;spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas.&quot; The Vice President&apos;s remarks came on the same day that he led a U.S. delegation in talks with &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference. The leaders discussed a potential minerals agreement between Washington and Kyiv, which could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued U.S. military and financial support. Before the meeting, Vance delivered an excoriating address to the conference attendees in which he suggested progressive European policies were a greater threat to the EU than Russia. His speech downplayed the threat of authoritarian states and touted the value of far-right political parties. A few days before the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the U.S. would not send troops to Ukraine. Kyiv&apos;s Western allies have discussed the possibility of deploying peacekeeping forces as a potential security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-doesnt-advance-american-interests-jd-vance-walks-back-wsj-comments-on-us-troops-in-ukraine/	2025-02-14T17:53:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
Ukraine's survival hinges on US military support, Zelensky tells NBC News	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that his country faces an uphill battle for survival without continued U.S. military assistance. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, he told NBC News that it would be &quot;very, very, very difficult&quot; for Ukraine to sustain its fight against Russia and remain secure in the long term without American support. Zelensky stressed that while Ukraine would always fight for its survival, the chances of success would be significantly diminished without help from the United States. During the interview with NBC&#x2019;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Zelensky also dismissed the idea of negotiating a ceasefire on Russian terms, arguing that Moscow&#x2019;s goal is to gain time to rebuild its military strength. He warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks a temporary truce to ease international sanctions and prepare for renewed aggression. &quot;This is really what he wants,&quot; Zelenskyy said, emphasizing that any pause in fighting could allow Russia to reinforce its forces. His remarks come amid growing tensions between the U.S. and its European allies over support for Ukraine. At the Munich summit, U.S. Vice President JD Vance took a combative tone, criticizing European leaders on multiple fronts, including issues unrelated to the war. In response, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier accused the Trump administration of undermining long-standing partnerships. The widening rift has raised concerns in Europe about the future of Western unity against Russia. Meanwhile, Trump&#x2019;s recent statements on Ukraine have unsettled many European leaders. Trump also downplayed criticism from within his party, telling reporters that he had not heard concerns from Senator Roger Wicker, who recently called U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth&#x2019;s comments on Ukraine a &quot;rookie mistake.&quot; &quot;I&#x2019;ll speak to Roger. I&#x2019;ll speak to Pete. I&#x2019;ll find out,&quot; Trump said. Despite the shifting U.S. stance, Zelensky remains hopeful that Washington will not abandon Kyiv. He said earlier that he does not believe the U.S. has a concrete plan for peace and insisted that Ukraine must be included in any negotiations between Washington and Moscow. Speaking at the Munich conference, he suggested that Trump could exert pressure on Putin if he chose to stand firmly with Ukraine. &quot;And if he will choose our side, and if he will not be in the middle, I think he will pressure and he will push Putin to stop the war. He can do it,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-survival-hinges-on-us-military-support-zelensky-tells-nbc-news/	2025-02-14T16:53:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Russia arrests US citizen at Moscow airport over alleged cannabis-laced sweets	A 28-year-old U.S. citizen was detained at Moscow&#x2019;s Vnukovo airport after Russian authorities allegedly found food items containing cannabis derivatives in his luggage. The man had arrived from Istanbul on Feb. 7 when a customs inspection led to his arrest, according to Russian state-run news agencies TASS and Interfax. Russia&#x2019;s Federal Customs Service claimed that a service dog alerted officials to one of the man&#x2019;s suitcases, prompting a search. Inside, authorities reportedly discovered two plastic jars and a zip bag containing sweets. A chemical analysis later confirmed that the items contained narcotic substances from the cannabinoid group, TASS reported. The detained traveler reportedly told officials that the gummies and marmalade had been prescribed to him by a doctor in the United States. He claimed he needed the products while traveling, according to TASS. The possession of cannabis, even for medical use, is illegal in Russia. The U.S. State Department has not yet commented on the case. The detention comes amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Russia, including previous high-profile detentions of American citizens. Earlier this week, Russia and the U.S. carried out a prisoner exchange, with Moscow releasing U.S. teacher Marc Fogel in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national accused of Bitcoin fraud. Fogel had been sentenced to 14 years in prison for carrying marijuana he claimed was medically prescribed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-arrests-us-citizen-at-moscow-airport-over-alleged-cannabis-laced-sweets/	2025-02-14T15:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Ukraine secures return of 8 children from Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully brought back eight children who had been forcibly taken to Russian-occupied territory, Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, reported on Feb. 14. &quot;Among the returned children are siblings,&quot; Lubinets wrote. &quot;All the children were separated from their families due to the war and occupation, and some lost their parents. In general, we managed to return children from Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblast.&quot; Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; Lubinets estimated that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Ukrainian children return home on Feb. 14 as part of the Ukrainian President&apos;s initiative Bring Kids Back UA. (Dmytro Lubinets / Facebook)Ukraine considers these abductions a war crime and argues that they meet the U.N.&apos;s legal definition of genocide. Russia often claims it is relocating children to protect them from conflict zones. According to the Ministry of Reintegration, the government has managed to return 388 children so far. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&apos;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot; A Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3 detailed Russia&apos;s systematic program of deporting and forcibly assimilating Ukrainian children. Under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, children were transported via military aircraft in 2022, reclassified in Russian databases as native-born, and subjected to pro-Russian re-education before being adopted into Russian families. Ukrainian children had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-8-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2025-02-14T14:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/478155332_3485103575130744_747462514348261219_n.jpg
JD Vance's Munich speech met with shock, bewilderment, and 'almost no applause'	U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned those watching on Feb. 14 when his speech at the Munich Security Conference turned into a searing attack on Europe&apos;s ideals and a call to embrace far-right political parties. At an event focused almost entirely on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Vance said what he fears most isn&apos;t authoritarian states but Europe&apos;s &quot;threat from within.&quot; &quot;The threat I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it&apos;s not China, it&apos;s not any other external actor. It is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.,&quot; he said. Vance went on to admonish Europe for not paying enough attention to &quot;uncontrolled migration&quot; and for what he described as the &quot;retreat&quot; of free speech. He argued that Europe should not &quot;just talk about democratic values&quot; but &quot;live them,&quot; adding the continent could not &quot;force people what to think, what to believe.&quot; Vance said these efforts included restrictions on &quot;misinformation,&quot; which he described as a &quot;Soviet-era&quot; word, and laws against abortion protests that he said unfairly silenced Christians. Speaking a little over a week before the German elections, the vice president called on European nations to drop their opposition to far-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which Berlin suspects of extremism. &quot;If you are afraid of your own people, there is nothing America can do for you,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.&quot; The speech stunned those in attendance &#x2014; Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said in a post on X the speech amounted to &quot; the total humiliation of all European leaders.&quot; &quot;There was almost no applause,&quot; he added in another post. US Vice President Vance just spoke. The only thing that can be said about Vance&apos;s speech was the total humiliation of all European leaders. People in the room are shocked. For most of Vance&apos;s speech, the European leaders and bureaucrats looked at each other, and there was almost no applause. &quot;It&apos;s a strange style,&quot; EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told the Kyiv Independent at the conference, adding: &quot;Of course, he attracted a lot of attention, but (there were) no substantial messages. Not on Ukraine, not on Gaza.&quot; Kubilius added that he was &quot;not surprised&quot; at the speech, adding it was now a question of how Europe reacted to it. &quot;And my reaction is quite simple &#x2014; keep calm and carry on,&quot; he said. Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent that Vance&apos;s comments &quot;risk creating a fracture between the U.S. and Europe at a time when unity at all levels is essential to counter Russia (and) ensure a strong transatlantic alliance and continued support for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Rather than using the prestigious MSC&#x2019;s stage to promote the image of the new U.S. administration in front of European leaders... the U.S. vice president decided to openly downplay a very tangible Russian threat in front of an audience comprising people from countries that suffered decades of brutal Soviet occupation and directly criticize European countries and their governments... for their alleged attack on democracy and freedom of speech,&quot; Borsari noted. The expert also highlighted that Vance&apos;s comments were promptly praised by members of the far-right AfD. Elsewhere, social media was awash with criticism of the speech &#x2014; Gideon Rachman, the chief foreign affairs commentator for the Financial Times (FT), described it as &quot;shocking hypocrisy.&quot; Shocking hypocrisy from Vance - lecturing Europe on democracy when he serves as vice president to a man who attempted a coup in the US Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the speech was &quot;significantly worse than expected.&quot; The #MSC2025 speech by &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; VP Vance was significantly worse than expected. At best it was totally irrelevant to European or global security concerns. At worst it was blatant interference in the &#x1F1E9;&#x1F1EA; election campaign in favor of far-right AfD. pic.twitter.com/4IKknWhoR8 Speaking at the conference after Vance&apos;s speech, Germany&apos;s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius tackled the vice president&apos;s comments about the AfD head-on. &quot;Democracy does not mean that a vociferous minority can decide what truth is&#x2026; democracy must be able to defend itself against extremists,&quot; he said. German Defense Minister Pistorius reacts to Vance&apos;s speech: &quot;This is not acceptable.&quot; pic.twitter.com/LdVuLC6PbU Vance later met with President Volodymyr Zelensky. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, also attended the meeting. &quot;Our teams will continue to work on the document (on critical minerals). We have addressed many of the key issues and look forward to welcoming General Kellogg to Ukraine for further discussions and a deeper assessment of the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We are ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible. We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. I wonder if JD Vance is planning to lecture his boss&#x2019;s buddy Vladimir Putin on democracy and free speech. &#x1F914; Vance&apos;s speech came at the end of a tumultuous week for U.S.-Europe relations and the future of the war in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and his top officials on Feb. 12 appeared to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s leverage in peace talks, renewing fears that his plans for a quick resolution could amount to a victory for Russia. Trump announced he had held phone calls with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Zelensky, saying peace negotiations would start &quot;immediately&quot; and a ceasefire is in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; Earlier in the day, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said &quot;returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,&quot; and that NATO membership for Ukraine is not an option. JD Vance says Putin isn&apos;t Europe&apos;s biggest threat less than 24 hours after Putin hits Chernobyl with a drone. You can&apos;t make this stuff up. European leaders &#x2014; suddenly left out of discussions after nearly three years of close involvement with the U.S. on Ukraine-related issues under President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration &#x2014; &#xA0;scrambled to react to Trump&#x2019;s comments. Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, said on the same day: &quot;Why are we giving (Russia) everything they want, even before negotiations have started? &#x2026; If there is an agreement made behind our backs, it simply will not work.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vances-munich-speech-met-with-shock-bewilderment-and-almost-no-applause/	2025-02-14T14:15:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06752------.jpg
Senior Republican senator calls Hegseth’s Ukraine remarks 'rookie mistake,' Politico reports	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker after suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s return to its pre-war borders was &quot;unrealistic.&quot; While Hegseth has since walked back some of his comments, Wicker, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, argued in an interview with Politico that the damage was done, saying: &quot;He made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he&#x2019;s walked back some of what he said but not that line.&quot; The controversy stems from Hegseth&#x2019;s initial remarks, in which he also said that NATO membership for Ukraine was off the table and that reclaiming its internationally recognized borders was not feasible. His comments were met with backlash, particularly from Wicker, who speculated on their origins, saying, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know who wrote the speech &#x2014; it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool.&quot; Wicker said he was surprised by Hegseth&#x2019;s initial remarks but heartened by his partial reversal. &quot;Everybody knows &#x2026; and people in the administration know you don&apos;t say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won&apos;t agree to,&quot; Wicker added, noting that he found Hegseth&#x2019;s statements puzzling and disturbing. The criticism of Hegseth is also tied to broader diplomatic moves by the Trump administration. President Donald Trump held a call this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war, while Vice President JD Vance was set to meet with &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky in Munich. Trump later reinforced Hegseth&#x2019;s message, stating that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership was not &quot;practical&quot; and that a return to pre-2014 borders was &#x201C;unlikely.&#x201D; The direct talks between Trump and Putin have raised concerns among European allies that Ukraine could be sidelined in any potential peace agreement. In contrast, Wicker maintained a hardline stance, calling Putin a &quot;war criminal who needs to be in prison for the rest of his life.&quot; He also pushed back against Trump&#x2019;s suggestion that NATO enlargement provoked Russia&#x2019;s invasion, stating unequivocally that Russia alone was responsible. &quot;There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,&quot; Wicker said. &quot;They invaded, contrary to almost every international law, and they should be defeated. And Ukraine is entitled to the promises that the world made to it.&quot; Trump, however, denied being aware of Wicker&#x2019;s criticism from within his own party. When asked about it on Feb. 14, he said: &quot;Roger is a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he&#x2019;s been doing a great job. I haven&#x2019;t heard.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x2019;ll speak to Roger. I&#x2019;ll speak to Pete. I&#x2019;ll find out,&quot; after asking the reporter to clarify Wicker&#x2019;s remarks. Despite the internal Republican divide, Wicker continued to push for sustained U.S. military aid to Ukraine, calling for continued weapons shipments &quot;until there is a ceasefire.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/senior-republican-senator-calls-hegseths-ukraine-remarks-rookie-mistake-politico-reports/	2025-02-14T13:30:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161853322.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Chornobyl Nuclear Plant sarcophagus hit by Russian drone; Zelensky sets out condition for talks with Putin	Key developments on Feb. 14: A Russian attack drone struck the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th reactor at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Feb. 14. The strike damaged the sarcophagus, but the fire was extinguished and radiation levels remained stable, according to the president. Monitoring efforts continue to assess any potential risks. &quot;This is a terrorist threat to the entire world,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that the damage to the shelter is significant. &quot;The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today&apos;s Russia.&quot; The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the explosion. The organization reported that a drone struck the shelter&apos;s roof. Chornobyl, the site of the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster, remains a highly sensitive location. The explosion of the plant&apos;s reactor on Apr. 26, 1986, contaminated a vast area spanning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The sarcophagus was installed over the 4th reactor in the aftermath of the disaster to contain the uranium, plutonium, and radioactive dust at the site. The protective structure would only last 30 years, with the construction of a new sarcophagus completed in 2017. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).&quot;Ukraine is urging the international community to urgently intensify efforts in response to Russia&apos;s unprecedented act of nuclear terrorism. The attack on the shelter of the 4th power unit at Chornobyl poses a threat to the entire continent,&quot; said Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Zelensky said the attack underscores Russia&apos;s continued disregard for global security. &quot;Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations &#x2014; he is preparing to continue deceiving the world,&quot; he said. Russia attacked the station&apos;s protective shelter on the day of the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky is leading Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic strategy for ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&apos;s office, said Ukraine would provide the U.S. with detailed information on Russia&apos;s attack on Chornobyl&apos;s protective shelter. Ukraine is not talking about any peace deal now, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. &quot;Today, we are not talking about any peace agreement. Frankly to say, it is unfortunate,&quot; Zelensky said.&quot;The war has been going on for three years, there have been many deaths, much has been destroyed, especially lives. All this was brought by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and him alone.&quot; The president said that Ukraine needs the firm support of the U.S. and a &quot;strong&quot; President Donald Trump, who will be on Kyiv&apos;s side. According to Zelensky, a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war&quot; which should be agreed between Ukraine and the U.S. president, and backed by both sides. He also reiterated the importance of Europe&apos;s role in the potential deal. &quot;A peace deal cannot be signed in Munich because it is Munich. We remember what things were signed here. I do not repeat such things,&quot; Zelensky added, recalling the infamous Munich meeting when Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy came to an agreement that allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. &quot;I am ready to meet only in this case. And we will sit down with Putin and stop the war,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia is possibly preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. While the buildup could focus on Ukraine, he cautioned that Russian forces might shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. &quot;Based on all the information I&apos;ve gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war against NATO countries next year,&quot; Zelensky said, but added he &quot;can&#x2019;t be 100 percent certain.&quot; &quot;Just like in 2022, they could move forward towards Ukraine, or they could go to Poland or the Baltics. And I believe this is his idea,&quot; he said. &quot;God bless, we will stop this crazy guy,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also warned that without NATO membership, Ukraine must build a self-sufficient military capable of defending its sovereignty. &quot;This means the appropriate NATO weaponry and a sufficient number of our Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; he said. According to Zelensky, Ukraine would require an army numbering 1.5 million soldiers. Last month, he said the current total of those serving in Ukraine&apos;s armed forces was 880,000. North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said the morale of Pyongyang&apos;s troops had been &quot;broken&quot; by the losses, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. &quot;We understand that their losses are more than four thousand. I think two-thirds have died,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky also said 2,000-3,000 more troops are being transferred from North Korea to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, saying it was important that U.S. President Donald Trump takes note of such developments as he tries to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. Quantum Systems, a German drone manufacturer operating two plants in Ukraine, plans to double its drone production in the country, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Ministry announced on Feb. 14. The company produces advanced Vector reconnaissance drones. It opened its first facility in Ukraine in April 2024. Unmanned systems have become a key capability for both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war. to meet its battlefield needs, Kyiv has ramped up domestic production and imports of drones since the start of the full-scale invasion. The ministry met with Quantum Systems representatives at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 to discuss ways to speed up drone production. &quot;We all want the same result &#x2014; more quality weapons for the Ukrainian military,&quot; said Herman Smetanin, Ukraine&apos;s strategic industries minister. The ministry wrote that Quantum Systems operates an R&amp;D center and a drone maintenance and development facility in Ukraine, calling it &#x201C;a good example of localized manufacturing.&quot; Ukraine War Latest is put together by the Kyiv Independent news desk team, who keep you informed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

We're ready to move to real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible' — Zelensky on meeting with Vance	A Ukrainian delegation led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with representatives of the U.S. government, including U.S. Vice President JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. The meeting was initially postponed, allowing the U.S. time to review a draft memorandum of partnership submitted by Kyiv, a source in the Zelensky&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent. Following the meeting, Zelensky thanked Vance and his team. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, also attended the meeting. &quot;Our teams will continue to work on the document (on critical minerals). We have addressed many of the key issues and look forward to welcoming General Kellogg to Ukraine for further discussions and a deeper assessment of the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We are ready to move towards real and guaranteed peace as quickly as possible. We sincerely appreciate President Trump&apos;s determination to help stop the war and provide Ukraine with justice and security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky added. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Ukraine finalized and handed over the memorandum to the U.S. side, which requested additional time to review the document until 5 p.m. The draft memorandum is part of broader discussions on a potential minerals agreement, which Trump has suggested could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued military and financial support. Zelensky has expressed openness to such an arrangement, saying that Ukraine is willing to grant U.S. companies access to minerals in exchange for sustained support from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-ready-to-move-to-real-and-guaranteed-peace-as-quickly-as-possible-zelensky-on-meeting-with-vance/	2025-02-14T11:28:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-14-20_52_43.jpeg
Over 150 Ukrainian war prisoners may be held in Chechnya, Kyiv says	More than 150 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) may be held in Chechnya, Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Feb. 14. Ukraine has documented over 100 cases of Russia summarily executing Ukrainian POWs since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets clarified that the actual number is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence, such as videos of the executions. Some 36 Ukrainian POWs are being sought and may be in the city of Grozny, Chechnya, according to the headquarters. The Red Cross International Committee has not confirmed that there are any Ukrainians in captivity in Chechnya. The headquarters are also not aware of any visits by the humanitarian organization to Ukrainian POWs in Chechnya, as reported by RFE/RL. Ukrainian soldiers are captured in different sectors of the frontline, and then they are transferred to Chechnya, the headquarters said. &quot;As in other places of detention on the territory of the aggressor state and the Ukrainian occupied territories, the norms of humanitarian law and the requirements of the Third Geneva Convention related to the treatment of POWs are not observed,&quot; the organization said. &quot;(Chechen dictator Ramzan) Kadyrov&apos;s regime uses prisoners as human shields for military facilities, as well as a lever to lift sanctions against members of the Kadyrov family.&quot; Ukraine has not received any requests from Chechnya for the exchange of POWs, the headquarters added. In 2024, 1,358 Ukrainians were released, and since the beginning of the all-out war, 3,956 Ukrainians have returned from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his New Year&apos;s address.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-150-ukrainian-war-prisoners-may-be-in-chechnya-ukraine-says/	2025-02-14T11:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2024-05-06-22_22_13.jpg
Over 6,000 cases of Russian use of chemicals recorded over 2 years, Ukraine says	Ukraine has recorded 6,129 cases of the use of munitions containing hazardous chemicals by Russian troops since February 2023, the Foreign Ministry reported on Feb. 14. Russia has been intensifying its use of chemical agents on the battlefield in Ukraine. Since the beginning of the all-out war, Ukraine&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units have been monitoring and recording the use of hazardous chemicals in attacks. For a recent report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), experts analyzed the materials provided by Ukraine, including four Russian RG-Vo type gas grenades, as well as soil and grass samples. Two OPCW laboratories confirmed that they contained riot control agent known as CS. Among other hazardous chemicals, chloroacetophenone (CN), as well as chloropicrin and mercaptans (malodorants) were found, according to the statement. By using them, Russia violates Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Foreign Ministry said. &quot;The international community must demonstrate its unity in countering the aggressor, and a practical element of this should be the establishment of an international coalition to hold the Russian Federation accountable for the violation of its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; the statement read. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said in December 2024. Ukraine struck back at Russia&apos;s use of illegal chemical weapons on Dec. 17, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) assassinated Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops. The previous day, Ukrainain prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-6-000-cases-of-russias-use-of-chemical-weapons-have-been-recorded-in-2-years-ukraine-says/	2025-02-14T11:03:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2152456898.jpg

The firm also established a service, support, training, and logistics center in Ukraine in the following year. The company promised to supply Kyiv with 500 reconnaissance drones by the end of 2024. In September 2024, Ukraine created the Unmanned Systems&apos; Forces &#x2014; a separate branch of the military focused on drones, forming special drone-specific units, and improving the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-drone-manufacturer-quantum-systems-plans-to-double-production-in-ukraine/	2025-02-14T10:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/Vector-.jpeg
‘Nuclear blackmail:’ Russia strikes Chornobyl as world leaders gather for Munich Security Conference	Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear power plant on Feb. 14 just as world leaders gathered for the Munich Security Conference &#x2014; in Moscow&#x2019;s latest nuclear threat against Kyiv. Videos shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky show a drone breaking through Chornobyl&#x2019;s &#x201C;sarcophagus,&#x201D; an international project to cover reactor number four that exploded in 1986 in the most devastating nuclear disaster in history. Zelensky called the drone attack &#x201C;a terrorist threat to the whole world.&#x201D; Without going into details about the attack, a representative for the Chornobyl station called the strike an &#x201C;act of terror by Russia.&#x201D; The strike is likely more signaling on Russia&#x2019;s part. The Munich Security Conference, historically a show of force by NATO, started on Feb. 14. Andriy Yermak, the head of the president&#x2019;s office, wrote, &#x201C;The atmosphere (at Munich) right now is such that everyone in Munich is very angry because of this news.&#x201D; Images of the attack released by Ukraine&#x2019;s security service show that Russia used a long-range Shahed attack drone in the strike, but that damage was limited. The president said that following the attack, higher radiation levels were not detected. &#x201C;It&apos;s a tiny warhead in the drone,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffman, a missile expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, of the explosion visible in photos. &#x201C;(Russia) very much knew that this would absolutely not penetrate the meter-thick concrete walls surrounding the reactor, so they knew there would be no radiation leakage,&#x201D; he said. The sarcophagus surrounding the derelict reactor is not the only defense. &#x201C;The blocks also have this concrete shell that gets in the way of some kind of large-scale projection of radioactive waste,&#x201D; said Olena Lapenko, an energy security specialist at the Dixi Group, a Kyiv-based energy think tank. &#x201C;We understand, and they understand, that a single drone is not going to get through to the center of the nuclear block.&#x201D; 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).As negotiations to end the war pick up steam, Russia may be flexing its muscles. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky on the phone this week, saying peace talks would start &quot;immediately&quot; and that a ceasefire was in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also came out this week saying that both a return to Ukraine&#x2019;s 2014 borders and NATO accession were unrealistic. The statement caused alarm that the U.S. was making concessions to Russia before negotiations had even begun. Zelensky connected the attack to negotiations, saying, &#x201C;Russia carries out such attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure and our cities every night. Russia continues to increase its army. Russia does not change its crazy anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations.&#x201D; &#x201C;There&#x2019;s this wave of information regarding negotiations. I would not rule out that this (attack) is to put pressure on Ukraine,&#x201D; says Lapenko, who called the attack &#x201C;a new wave of nuclear blackmail.&#x201D; The engine reportedly from a Russian drone that struck the protective shelter of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation / Telegram)Moscow has deployed various forms of nuclear saber-rattling since the start of the full-scale invasion. It has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons to deter Ukraine&#x2019;s allies from assisting it further. In the early days of the invasion, Russian troops occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant &#x2014; Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear facility &#x2014; effectively using it as a military base. After nearly three years of campaigns against Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system, Russia also began targeting the infrastructure near the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants last year, putting their connection with the energy grid at risk. While Ukraine has gotten better at protecting its energy facilities since the attacks began, the strikes against nuclear-connected infrastructure represent a &#x201C;change in tactics,&#x201D; says Lapenko. As Russia struggles with ramping up its missile attacks against Ukraine, it may be looking for any avenue it can to ratchet up the pressure on Kyiv, said Hoffman. &#x201C;From a Russian perspective, you really want to bring home this message that Russia still has tools to increase the suffering of the Ukrainian people if they don&apos;t settle this conflict soon.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/nuclear-blackmail-russia-strikes-chornobyl-as-munich-security-conference-kicks-off/	2025-02-14T09:52:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Gjuo632XYAAqUi6-2.jpeg
Saudi Arabia ready to host proposed Trump-Putin summit	Saudi Arabia supported the proposal to hold a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Riyadh, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Feb. 14. The statement came days after Trump held separate calls with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders can meet in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;The Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) expresses its welcome to hosting the summit in Saudi Arabia, and reaffirms its ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; the ministry said. Saudi Arabia hosted an international summit on the peace formula in August 2023. The country has also played an important role in negotiating prisoner exchanges with Russia. At the same time, Riyadh has maintained close economic ties with Moscow, which have strengthened following the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Russia&apos;s subsequent economic isolation from the West. The extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the U.S.-Russia talks remained unclear. President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that he is planning to visit Saudi Arabia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates to discuss other topics such as children kidnapped by Russia. Zelensky and Trump also agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Ukraine&apos;s president also said that he was ready to meet with Putin only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending of Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-arabia-says-its-ready-to-host-trump-putin-summit/	2025-02-14T09:43:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2068280045.jpg
Ukraine needs 1.5 million-strong army in absence of NATO membership — Zelensky on alternative security guarantees	If Ukraine does not join NATO as part of a peace deal, it will need Western support to maintain an army of 1.5 million soldiers as deterrence agains a future Russian invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters on Feb. 14 at the Munich Security Conference. The remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty around possible alternative workable security guarantees for Ukraine given the reluctance of some NATO members to invite Ukraine to join the alliance. Previously floated ideas have included the presence of European troops on the ground in Ukraine, but without an open signal from Washington backing the idea, little progress has been made. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter what country these forces are from. In any case, we need 1.5 million troops if we are not in NATO,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If we really want not to be afraid of a new occupation or a new Russian invasion, these are real security guarantees. (Vladimir) Putin will know that he has a 1.5 million army, and Ukraine has a 1.5 million army. If he wants to come and die (in Ukraine), he is welcome to do so,&quot; Zelensky added. Ukraine currently has 110 combat brigades, while Russia has 220, according to Zelensky. &quot;So, we need 220,&quot; he added. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-a-1-5-million-army-if-we-are-not-going-to-be-in-nato-zelensky-on-ukraines-membership-in-alliance/	2025-02-14T09:34:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSC06354------.jpg
Editorial: America is folding. Europe, will you step up?	The U.S. administration is ready to hand Russia a win in its brutal war against Ukraine. That&#x2019;s the only conclusion we can make after following the news this week. If anyone held onto hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump would be tough on Russia&#x2019;s Vladimir Putin, sorry to disappoint you. As the week unfolded, the world watched as Trump and his team &#x2014; a group of people who pride themselves on being artful dealmakers &#x2014; threw away any possible leverage they may have had over Russia. They brought Putin back to the table, took NATO off of Ukraine&#x2019;s, and said a return to pre-invasion borders was unrealistic. &#xA0; In other words, they gave Moscow exactly what it wanted before the negotiations even started. Here in Ukraine, that means we only have one hope remaining &#x2014; we need you, in Europe, to step up. The U.S. president seems to have made it his goal to indulge his Russian counterpart at every possible turn. He called Putin before Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, clearly showing his preference. He praised the Russian dictator and the &#x201C;great nation&#x201D; of Russia. He also promised Putin a meeting. Perhaps most notably, Trump refused to call Ukraine an equal partner in peace negotiations, and blamed Ukraine for &#x201C;going into the war,&#x201D; as if it was Ukraine&#x2019;s choice. He also demanded access to Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, trying to use a battered ally&#x2019;s vulnerability to take something away from it. All of this happened ahead of the Munich Security Conference. There, on its first day, U.S. Vice President JD Vance offered no clarity on Trump&#x2019;s plans regarding the war, instead taking the stage to lecture the already anxious European allies about democracy. Watching it all happen from Ukraine was especially devastating. Being at the epicenter of the storm, having lived through three years of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war and all that comes with it, we now have to watch as Russia is about to not just get away with all of its crimes, but be rewarded for them. There is little use in trying to understand Trump and his team&#x2019;s words and actions now. They went beyond appeasement. Russian politicians, media, and public figures are loudly gloating and praising Trump, understandably so. We know very well that Trump and his team aren&#x2019;t speaking for all Americans. At the Kyiv Independent, we have a front-row seat in seeing how many regular Americans support Ukraine and donate to Ukrainian causes, including backing our publication. They are true supporters of justice and democracy, and there are plenty of them. However, the U.S. president is acting in their name, too. Trump&#x2019;s words and actions signal a change of course that is bleak for Ukraine and the free world. He acts like he isn&#x2019;t just going to let Russia win the war but is ready to help it win. So, is this it? No. Even the leader of the world&#x2019;s most powerful country can&#x2019;t single-handedly decide the outcome of this war. America may be the biggest and richest ally Ukraine has, but it&#x2019;s far from the only one. That means that, of course, all the eyes are on you, Europe. The real decision on whether Russia wins the war doesn&#x2019;t actually sit with Trump now &#x2014; it&#x2019;s with Europe. The EU and the U.K. have shown that they are capable of standing up to Russian aggression and backing Ukraine. Now they need to find the resolve to lead, not be led. The people of Europe need to demand from their leaders to speak up and step up, to counter the conceding direction taken by the U.S. administration. A good example of leadership was set by the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who on Feb. 13 reiterated that Ukraine was on &#x201C;irreversible path to NATO&#x201D; and said it has to be &#x201C;at the heart&#x201D; of any peace discussions, countering the points of Trump and his team. Other leaders, including Germany&#x2019;s Olaf Scholz and France&#x2019;s Emmanuel Macron, have to join suit. If they truly have their people&#x2019;s interests at heart, and are real leaders of their nations and not political opportunists, they need to recognize the urgency of the situation, and act now. After all, if the U.S. is out, and Ukraine falls, Europe will be left to face Russia one-on-one. Almost exactly three years ago, when the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine was clearly coming, we called upon the world to stand up to Russia. Here&#x2019;s what was at the core of our call back then: &#x201C;This is not just about Ukraine. It&#x2019;s a clash of two worlds, two polar sets of values. If Putin wins, your world loses. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow &#x2013; but soon, and unquestionably.&#x201D; Those worlds are still true today. Russia isn&#x2019;t at war with Ukraine, it&#x2019;s at war with the West. And if a significant part of the West deserts, the rest needs to make sure to show up for battle. Nobody wants this war to end more than Ukrainians do. It&#x2019;s our homes that get attacked with drones every night. It&#x2019;s our friends who get killed in battle. It&#x2019;s our youth that&#x2019;s been stolen by this war. But we understand that any compromise with Russia won&#x2019;t be the end of the war. There can&#x2019;t be a compromise in this war. Russia wins &#x2013; the West loses. The West wins &#x2013; Russia loses. Europe, the time is now.	https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-america-folding-europe-will-you-step-up/	2025-02-14T09:16:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2161909058.jpg
10 Ukrainian drone makers to watch	In the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has almost certainly become the largest producer of drones in the Western-aligned world. Early workshop tinkering on mainly commercial Chinese drones evolved into steadily more professional and massive production of domestic unmanned aerial systems (UAVs). The industry&#x2019;s rapid growth has given Ukraine a fighting chance against a much bigger enemy, making drones a source of national pride. &#xA0; Details on the drone industry and its producers are hard to come by. Russia constantly targets weapons factories and even drone executives personally. But some drone makers are already clearly big businesses. Based on knowledge both publicly and privately sourced, the Kyiv Independent has assembled a list of makers ranging from mass-produced first-person view (FPV) drones to highly secretive deep-strike UAVs that we believe to be the biggest game in town. Going forward, many of these drone makers hope to sell their wares abroad once export controls are lifted, or the war comes to an end. Those looking to sell abroad are keen to headline non-lethal drone models like intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) or cargo drones, which face fewer restrictions than those more clearly designed to blow things up. Here are 10 of Ukraine&#x2019;s drone makers to look out for, in no particular order: Taking its name from a paradise in pre-Christian Slavic mythology, Vyriy produces what one long-time drone pilot describes as the best FPV he&#x2019;s ever worked with, the Molfar. The small and cheap Molfar has been in use since at least the start of 2023. For massive &#xA0;FPV makers, what&#x2019;s tricky is producing swarms that function reliably. By reputation, Vyriy manages as well as anyone. Molfar drone. (Vyriy Drone / Facebook)The firm is working to onshore production but cites a continued financial dependence on Chinese components that afflicts the drone industry worldwide. Notably, Vyriy&#x2019;s drones operate on low-frequency channels. Prior to 2022, most drones ran on 2.4 or 5.8 gigahertz (GHz) communications. Those channels are easily jammed by Russian electronic warfare systems at the front, so many operators, including Vyriy, have lowered their frequencies to under 1 GHz, which transfers less data but goes further and is harder to both jam and detect. Despite keeping a lower profile among its fellow major Ukrainian drone makers, Skyfall has brought production to a massive scale since launching in June 2022. Skyfall&#x2019;s most beloved model is the Vampire, which first became famous under the name Russian soldiers have for it, the Baba Yaga, named for a fairytale witch. The moniker is due to the drone&#x2019;s ability to run night missions, particularly while bearing payloads of up to 15 kilograms &#x2014; over five times the standard for FPVs.

(Pablo Miranzo / Anadolu via Getty Images)One of Skyfall&#x2019;s biggest selling points is nocturnal navigation. It&#x2019;s a feature largely enabled by thermal cameras like those produced by Ukrainian company Oko (which means &#x201C;eye&#x201D; in Ukrainian), and one that has proved especially effective as many Russian units reportedly lack night-vision goggles. In drone footage from a Shrike &#x2014; Skyfall&#x2019;s smaller FPV model &#x2014; shared with the Kyiv Independent by a Ukrainian drone pilot, a Russian truck stands out clearly from the treeline it is hiding inside before the Shrike hurtles into its grill before the signal turns to static. Data from government contracts show the Shrikes selling for a little over Hr 13,000 in 2024, or about $320, making them some of the cheapest quadrocopters being purchased en masse inside of Ukraine. TAF is possibly the largest-scale manufacturer of FPV drones in Ukraine today, producing some 40,000 drones per month. Its output is valued at over $1 billion per year, according to Forbes Ukraine. TAF&#x2019;s drones are fairly standard cheap quadrocopters that flock over the front line in Ukraine. TAF emerged from a charity fund run by now-CEO Oleksandr Yakovenko, which was already producing drone parts to be assembled by soldiers by early 2023. TAF&#x2019;s surge in production over the past year has been quite stunning. Kolibry 7. (TAF)If true, 40,000 a month would account for about a third of the 1.5 million drones that the Defense Ministry said Ukrainian makers shipped to the frontline in 2024. One billion dollars in orders would be a similarly massive fraction of Ukraine&#x2019;s total drone budget &#x2014; approximately $2.5 billion in 2025, not including money that individual brigades raise in donations. By many accounts the archetypical Ukrainian drone maker, UkrSpec dates back to 2014, when it was founded in response to Russia&#x2019;s initial annexation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas. UkrSpec has produced many models over the years, but almost exclusively of the highly engineered repeated-use variety &#x2014; specifically intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Shark, long-range ISR drone. (Nazar Korovai / Wikimedia)The Shark is a long-range ISR drone that largely set the standard for the genre within Ukraine. The &#x201C;People&#x2019;s Drone,&#x201D; or PD-2, is similar but can carry cargo up to 8 kilograms &#x2014; in theory, anything including a few artillery shells &#x2014; with a range of up to 1,300 kilometers. Avia Atlon is another firm that dates back to 2014. Its bread-and-butter model is the Furia, a long-range recon drone that the firm began exporting abroad prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. They were selling the Furia for just over $100,000 in 2022, per the accounting of local charity Come Back Alive. The most recent Furia model is a massive ISR drone that resembles a white manta ray and is specially designed to scout targets from up high for Ukrainian artillery. Ukrainian 24th brigade&apos;s A1-S Furia UAV. (Wikimedia)Far cheaper is Avia Atlon&#x2019;s Hrim, also known as Silent Thunder, which is a smaller kamikaze drone that remains more intricate than the average FPV drone of its class as it depends on a reusable quadrocopter for liftoff. Another of the founding fathers of what would become Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime drone boom, UkrJet shares some overlap in leadership with UkrSpec. Unlike UkrSpec, UkrJet is most famous for its actual explosive models. Its Bobr, or &#x201C;Beaver,&#x201D; was the first of Ukraine&#x2019;s major deep-strike drones, flying up to 1,000 kilometers inside of Russia. UAV Bober. (Defense of Ukraine / X)UkrJet is a project of Oleksandr Chendekov, who a competitor referred to as &#x201C;the father of the Ukrainian drone.&#x201D; Chendekov was chief technology officer at UkrSpec, UkrJet, and today, at Airlogix. Registered in 2021, UkrJet started public production of its attack drones in 2022, in the months following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Terminal Autonomy is a relatively low-profile, internationally owned, Ukraine-based firm that nonetheless ships upwards of 1,000 of its AQ 100s and an unknown number of its deep-strike AQ 400s each month. At $30,000 and a range of 750 kilometers, the AQ 400s are likely the cheapest long-distance strike drones on the market. To cut costs, their drones are made of plywood. AQ 400 Scythe kamikaze drones in an undisclosed location in Dec. 2023. (Terminal Autonomy)The similarly wooden AQ 100s are kamikaze drones, likewise designed to be deployed en masse, affordably. In addition to wooden frames, their fixed-wing design means they only need a single motor, unlike quadrocopters which, while more maneuverable, require four. The largest traditional aircraft maker in Ukraine, Antonov is often overlooked in considerations of drone manufacturers. Given its standing ties to Ukraine&#x2019;s government-owned weapons makers, it had little reason to advertise. Among drones, Antonov is most notable for its &#x201C;Lyuty&#x201D; drone, a long-range model roughly analogous to the Iranian-made Shaheds that Russia sends into Ukraine nightly. Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike drones are typically tightly held secrets within Ukraine&#x2019;s drone programs. But Russian sources frequently identify Lyuty drones as those striking local oil infrastructure. Screenshot from a video allegedly showing the launch of AN-196 Lyuty. (X)Long a government-owned defense manufacturer, Antonov formally transitioned into a private holding in April 2024. Its ties to Ukraine&#x2019;s Soviet-descended, state-owned defense conglomerate, UkrOboronProm, remain well-established. The pricing on a single Lyuty comes in at just under $200,000 a unit. Airlogix is a large-scale drone maker that has seen massive growth since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Pre-2022, Airlogix launched with a hefty cargo drone. After Russia&#x2019;s invasion, they militarized their production. Their GOR model is an ISR drone that boasts four-hour flight times and sells for some $200,000 a piece, founder and CEO Vitalii Kolesnichenko told the Kyiv Independent. Airlogix drone. (Airlogix)Kolesnichenko says Airlogix has quintupled sales of the GOR in the past year, reaching 500 units shipped in 2024, which adds up to about $100 million. Other sources say that Airlogix is also working on a deep-strike drone, but Kolesnichenko would not comment on details. Skyeton&#x2019;s Raybird is a hyper-advanced ISR drone whose latest models boast max flight times of 28 hours. A Raybird system, which includes three separate drones, sells for over $1 million a piece. Total battlefield usage remains a mystery as military acquisitions are secret, but public records show Ukrainian emergency responders buying at least five of those systems since the start of the full-scale invasion.

The firm at the time claimed that the Ukrainian military was only contracting 50 of their drones annually, lamenting that internal production could have reached 100.	https://kyivindependent.com/10-ukrainian-drone-makers-to-watch/	2025-02-14T09:11:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/drones_KI.png
Director of popular Ukrainian online casino detained over company ties to Russia	Ukraine&#x2019;s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) has detained the director of popular online casino Pin-Up over its alleged Russian ownership and business in Russia, the agency announced in a press release on Feb. 14. An ongoing investigation into the company earlier found that its real owners were Russian citizens. The owners allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of Pin-Up&#x2019;s users, including Ukrainian military personnel. In early December, the SBI announced that it suspected the beneficial owners and top managers of Pin-Up of collaborating with Russia. According to Ukrainian law adopted in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, companies owned by Russia or Russian citizens can no longer operate in Ukraine and are subject to sanctions or confiscation by the state. The SBI did not name the director in its press release, but said he is being detained on suspicions of &#x201C;aiding the aggressor state.&#x201D; According to Ukrainian monitoring service Opendatabot, Pin-Up Ukraine is owned by a company called Ukr Game Technology, and Oleksii Popenko serves as its director. During the investigation, Pin-Up was found to have ties to both representatives of Russia and entities subject to sanctions in Ukraine, and continued allowing access to its site in Russia, and in Russian-occupied territories. The SBI also said that a &#x201C;person who controls the online casino&#x2019;s work&#x201D; has been financing an organization that helped Russian veterans who fought in Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war. In May, the Pecherskyi Court in Kyiv seized the accounts of Pin-Up&apos;s online casino. It later approved the transfer of over Hr 2.6 billion ($62.5 million) of the company&apos;s seized assets to Ukraine&apos;s Asset Recovery and Management Agency. The pre-trial investigation is ongoing, and other involved parties are being identified, the SBI said in its Feb. 14 press release. Gambling was officially banned in Ukraine in 2009 until its legalization in 2020. The negative impacts of gambling, especially on the Ukrainian soldiers, became a topic of public discussion in the spring of 2024 as a petition demanding restrictions on online gambling reached the president&apos;s table in March. On April 20, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree restricting online gambling and banning it for military personnel during martial law.	https://kyivindependent.com/director-of-popular-ukrainian-online-casino-detained-over-company-ties-to-russia/	2025-02-14T08:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149356635.jpg
Peace deal can't be signed in Munich' — Zelensky sets out condition for talks with Putin	Ukraine is not talking about any peace deal now, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. &quot;Today, we are not talking about any peace agreement. Frankly to say, it is unfortunate,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;The war has been going on for three years, there have been many deaths, much has been destroyed, especially lives. All this was brought by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and him alone.&quot; The president said that Ukraine needs the firm support of the U.S. and a &quot;strong&quot; President Donald Trump, who will be on Kyiv&apos;s side. His remarks came days after Trump held separate calls with Putin and Zelensky. Trump called Putin first on Feb. 12, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; According to Zelensky, a peace deal &quot;can only be about a plan to end the war&quot; which should be agreed between Ukraine and the U.S. president, and backed by both sides. He also reiterated the importance of Europe&apos;s role in the potential deal. &quot;A peace deal cannot be signed in Munich because it is Munich. We remember what things were signed here. I do not repeat such things,&quot; Zelensky added, recalling the infamous Munich meeting when Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy came to an agreement that allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. Zelensky said he was ready to meet with the Russian president only after there is a joint plan with Trump and the EU. &quot;I am ready to meet only in this case. And we will sit down with Putin and stop the war,&quot; Zelensky said. A day earlier, Kremlin claimed that Russia has started forming a group for talks with the U.S., including on the war with Ukraine. Zelensky and Trump also agreed to begin working toward ending Russia&apos;s war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-deal-cant-be-signed-in-munich-zelensky-sets-out-condition-for-talks-with-putin/	2025-02-14T08:19:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2194672448.jpg
NATO member turning pro-Russia? Inside Slovakia’s political turmoil	Slovakia, a landlocked country on Ukraine&#x2019;s western border, is undergoing a dramatic political shift under Prime Minister Robert Fico. Once a staunch supporter of NATO and the EU, Slovakia has now moved toward a pro-Russian stance, halting military aid to Ukraine and opposing EU sanctions against the Kremlin. As Fico meets with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and cracks down on opposition voices at home, protests are erupting across the country. Tens of thousands of Slovaks have taken to the streets, fearing that their democracy is at risk.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-member-turning-pro-russia-inside-slovakias-political-turmoil/	2025-02-14T07:40:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Bratislava-Report--3-.jpg
Russia abandons modernization of power plants due to lack of money, equipment, media reports	The Russian government has allowed several companies to abandon the modernization of over a dozen power plants across the country due to a lack of funding and equipment, Russian news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 14, citing an order published on the governmental website the day prior. Though Russian officials have largely dismissed the impact of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, warning signs about the state of Russia&apos;s economy continue to mount coming into 2025. Tatneft Thermal Power Plant in Nizhnekamensk was removed from the list of modernization projects, and its renovation was postponed until 2027. Avtozavodskaya and Quadra combined heat and power plants, located in Nizhny Novgorod and Voronezh oblasts, respectively, were also excluded. Reasons for the decision included rising equipment prices, which would threaten the company&apos;s financial stability, and the recognition that the project was not profitable due to the cost of turbines, according to the document. Russia&apos;s Territorial Generation Company No. 2 , which supplies Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Kostroma, Novgorod, and Yaroslavl oblasts, was allowed not to renovate its power plants in Kostroma and Yaroslavl due to financing difficulties. The company originally planned to obtain funds for the projects from Russia&apos;s Alfa Bank but was unable to agree on loans, the news agency reported. The Russian government approved the modernization project&apos;s abandonment of the Nevinnomysskaya Condensing Power Plant in Stavropol Krai, the cost of which had reportedky risen by 454%. Russia&apos;s Siberian Generating Company was also relieved of requirements to modernize four power plants in Siberia. The company will have to pay about 2 billion rubles ($22 million) for the projects to be phased out. The Second Generation Company of the Wholesale Electricity Market, owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom, was also released from its obligations to renovate its power plant in the city of Surgut due to a 16-month delay in equipment deliveries. Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg&apos;s T Plus was also allowed not to modernize the plants he owned in Izhevsk and Samara. The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-government-allows-companies-not-to-modernize-power-plants-due-to-lack-of-money-equipment-media-reports/	2025-02-14T07:28:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197181481.jpg
Putin assembling veteran negotiators for talks on ending Ukraine war, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is assembling a team of veteran negotiators to engage with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s representatives in potential talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 14, citing sources familiar with the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Feb. 13 that Moscow has begun forming a delegation for negotiations with the United States, following a phone call between Putin and Trump. Putin&apos;s team will reportedly include Yuriy Ushakov, his longtime foreign policy aide and former Russian ambassador to the U.S.; Sergey Naryshkin, director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); and Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close associate of Putin&apos;s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova. Ushakov has been involved in Russian diplomatic efforts for decades and participated in previous negotiations with Ukraine in 2022. Dmitriev has played a role in diplomatic exchanges, including the recent release of American teacher Marc Fogel from Russian detention, according to Reuters. Naryshkin, a longtime Putin ally who first met the Russian leader in the KGB in the 1980s, has headed the SVR since 2016 and was also part of Russia&apos;s 2022 negotiations with Ukraine. Other members of the Kremlin&apos;s 2022 negotiating team may later join, with Putin&apos;s aide Vladimir Medinsky potentially playing a role in talks involving Ukrainian representatives, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Moscow and Kyiv engaged in direct negotiations in Belarus and Turkey during the early months of the full-scale invasion, but those talks ultimately failed. No formal direct discussions between the two sides have taken place since then. Trump has tasked his own delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead negotiations. The Kremlin has repeatedly emphasized that it views the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in efforts to end the war. Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-war-negotiation-team-reportedly-includes-foreign-policy-aid-intelligence-chief/	2025-02-14T05:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198662707.jpg
Ukraine opens criminal cases against ex-President Poroshenko, sanctioned oligarchs, businessmen	Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Feb. 14 that criminal proceedings have been opened against businessmen and former high-ranking officials recently sanctioned by the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC). The list includes oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, billionaire Konstantin Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadiy Boholyubov, Ukraine&apos;s 5th President Petro Poroshenko, and former pro-Russian lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk. &quot;Each of these five individuals is being held criminally liable for committing serious and especially serious crimes,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said in a post on Telegram. Poroshenko was charged in 2021 with high treason and aiding terrorist organizations for allegedly conspiring with Russian-backed separatists between November 2014 and January 2015. The scheme reportedly generated over Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in profits from coal supplies. He said the decision to impose sanctions against him was politically motivated and unconstitutional. Medvedchuk faces charges of high treason and violations of war laws, accused of helping Russia seize a Ukrainian oil and gas field in the Black Sea&apos;s Kerch Shelf. He is also accused of passing secret military information, including the locations of Ukrainian military units, and creating a pro-Russian influence network in Ukraine. Kolomoisky is under investigation for embezzling over Hr 5.36 billion ($129 million) from a financial institution and laundering nearly Hr 4.1 billion ($99 million). He is suspected of orchestrating the contract killing of a legal company director who refused to annul a decision regarding a shareholders&apos; meeting. Zhevago is suspected of embezzling $113 million and misappropriating Hr 608 million ($15 million) from a Ukrainian bank through a conspiracy with bank officials. This illegal transfer of funds to offshore accounts caused major financial losses to the institution. He is also under investigation for involvement in a criminal organization and money laundering. Boholyubov is being investigated for illegal possession of another person&apos;s passport and organizing an unlawful border crossing with the help of a border guard. He is wanted by Ukrainian authorities for his role in aiding illegal border crossings. The sanctions freeze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and block them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states that the measures are indefinite.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-opens-criminal-cases-against-ex-president-poroshenko-sanctioned-oligarchs-businessmen/	2025-02-14T05:05:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2182521653.jpg
Ukraine repatriates 757 bodies of fallen soldiers	Ukraine brought back the bodies of 757 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War announced on Feb. 14. The bodies were recovered from the Pokrovsk, Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia sectors of the front. The operation to recover the bodies involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In December 2024, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 503 fallen soldiers, mostly from Donetsk Oblast. Last month, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 757 soldiers from several oblasts.President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repatriates-757-bodies-of-fallen-soldiers/	2025-02-14T04:28:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/2025-02-14-14_24_28.jpg
Zelensky warns of Russian military buildup, potential NATO threat in 2026	Russia is preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference in Munich on Feb. 14. Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus. While the buildup could focus on Ukraine, he cautioned that Russian forces might shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. &quot;Based on all the information I&apos;ve gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war against NATO countries next year,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It&apos;s just a large group. And I&apos;m not sure this group will move towards Ukraine.&quot; In a Feb. 12 interview with The Guardian, Zelensky underscored that Europe&apos;s security depends on Ukraine&apos;s continued resistance to Russian aggression. According to Zelensky, Ukraine fields 110 brigades, while Russia has 220 brigades and plans to expand to 250 this year. Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades. Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas, the president said on Jan. 15	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russian-military-buildup-potential-nato-threat-in-2026/	2025-02-14T03:31:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Orban sees Russia's 'reintegration' into world economy, Europe's energy after Ukraine deal	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Feb. 14 that Russia would be reintegrated into the world economy and Europe&apos;s energy system once a peace deal is reached in the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported. &quot;If the U.S. president comes and creates peace, there is a deal, I think Russia will be reintegrated into the world economy... the European security system and even the European economic and energy system, that will give a huge boost to the Hungarian economy,&quot; Orban said. &quot;We will win a lot with a peace deal,&quot; he added. The Hungarian prime minister&apos;s comments follow Trump&apos;s Feb. 12 call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders reportedly spoke for 90 minutes, and Putin invited Trump to Moscow. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly leader, has consistently opposed sanctions on Moscow and criticized military aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war. Trump also announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia. Asked whether Ukraine would be part of the negotiations, Trump later told reporters, &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; Orban has previously called on the EU to lift sanctions on Russia, arguing they harm European economies more than Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-rejoin-global-economy-europes-energy-system-after-russia-ukraine-peace-deal-orban-says/	2025-02-14T03:19:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/viki.jpg
4,000 North Korean casualties in Russia's Kursk Oblast, 2/3 killed, Zelensky says	North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said the morale of Pyongyang&apos;s troops had been &quot;broken&quot; by the losses, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. &quot;We understand that their losses are more than four thousand. I think two-thirds have died,&quot; he added. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Zelensky&apos;s claim of the number killed is significantly higher than a Jan. 13 estimate from &#xA0;South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) which said at least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded. Zelensky also said 2,000-3,000 more troops are being transferred from North Korea to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, saying it was important that U.S. President Donald Trump takes note of such developments as he tries to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. According to Budanov, North Korean soldiers attack &quot;almost without any combat vehicles.&quot; Budanov also suggested that the North Korean military is so willing to advance on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery because of its loyalty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He added their disregard for personal safety makes Ukraine&apos;s defense more challenging.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-000-north-korean-casualties-in-kursk-oblast-2-3-killed-zelensky-says/	2025-02-14T03:11:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Zelensky-Vance meeting postponed as US reviews Ukraine's partnership draft	Editor&apos;s note: This story has been updated with a comment from President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference has been postponed to allow the U.S. time to review a draft memorandum of partnership submitted by Kyiv, a source in the Zelensky&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 14. The postponement comes as the U.S. considers a proposed minerals agreement that could link future aid to Ukraine with access to its rare earth mineral reserves. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a draft of the agreement to Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 12. Ukraine finalized and handed over the memorandum to the U.S. side, which requested additional time to review the document until 5 p.m. During his press conference, Zelensky confirmed that the meeting with Vance would take place later in the day. The draft memorandum is part of broader discussions on a potential minerals agreement, which U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested could involve access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral reserves in exchange for continued military and financial support. Zelensky has expressed openness to such an arrangement, saying that Ukraine is willing to grant U.S. companies access to minerals in exchange for sustained support from Washington. The proposed minerals agreement could mark a significant shift in U.S.-Ukraine relations, tying economic cooperation to security assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-vance-meeting-postponed-as-us-reviews-ukraines-partnership-draft/	2025-02-14T02:21:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Sudan to allow Russia to build its first naval base in Africa	Sudan will allow Russia to build its first naval base in Africa, the country&apos;s foreign minister, Ali Youssef, said during a visit to Moscow on Feb. 12. &quot;Sudan and Russia have reached an understanding on the agreement regarding the Russian naval base,&quot; Youssef said during a press briefing with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. &quot;The matter is very simple. We have agreed on everything,&quot; he added. The naval base &#x2014; which has been under discussion since 2017 &#x2014; would give Moscow access to the Red Sea, one of the world&#x2019;s most strategically important waterways through which 12% of global trade passes through due to the presence of the Suez Canal at its northern end. China and the U.S. already have access to the sea as they both hold naval bases in Djibouti to the south of Sudan. The announcement comes after the future of Russia&apos;s naval presence in the Mediterranean was thrown into question after the overthrow of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. Syria&apos;s new government will decide the fate of Russian military bases based on national interests, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told The Washington Post on Feb. 6. Russia&apos;s ability to retain its naval base in Tartus and airbase in Khmeimim will depend on what Moscow offers in return, Abu Qasra indicated. &quot;If we benefit Syria from it, yes,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/sudan-to-allow-russia-to-build-its-first-naval-base-in-africa/	2025-02-14T02:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190592959.jpg
3 lessons from Minsk II for the US in a future Russia-Ukraine peace deal	The following op-ed is based on a broader report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), published on Feb. 11, 2025. Some peace deals lead to peace; others lead to more war. The Minsk II deal, aimed at ending Russia&#x2019;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, instead laid the groundwork for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The United States must learn from the Minsk deal or risk a direct Russia-NATO conflict that puts American lives at risk. Minsk II was a weak deal. It demanded nothing of the invader &#x2014; Russia. It reinforced the Kremlin&#x2019;s aggressive worldview that had driven the conflict to begin with, masking Russia&#x2019;s military weakness. It gave the Kremlin time and space to prepare for a larger invasion. The West could have helped Ukraine reach a stronger deal in 2015. Minsk II gave Russian President Vladimir Putin hope that he could win in Ukraine without war. Russia sought and failed to control Ukraine in 2014 through military means. Minsk II gave Putin a way to demand that Ukraine &#x2014; a sovereign state &#x2014; cede control over its internal policies. When that failed, Putin turned to the full-scale invasion in 2022. Minsk II helped Putin mask his demands for Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender behind false calls for peace. The West has repeatedly failed to confront and counter the real Russian demands since 2014. Minsk II reinforced Western delusions that Putin might settle if he received some land or if the West scaled back support for Ukraine or tried harder to negotiate with him. The deal also provided an excuse for those who understood the Kremlin&#x2019;s goals but still sought to restore ties with Russia. Vladislav Surkov, Putin&#x2019;s close adviser in 2014, said in 2024 that Minsk II &#x201C;legitimized the first partition of Ukraine.&#x201D; Surkov&#x2019;s words confirm Russia&#x2019;s goal to destroy Ukraine as a state and use the Minsk deal to achieve that. He added that &#x201C;peace is nothing more than the continuation of war by other means.&#x201D; Another weak deal today would validate Putin&#x2019;s 2022 invasion and give him hope of gaining more over time. Hope for Putin means more war. More war means a larger conflict: A Russia absolved of any cost for its invasion will want more and rebuild its ability to do so. A larger war would raise costs for the U.S., put American lives at risk, and escalate the conflict to catastrophic levels. The Trump administration has a historic opportunity to break Russia&#x2019;s cycle of overt war and war by &#x201C;peace&#x201D; in Ukraine. To do so, the U.S. must learn the lessons from the Minsk deal. Russia will aim to shift the blame for and cost of its war of choice in Ukraine, as it did with the Minsk II deal. The Kremlin will blame the U.S., NATO, Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Western defense industrial complex, Anglo-Saxons with their &#x201C;aggressive intentions,&#x201D; as the Russian Foreign Ministry puts it, and others. Russia will attempt to offload the cost of the destruction it caused in Ukraine onto someone else&#x2019;s balance sheet &#x2014; be it Ukraine, the U.S., or other Ukrainian partners. The starting U.S. position should be that Russia owns the problem it created. Anything less than a demand for Russia to foot the trillion-dollar bill for the damage it caused and to restore the borders of Ukraine that Russia formally recognized in 1991 and 1994 should be framed as a major concession to Putin. Negotiations that start with preemptive concessions on these demands, without insisting on parallel Russian concessions, would repeat the central mistake of the Minsk deal. The U.S. must make Russia own the problem it created, both for the sake of a just peace and out of pure pragmatism. There is no reason someone else should cover the bill for Russia&#x2019;s war. Russia&#x2019;s war of choice killed and wounded an estimated million people. Russia caused an estimated half a trillion to a trillion dollars in damage to Ukraine and billions to the U.S. and other partner nations. Russia robbed three &#x2014; and in some cases, 11 &#x2014; years from the lives of Ukrainians. Russia cost countless hours and energy from people in the U.S. and globally working to end Russia&#x2019;s war. Russia chose to start this war for no legitimate reason, and it can choose to end it at any point. Ukraine did not pose a threat to Russia. Putin thought Ukraine was so militarily weak that he could conquer it in a matter of days in 2022. Russia was not seriously concerned with a military threat from NATO, as evidenced by Russia&#x2019;s military posture for years before 2022 and even during its war in Ukraine. Putin had effectively blocked Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO accession by 2022. Putin did not invade to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine &#x2014; Russian forces are killing Russian speakers at scale in Ukraine. There were no legitimate &#x201C;casus belli&#x201D; &#x2014; only Putin&#x2019;s desire to control Ukraine. Russia can stop its war at any point. Russian troops can simply withdraw from Ukraine. Russia will still exist as a state without Ukraine. Another deal that absolves Russia will lead to a larger war with higher costs for the U.S. A deal that lets Russia keep its illegal gains in Ukraine at no cost will reinforce the mindset that drove Russia to invade, bringing close to zero the chances of a Russia compatible with U.S. interests, Ukraine&#x2019;s existence, and a peaceful Europe. Minsk 3.0 would create a Russia that will want even more and will be able to do more. The Russia of 2025 is not the Russia of 2022. Russia in 2022 was expansionist enough to attack its neighbor without provocation and kill thousands &#x2014; only to fail to achieve its declared war aims three years later. U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak to the media at a press conference on the second day of the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on July 12, 2018. (Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Putin has transformed Russian society to support military conquest over three years of war. He has empowered Russian ultranationalists who believe in expansion by force. Putin has promoted these ultranationalists to prominent positions within Russia. Russian ultranationalists are inherently anti-American. They see Russia as being at war with the U.S.-led collective West for the new world order. They are committed to sustaining the war indefinitely and advocate for the permanent mobilization of the Russian people and the means to fight the West. The U.S. would not only face a stronger Putin or Putinist regime (or worse) but a stronger, battle-forged Russian military that is experienced in fighting a NATO-supplied adversary, has a better starting position on the battlefield compared to February 2022, and has stronger ties with China, Iran, and North Korea. Putin is hardly eager to return over half a million violent Russian men deployed to Ukraine back to Russia. He will likely seek to redirect their energy elsewhere if the lines in Ukraine are frozen with no constraints on Russian forces or the Kremlin&#x2019;s choices. If an emboldened and more capable Russia invades Ukraine to complete the conquest, it will cost more Ukrainian lives and very likely bring the Russian military closer to NATO borders, increasing the risk of a direct NATO-Russia conflict. The U.S. risks a larger war with higher costs and higher escalation risks on conditions that favor Russia. The only way to break the vicious cycle of Russian wars is not to absolve Russia of responsibility and force Russia to own the problem it created. The Kremlin will falsely insist that Ukraine is not sovereign. Russia will try to make a deal directly with the U.S. (if Putin considers a deal at all). The Kremlin will falsely insist that Zelensky is not legitimate and demand that Ukraine hold elections that violate its constitution. Putin will embed provisions to destroy Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty into any deal. Putin has already laid out preconditions and poison pills for even sitting down at the table. He is demanding limits on Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom to choose its partners and Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself (e.g., demanding that Ukraine limit the size of its military). Russia&#x2019;s negotiators will engineer ways to control the physical enforcement mechanism in any deal. The Kremlin needs to preserve options to escalate the war at will. Putin will try to do what he tried (and failed) to do via Minsk II &#x2014; legitimize the Kremlin&#x2019;s invasion without any security guarantees to Ukraine. Putin&#x2019;s individual demands &#x2014; territory, neutrality, elections, and others &#x2014; are irrelevant. Putin&#x2019;s demands are proxies for Russia&#x2019;s actual goals: controlling Ukraine and having the U.S. and NATO cede their principles and interests to accommodate a world order that favors Russia. The U.S. should deprive Putin of the hope that he can achieve either. This war can only end when Russia knows it cannot win militarily or through another &#x201C;peace&#x201D; deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 25, 2025. (Yan Dobronosov / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)The U.S. should focus on conditions compatible with Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and U.S. interests &#x2014; rather than discussing lines on the map. The U.S. should reject direct U.S.-Russia talks or Putin&#x2019;s demands regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic affairs, including elections, or any other demand that limits Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. Conceding to Putin&#x2019;s demands before talks would be a self-imposed failure. Any deal that gives Putin hope to control Ukraine will fail, as Minsk did. A deal that does not give Putin hope to control Ukraine is not a deal that Putin will accept &#x2014; unless this deal is imposed on him through a battlefield defeat, a severe degradation of Russian military capability, or a credible deterrent. A deterrent that has a chance to deter Russia requires a capable military force immune to Western political cycles and Russian influence. That is a tall order. Anything short of that, however, will not be viewed as a deterrent by Russia, will be co-opted by Russia, and will lead to another war. A UN-brokered enforcement mechanism is a non-starter, for example, because of Russia&#x2019;s veto power in the UN Security Council. A credible deterrent is impossible without a strong defense industrial base (DIB) in the West and Ukraine. The West&#x2019;s weak DIB gives Putin hope. The Kremlin has exploited the fact that Europe&#x2019;s DIB could not surge in support of Ukraine and that the U.S. could have but lacked the will to fill the void. A state&#x2019;s DIB is a proxy for its will. Depriving Putin of hope to subjugate Ukraine in his lifetime requires a strong Western and Ukrainian DIB able to alter the assumptions of Russian military planning. Putin will try to convince U.S. leaders that making him accept less than his goals in Ukraine is a non-starter. He will try to convince the U.S. that this war is unwinnable or that U.S. support will not matter, will only prolong the war, or is too risky. Russia will draw the next set of red lines. Putin can be made to accept a loss without escalating. He settled for less than his aims in Ukraine in 2014 and in 2022. Ukraine defeated Russia at the Battle of Kyiv and expelled Russian forces from critical terrain in Ukraine in 2022. Russian authorities claimed Russia would be in Kherson &#x201C;forever,&#x201D; but they withdrew in 2022. Putin was forced to accept Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in 2024 &#x2014; the first invasion of Russia since World War II. Putin reportedly ordered the Russian forces to liberate Kursk by October 2024 &#x2014; a mission failure as of February 2025. Russia&#x2019;s decade of gains in Syria is at risk. Russian military basing and political influence in Syria were key to Russia&#x2019;s power in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Africa, a pillar of its cooperation with Iran, and a way to contest the U.S. and pressure NATO&#x2019;s southern flank. A decade of Putin&#x2019;s work is at the mercy of HTS &#x2014; militants whom Russia used to call terrorists but can no longer because HTS holds Moscow at its mercy. Each time Putin accepted a setback, the new reality was not &#x201C;negotiated&#x201D; with Putin&#x2014;it was imposed on him by force. The U.S. will eventually recognize that the only way to have Russia accept a deal is to impose one on Russia. The U.S. should not distract itself by providing Putin an &#x201C;offramp.&#x201D; Putin has an offramp &#x2014; the Kremlin&#x2019;s control of Russia&#x2019;s information space. The Kremlin reframed or downplayed Putin&apos;s humiliating setbacks &#x2014; from Russia&#x2019;s retreat from Kherson to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin&#x2019;s mutiny to the degradation and expulsion of the Black Sea fleet from Crimea, and countless others. This information control allowed Putin to normalize a new and worse reality in Russia each time, including softening the blow for an estimated 800,000 Russian casualties in pursuit of arguably mediocre battlefield results in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin lays flowers at the Piskarevskoye Memorial Cemetery in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Jan. 27, 2025. (Artem Priakhin / SOPA Images / Getty Images)Putin and Russia have failed before. There is no compelling reason why Putin should not be made to fail again. And if the information offramp eventually fails him, that is not the U.S.&#x2019; problem. Putin is not invulnerable. This war is not lost, despite Russia&#x2019;s increased but still modest gains in eastern Ukraine. While Russia has well-documented advantages, Putin is also accumulating risks and costs. His military faces material and manpower shortages, ongoing issues with force generation, and economic strains &#x2014; including inflation, labor shortages, the erosion of Russia&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, and increasingly costly trade-offs between funneling limited manpower to the frontlines or shoring up the economy. Russia also depends on partners to sustain its war effort, and shifting U.S. policies toward China and Iran are putting those enabling relationships at risk. None of this will matter, however, if a Trump administration gifts Russia the time and space to regroup &#x2014; just as the Biden administration&#x2019;s incremental approach has allowed Putin to in the past. As Minsk II helped obscure Russian failures in 2015, a premature deal now risks letting Putin off the hook before he faces hard choices and mounting pressures &#x2014; before Ukraine and the U.S. attain a true position of strength. The Kremlin will face mounting costs if the U.S. and its partners apply maximum pressure &#x2014; something they have yet to do since Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Washington still has many underutilized tools to ratchet up pressure on Russia, from striking harder at its energy sector to targeting the Kremlin across multiple theaters and domains. But the most effective driver of Russia&#x2019;s economic losses remains its sustained battlefield defeats. Maximum pressure on Russia is impossible without U.S. military support for Ukraine. The U.S. and its partners must ensure the Kremlin faces compounding pressure &#x2014; on the battlefield and beyond &#x2014; without easy ways to offset it.

US judge orders temporary lift Trump administration's freeze on foreign aid	A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Feb. 13 to temporarily lift its funding freeze on U.S. foreign aid programs, including development work worldwide, the Associated Press reported. The ruling marks a significant setback for the administration&apos;s effort to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have accused of operating outside the administration&apos;s agenda. Musk, who heads the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has called USAID a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and advocated for its dissolution. Judge Amir Ali issued the order in response to a lawsuit filed by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations that receive U.S. funding for international projects. The Trump administration ordered a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign assistance upon taking office, placing USAID under State Department control last week. Crews were seen removing its signage from the agency&apos;s Washington headquarters on Feb. 7. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that U.S. foreign aid should align with national interests rather than function as charity, emphasizing that assistance programs would not be eliminated. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society programs.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-judge-orders-temporary-lift-trump-administrations-freeze-on-foreign-aid/	2025-02-14T00:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185934538.jpg
US aid to Ukraine could become 'carrot or stick' in talks with Russia, Hegseth says	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not rule out that future U.S. aid to Ukraine could become a bargaining tool in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, CNN reported on Feb. 13. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Hegseth said that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration continues to deliver the allocated security assistance to Ukraine but hinted that future funding could be conditional. &quot;I think it would be fair to say that things like future funding, either less or more, could be on the table in negotiations as well,&quot; Hegseth said. He emphasized that Trump will decide what measures to use in potential talks with Russia. &quot;Whatever the president determines is the most robust carrot or stick on either side to induce a durable peace, understanding, obviously, the motivations that Vladimir Putin has had on Ukraine for quite some time,&quot; Hegseth added. Trump has also signaled that U.S. aid to Ukraine could be tied to economic incentives, including access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Feb. 13 that NATO is assuming a greater role in supporting Ukraine, even as the future of U.S. military aid remains uncertain. Previously, Hegseth said the U.S. does not consider Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. Trump echoed this stance, saying that he does not believe Ukraine joining the alliance is practical. Ukraine officially applied for NATO membership in September 2022, following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While alliance members reaffirmed in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to NATO is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. Russia has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for its invasion, a claim widely dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-aid-to-ukraine-could-become-carrot-or-stick-in-talks-with-russia-hegseth-says/	2025-02-14T00:10:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193880159.jpg
Chornobyl Nuclear Plant shelter damaged in Russian drone strike	A Russian attack drone struck the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Feb. 14. The strike damaged the shelter, but the fire was extinguished, and radiation levels remained stable, according to the president. Monitoring efforts continue to assess any potential risks. &quot;This is a terrorist threat to the entire world,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that the damage to the shelter is significant. &quot;The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today&apos;s Russia.&quot; The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the explosion. The organization reported that a drone struck the roof of the shelter. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged moment of a Russian drone strike on the protective shelter of the destroyed 4th power unit at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Feb. 14, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram).Chornobyl, the site of the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster, remains a highly sensitive location. The explosion of the plant&apos;s reactor on Apr. 26, 1986, contaminated a vast area spanning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Zelensky said the attack underscores Russia&apos;s continued disregard for global security. &quot;Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric. This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations &#x2014; he is preparing to continue deceiving the world,&quot; he said. The Chornobyl plant, located about 130 kilometers north of Kyiv, was briefly occupied by Russian forces in the early days of the full-scale invasion. They held the station&apos;s staff hostage, creating significant risks to nuclear safety. On Mar. 31, 2022, Russian troops withdrew from the station. During the occupation, increased radiation levels were recorded due to the movement of heavy machinery that stirred up contaminated dust. Russia attacked the station&apos;s protective shelter on the day of the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky is leading Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic strategy for ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chornobyl-nuclear-plant-shelter-damaged-in-russian-drone-strike/	2025-02-13T23:46:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Karina-Piliuhina-5.jpg
Plane malfunction forces State Secretary Rubio to return to Washington while en route to Munich Security Conference	A U.S. Air Force plane carrying U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch was forced to return to Washington due to a technical malfunction, the Associated Press reported on Feb. 14. &#xA0; Rubio and Risch were en route to Germany for the Munich Security Conference. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio are scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 14. The aircraft, a C-32 converted Boeing 757, experienced a problem with the cockpit windshield about 90 minutes after takeoff from Joint Base Andrews, prompting an emergency return to the base. &#xA0; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce confirmed the incident, saying Rubio &quot;intends to continue his travel to Germany and the Middle East on a separate aircraft.&quot; &#xA0; Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic approach to ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/plane-carrying-secretary-rubio-to-munich-returns-to-washington-due-to-malfunction/	2025-02-13T22:42:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 855,480 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 855,480 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 14. This number includes 1,200 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,057 tanks, 20,910 armored fighting vehicles, 37,252 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,115 artillery systems, 1,282 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,066 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 25,224 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-855-480-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-13T22:18:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
German company to manufacture 6,000 AI-powered drones for Ukraine	Ukraine is set to receive 6,000 AI-powered HX-2 attack drones from the Munich-based defense technology firm Helsing. The HX-2, an electrically propelled precision munition with a range of up to 100 km, is equipped with onboard artificial intelligence, ensuring resilience against electronic warfare. Integrated into Helsing&#x2019;s Altra reconnaissance-strike system, the drones can operate in coordinated swarms under the control of a single operator, according to the company&#x2019;s statement. This follows a prior order of 4,000 HF-1 drones that Helsing committed to in Nov. 2024. Helsing signed a memorandum with Ukraine on cooperation in the field of defense technology in February 2024. The company has been active in Ukraine since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-company-to-manufacture-6-000-ai-powered-drones-for-ukraine/	2025-02-13T21:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2158978909.jpg
European Business Association calls on Ukraine to declassify mineral deposit data	The European Business Association (EBA) urged the Ukrainian government to declassify its information on mineral deposit data, in a statement on Feb. 13. The association argued that current restrictions hinder international agreements and discourage investment. Currently, information on resources such as gold, lithium, titanium, and platinum is classified as secret or &quot;for official use,&quot; limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to engage with global partners. &#x201C;Maintaining the &#x201C;secret&#x201D; classification of balance sheet reserves and resources may hinder their development and reduce investor interest,&#x201D; the statement said. The EBA also noted that the issue is especially relevant given Ukraine&#x2019;s economic recovery plans under the Ukraine Facility program, and its strategic partnership with the EU in raw materials. This comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent push for a rare earth deal with Ukraine, in exchange for providing further U.S. military aid. &quot;I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 11. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain unclear. Ukraine is home to 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals, like titanium, used in the aerospace and defense industries, and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. Aside from this, the country also possesses rare earth elements &#x2014; under which titanium and lithium do not fall &#x2014; such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-business-association-calls-on-ukraine-to-declassify-mineral-deposit-data/	2025-02-13T19:42:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1679993124.jpg
Ukraine’s possible territorial losses may be 'formalized without recognition by US,' Kellogg tells Fox News	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 13 that &quot;formalizing Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial losses&quot; in a potential peace deal &quot;will not equate to recognizing them.&quot; &quot;I think there will be a certain agreement on the potential loss of territory. But, look, you don&apos;t have to admit it,&quot; Kellogg said. He also supported U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth&#x2019;s view that restoring Ukraine&#x2019;s 2014 borders would be an &quot;unrealistic objective&quot; and that the Trump administration&#x2019;s priority is on ending the war as soon as possible. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Kellogg referenced the 1940 Welles Declaration, which rejected Soviet ownership of the Baltic states despite their occupation, implying that a similar approach could apply to Ukraine. &quot;When the Soviets segregated the Baltic countries, we never said they owned the countries. We said there was just a sort of domination,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance are expected to meet during the top European security conference, which will take place between Feb. 14 and 16. The U.S. delegation will also include Kellog and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Though the details of the expected Vance-Zelensky meeting have not been disclosed, Kellogg previously said that U.S. officials would talk in Munich about Trump&apos;s &quot;goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine.&quot; Kellogg is scheduled to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, while Trump mentioned plans to meet with Zelensky soon, though he did not specify the location or timing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-possible-territorial-losses-may-be-formalized-without-recognition-by-us-kellogg-tells-fox-news/	2025-02-13T18:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
Putin is afraid of you' — Zelensky reportedly told Trump during phone call, Axios reports	During a phone call between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, Zelensky reportedly told Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin is pretending &quot;he wants a deal only because he is afraid of you,&quot; Axios reported on Feb. 13, citing a Ukrainian official and three other sources familiar with the call. On Feb. 12, Trump held separate calls with Zelensky and Putin, later claiming both leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; In their call, Trump and Putin agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;Zelensky&apos;s message to Trump was &apos;you have leverage over Putin,&apos;&quot; one source familiar with the call told Axios. Other sources describe the, which went on for over an hour, as positive. After Zelensky delivered his warning to Trump that &quot;Putin told you he wants a deal only because he is afraid of you, because you are strong,&quot; Trump acknowledge that may be the case, but believed Putin was serious about the prospects for peace, according to two sources. &quot;We will know soon,&quot; Trump concluded. Trump reportedly ended the call by giving Zelensky his personal cell phone number and told Zelensky he can reach him directly, one source said. Following the previously unannounced call to Putin, Zelensky took issue Trump first holding a conversation with Putin before calling Zelensky, expressing that the situation &quot;was not very pleasant.&quot; Previously, Trump announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the talks remains unclear. A Ukrainian official on Feb. 13 denied Ukraine will participate in a joint meeting between U.S. and Russian representatives in Munich after U.S. President Donald Trump said that talks will be held on Feb. 14. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s position remains unchanged. Ukraine must first speak with America. Europe must be part of any serious conversation for a genuine and lasting peace. Only a coordinated, unified position should be on the table for talks with the Russians. We don&#x2019;t meet with Russians at an empty table,&quot; Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor to the Presidential Office said in a statement. As prospects for the start of peace negotiation are set to begin, Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance are expected to meet during the top European security conference, taking place between Feb. 14 and 16. The U.S. delegation will also include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-afraid-of-you-zelensky-reportedly-told-trump-during-phone-call-axios-reports/	2025-02-13T16:43:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/ab450760d095ba9bedb4bf6141024e52_1701106040_extra_large.jpg
Starmer reiterates UK's support for Ukraine's NATO membership following US dismissal	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path&quot; to NATO membership during a news conference on Feb. 13, just days after the United States declared that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. &quot;My position is the NATO position,&quot; Starmer told reporters. &quot;This was discussed at the summit that we had last year in Washington, where it was agreed amongst all NATO members that there should be an irreversible path of Ukraine to NATO membership.&quot; Starmer&apos;s comments come amid U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth comments on Feb. 12 that it is unrealistic to expect that Ukraine can restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations, and that NATO membership was effectively off the table. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. also wants to see Ukraine as &quot;sovereign and prosperous,&quot; but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&quot; When asked by reporters if the U.K. would change course on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in light of the U.S. position, Starmer was definitive in his response. &quot;No, obviously nobody was expecting (Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership) to be immediate. It was a pathway over time. But what matters most, I think, is that we stand by Ukraine.&quot; In July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.&quot; NATO allies also emphasized that decisions made during the summit and the NATO-Ukraine Council, as well as the Allies&#x2019; ongoing work, constitute a bridge to Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in NATO. Earlier in the day, Reform UK Party leader Nigel Farage, a staunch Trump ally, echoed sentiments about Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, stating that it was &quot;probably essential&quot; that Ukraine join the military alliance. Various European officials previously expressed disappointment at Hegseth&apos;s comments. Estonian politician Marko Mihkelson expressed his concern, saying, &quot;Today might go down in history as a dark day for Europe,&quot; urging European leaders to recognize the importance of taking action now. Meanwhile, Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, declaring, &quot;Ukraine&apos;s independence and territorial integrity are unconditional.&quot; She stressed the need for Europe to play a central role in strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees in any negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-reiterates-uks-support-for-ukraine-nato-member-following/	2025-02-13T15:09:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Following an attack on opposition, Zelensky effectively begins election season	President Volodymyr Zelensky had imposed sanctions against the official leader of the opposition, ex-President Petro Poroshenko. The following decree was published on Feb. 13. Despite the official reasoning given by the country&apos;s Security Service being high treason committed a decade ago, the unilateral sanctions imposed on the former president have been seen as a political rather than a security decision. Following a growing political activity inside the country, and the official pressure from the U.S. on Kyiv to hold elections by the end of the year, experts say that the informal election season has begun in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine could hold elections being &quot;in a strong position&quot; after the &quot;hot phase&quot; of the war is over. He did not rule out that this could happen in 2025. &quot;(This) will be very difficult to do because society is against it. Because we want elections that we want to trust,&quot; the president said. Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties who spoke to the Kyiv Independent played the blame game, saying it&apos;s the other side that is preparing for a vote. Meanwhile, both sides are. &quot;There is an electoral fever. The expectation of the end of the war has prompted the expectation of elections,&quot; said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst. While on the campaign trail, Zelenksy promised to be a one-term president. That was before the all-out war catapulted Zelensky into worldwide stardom. Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy is now questioned, however, by both Washington and Moscow alike. Under martial law, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned in Ukraine. If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election would have been held in the spring of 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20. Keith Kellogg, U.S. special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Feb. 1 that presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine &quot;need to be done&quot; possibly by the end of 2025. &quot;You&apos;re gonna reach a point where they&apos;re gonna have to have elections, and that&apos;s a sign of a healthy democracy,&quot; he said a few days later. The sentiment echoes far-right commentators in the U.S. and the Kremlin who have been saying that no peace deal is possible with Zelensky since his term &quot;expired.&quot; When asked during recent interviews whether he is planning to run for another term, Zelensky did not rule out the possibility. &quot;It depends on how this war ends. Basically, it depends on people first and foremost, and of course on my family,&quot; he told American podcaster Lex Friedman. Yet, if he decides to run, Zelensky might face a formidable opponent &#x2014; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief, who was dismissed by the president following a public fallout. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and now Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, attends a ceremony of laying flowers at the Memory Wall of Fallen Ukrainian Defenders in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 5, 2025. (Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images)According to a fall survey by the Social Monitoring Center, 27% of Ukrainians would vote for Zaluzhnyi, while only 16% would choose Zelensky. &quot;&apos;Zaluzhnyi did not let the guys die,&apos; is the thesis that Ukrainians use when talking about Zaluzhnyi,&quot; Oleksii Antypovych, Ukrainian sociologist and the head of the Rating Group, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This certainly creates an image of a hearty, kind defender, a father. And all this is supported, and people would be ready to vote for him,&quot; Antypovych added. However, Zaluzhnyi, now an ambassador to the U.K., never officially stated his intention to run for office, despite hinting his interest. If Zaluzhnyi doesn&apos;t throw his hat into the race, another figure is likely to take his spot. Other personalities usually listed among those who can potentially run for president include spy chief Kyrylo Budanov and showman-turned-politician Serhii Prytula. While new faces are yet to emerge, there are signs that veteran politicians appear to have started groundwork in case elections are scheduled. Former President Poroshenko, who now heads the opposition European Solidarity party, said in April 2024 that he was planning to participate in the next presidential election. Despite Poroshenko&apos;s massive anti-rating and accumulated distrust among the majority of the population, the former president commands a small but dedicated support group. He also attempts to act presidential, sometimes working in parallel with the actual president. When the Ukrainian delegation traveled to the U.S. in early December, Poroshenko also visited Washington at the time and shortly interacted with U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. He sat for an interview with the Voice of America and proposed a &quot;Poroshenko plan,&quot; mimicking Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; presented in October 2024. In early February, Poroshenko headed to the U.S. again, seeking to establish contacts with Trump&apos;s administration. He wasn&apos;t officially authorized to do so. Publicly, Poroshenko denies that his party, which holds 27 seats out of 450 in Ukraine&apos;s parliament, is preparing for elections. &quot;Elections in Ukraine would undermine unity, &quot;Poroshenko said. &quot;Who will win these elections? Poroshenko? Zelensky? I doubt it. One person will win them &#x2014; Putin.&quot; &quot;I do not yet see the prerequisites for security conditions for holding (the elections),&quot; Iryna Herashchenko, a lawmaker from the European Solidarity faction, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There are certain discussions at the committee level, but there hasn&apos;t been a serious conversation in the parliament.&quot; Meanwhile, Poroshenko has been an ongoing target for law enforcement and the president&apos;s office. Around 130 criminal cases were opened against Poroshenko, he said in late January, with most of them launched after appeals by people who are convicted or have fled to Russia. Prior to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Poroshenko was charged with high treason. Telegram channels linked to the president&apos;s office have regularly hinted that Poroshenko would be prosecuted or sanctioned.

(Andrei Pungovschi / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Zelensky approved a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) decision on Feb. 13 to impose indefinite sanctions on several high-profile politicians, oligarchs, and businessmen. Sanctions were imposed against oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, billionaire Konstantin Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadiy Boholyubov, Viktor Medvedchuk, a former pro-Russian lawmaker accused of state treason, Poroshenko. The sanctions freeze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and block them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states the measures are indefinite. Poroshenko said that sanctions against him are &quot;politically motivated.&quot; &quot;Why are they doing this? Hatred, fear and revenge. And because their election campaign has begun. Not for us. For the authorities,&quot; he said. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, one of Poroshenko&apos;s key allies, voiced support for the former president. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 25, 2024. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;When the fight against an external enemy is combined with a political struggle within the country, democracy and the country as a whole loses,&quot; Klitschko said. Klitschko, who once led a nationwide political project and was seen as a potential presidential candidate, has had a long-standing conflict with Zelensky. He claims ongoing pressure from government authorities. Professor Oleksiy Haran, research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, connects the sanctions imposed on Poroshenko with the relaunched domestic political fights. &quot;I think now it&apos;s because these conversations about elections have started. Although Poroshenko is lagging behind Zelensky in the ratings,&quot; Haran said. &quot;It seems to me that this campaign, well, it will lead to a potential decline in Zelensky&apos;s popularity as well,&quot; he added. &quot;I honestly think that this is a bad step for the country as a whole. And that it will not add to Zelensky&apos;s authority.&quot; Both Haran and Fesenko have been questioning the reasoning behind such a move. &quot;Poroshenko is not a competitor for Zelensky. He will be one of the prominent participants in the upcoming elections, but Poroshenko has no chance of winning over Zelensky,&quot; Fesenko said. Another former heavyweight, ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, is leading the Batkivshchyna party and attempting to stay afloat. Tymoshenko told the Economist, published in late September, that &quot;the political process has definitely started.&quot; Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko speaks during an exclusive interview on the latest developments of Russian attacks on Ukraine in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 7, 2022. (Emin Sansar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Lawmaker Serhii Taruta, head of Industrial Union of Donbas and major backer of Batkivshchyna party, said that Zelensky&apos;s party had allegedly started getting ready for elections, scheduling the voting for May 2025. &quot;Then they (Servant of the People) considered the possibility that it would be in the fall. I suppose that all political forces, including Batkivshchyna, were not preparing but considering this possibility.&quot; Tymoshenko was spotted in the U.S. during one of the events marking Trump&apos;s inauguration. It&apos;s unclear whether she was invited there and whether she met with American officials. Zelensky, meanwhile, was represented by David Arakhamia, the leader of Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People parliament faction, who headed the Ukrainian delegation at Ukraine-Russia talks at the beginning of the all-out war. Arakhamia remains a vital link between Zelensky and his own party and an important player in any future political project connected with the president. Election season in Ukraine is also a chance for Russia to disrupt the country&apos;s domestic political scene, something that was regularly done in the past. In December, a TikTok video by Yuriy Boyko, a lawmaker and former head of the now-banned pro-Russian Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life party, sparked public outrage and speculation that Moscow is preparing for Ukrainian elections. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Boyko tried to brush off his pro-Russiannes. He condemned Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine but continued spreading long-standing propaganda narratives. &quot;(The existence of pro-Russian parties) in Ukraine today is simply impossible. This is a suicidal party that no one will vote for,&quot; Antypovysh said. Lawmaker Yuriy Boyko talks to the press after the morning extraordinary session of Ukraine&apos;s parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)In the meantime, he does not rule out that such parties can reinvent themselves and advocate for the protection of peace, Soviet and Russian culture, and the Russian language &#x2014; a policy backed by Boyko and a number of other fringe Ukrainian politicians, such as Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov. Unlike with Poroshenko, the government isn&apos;t actively going after Boyko. Despite being embroiled in a number of high-profile corruption probes, Boyko was never charged. Feseneko suggests that once martial law is lifted, Ukraine may amend its legislation and ban pro-Russian politicians from running for elections, although this move potentially could be appealed in court. Yet, elections remain a longshot, with Ukraine expected to face multiple challenges when it comes to making sure that such a vote is possible. Russian constant attacks make it impossible to hold elections as hostilities are ongoing. Moscow&apos;s forces regularly launch missiles and drones at Ukraine, targeting population centers both in front-line settlements and those thousands of kilometers away. Once martial law is lifted, Ukraine&apos;s Central Election Commission should announce the start of the election campaign. According to Ukraine&apos;s law, starting from that moment, 90 days should pass before presidential elections are to be held, 54 to 60 days before the parliamentary elections, and 50 days before local elections. However, preparations for the post-war elections are expected to take even longer. Experts and lawmakers do not rule out the possibility that Ukrainian legislation may also be amended.

(Wolfgang Schwan / Anadolu via Getty Images)Over 7 million Ukrainians left the country as a result of Russia&apos;s war and are staying abroad. &#xA0;Another 4.5 million are internally displaced. That&apos;s around a third of Ukraine&apos;s entire population. With around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territories occupied by Russia, &quot;millions more&quot; remain in the Russian-occupied territories, according to Zelensky. &quot;And one of the most unfair things &#x2014; how to vote without a million of soldiers,&quot; Oleksandr Salizhenko, editor-in-chief of the political watchdog Chesno. Another problem is the locations where a vote will be held. Electoral infrastructure, such as schools, is destroyed in multiple settlements in Ukraine-controlled territories due to Russian attacks. &quot;Now, it&apos;s not that these institutions don&apos;t exist; there are no cities, law enforcement agencies, judges, and the state is not actually represented there. This is one of the reasons for the lack of conditions for actually holding elections,&quot; Salizhenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/following-an-attack-against-on-opposition-zelensky-effectively-begins-election-season/	2025-02-13T13:45:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
US to hold meeting with Russian, Ukrainian officials on Feb. 14 in Munich	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 13 that U.S. representatives will attend a meeting with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. &quot;They&apos;re having a meeting in Munich tomorrow. Russia is going to be there with our people. Ukraine is also invited,&quot; Trump told reporters during a news conference in Oval Office. &quot;Not sure who exactly is going to be there from any country but high level people from Russia, from Ukraine, and from the United States,&quot; he added. No further details were provided on the expected meeting. Trump&apos;s comments to reporters comes a day after he held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Shortly after Trump&#x2019;s call with Putin, he and President Volodymyr Zelensky had held a phone call. Trump&apos;s comments come amid reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance are expected to meet during the top European security conference, taking place between Feb. 14 and 16. The U.S. delegation will also include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg. Though the details of the expected Vance-Zelensky meeting have not been disclosed, Kellogg previously said that U.S. officials would talk in Munich about Trump&apos;s &quot;goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine.&quot; Russia was not previously expected to attend talks at the security conference. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media on Feb. 13 that Russia has started forming a group for talks with the United States, including on the war with Ukraine. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during telephone talks to instruct aides to prepare for a face-to-face meeting immediately.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-hold-meeting-with-russian-ukrainian-officials-on-feb-14-in-munich/	2025-02-13T13:14:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
‘A push for Ukraine’s capitulation’ – Baltic, Eastern Europe react to Trump’s rush to negotiate peace with Putin	European nations, particularly Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors and the Baltic states, were stunned when the U.S. President Donald Trump suddenly announced the start of peace negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. &quot;We have agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Volodymyr Zelensky, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,&#x201D; Trump said on Feb. 12 after a phone call with Putin. Trump&#x2019;s sudden announcement comes as his team continues to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s potential leverage at the negotiating table &#x2013; such as the NATO membership aspiration and the demand to return to 1991 borders &#x2013; before the talks have even begun. It also comes as Russia retains the initiative in multiple sectors of the front line, forcing the Ukrainian troops to withdraw from one settlement after another amid a critical manpower shortage. With the new White House administration pushing to quickly end the war, now nearly in its fourth year, Kyiv has demanded that it takes part in any talks concerning Ukraine. For Central-Eastern European nations and the Baltic states that have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s sudden push for peace talks is highly alarming. Calling for Ukraine and Europe to be involved in the process, they stressed that the best way to ensure European security is by pumping more military aid into Ukraine and strengthening its positions. &#xA0; (L-R) Estonian President Alar Karis, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics pose after addressing a press conference at the presidential palace in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Feb. 9, 2025, after the Baltic states joined the EU power grid. (Petras Malukas / AFP / Getty Images)World leaders will meet at the annual Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, where the war in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda. The Kyiv Independent spoke to officials and experts from central eastern Europe and the Baltics to present their views on Trump&#x2019;s negotiation drive to end the war at any costs. The comments have been edited for clarity. Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister (2020-2024) The main question that I think that needs to be answered now is: is there leadership enough in Europe to take over what the U.S. left yesterday? The questions that need to be answered: Is Europe able to offer real security guarantees to Ukraine? Is Europe able to resist agreeing to an agreement between Putin and Trump that would leave Ukrainian territories under (Russian) occupation. And it will probably be the most important hour for Europe, because if Europe is unable, then it&apos;s a battle lost. Then it&apos;s Putin&apos;s victory. It&apos;s a very dark hour for Europe. What we heard yesterday from President Trump is that they are determined to have peace talks, even the talks that might probably not even involve Ukraine, which is completely beyond the realm of understanding. But this might just happen. And then it boils down to what Ukraine is doing, to what Europe is doing, and to what separate countries are doing. So I hope that even if Europe is unable to stand for what&apos;s right and offer its strength behind Ukraine, well, maybe then you will have a group of like-minded countries that would at least try and do that. I&apos;m not very optimistic about (Europe&#x2019;s ability to offer what the U.S. can&#x2019;t). It would depend on the leadership (of European nations) because it requires very difficult decisions. And we&apos;ve been stuck in the past trying to figure out even way more simple equations &#x2013; we are unable to do that. But I hope, seeing from the public space, there are a lot of people who do understand what&apos;s at stake. They do understand that it&apos;s not just the Ukrainian future at stake, but it could very well be a European future at stake. Lithuania&apos;s former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis at Munich Security Conference 2024 in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)We have been asking, so that, for example, at least a representative of Nordic and Baltic countries would be present in any sort of talks. Because the Nordics and Baltics, we assisted Ukraine more than Germany &#x2013; several times more than Poland. I think it would be understandable if at least one representative from the northern region would also be present. Because if Ukraine is unable to win, the next step &#x2013; and President Zelensky has said this &#x2013; we are in danger. Our region is in danger. So it&apos;s our future that is being decided in those talks as well. I think that everybody was surprised yesterday to find out that the talks are already happening, that the summit is being organized, that Ukraine is not being involved. Europe is at least three steps behind. We (in Europe) are already divided, and it&apos;s just the first steps. And it&apos;s not just about who&apos;s at the table, it&apos;s what we bring to that table. What kind of leverage? Can Europe realistically offer troops to Ukraine? Can we realistically offer security guarantees, weapons? Can we really do that? If not, then even sitting at the table would not make any difference. From my perspective, it is potentially the biggest crisis for Europe since World War II. People do say that Europe is forged in crisis, that it becomes stronger or it breaks down. So this is yet to be determined. I really don&apos;t think (that Putin would seriously consider any peace talks). Putin might try to convince Trump that he is eager to negotiate, but at the same time, he will be doing everything he wants or can. Peace talks would need to begin at the battlefield, with Ukraine having a stronger hand, where Ukraine would be able to actually start pushing and increasing pressure on Russians. This is how some success at the negotiating table could be achieved. Now, Ukraine is not put in a stronger position, so basically, what happened yesterday is a push for capitulation of Ukraine. (But some countries have not understood this), and this is where my pessimism comes from, because we had the chance. Ukraine gave us the time to do what&apos;s right. And we didn&apos;t do it. So it is difficult for me to expect now that we will change the way that we operate. Researcher, Latvian Institute of International Affairs board member, Latvian Transatlantic Organization &#x201C;No action, only talk and tweet&#x201D; &#x2014; this is European security cooperation. Three decades after the Cold War&#x2019;s end, the U.S.&#x2019; annual defense budget stands at $970 billion, while Europe spends only half that amount. This is the European security approach, despite Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war against Ukraine for the past 10 years, its continued occupation of Georgian territory, and its persistent meddling in Western democratic processes, including the U.S. It is hardly surprising that the U.S. continues to lead security talks with Russia, even when the security of Ukraine and Europe is at stake. This is the direct outcome of Europe&#x2019;s heavy emphasis on harsh words, followed by light or no action at all. However, past transatlantic discord has often catalyzed stronger European cooperation. To sustain any form of security architecture or a rules-based international order, Europe must act now &#x2014; arming Ukraine before any potential Trump-Putin deal reshapes the balance of power. Security is very practical &#x2013; you have it or not. The ball is on Europe&#x2019;s turf. Estonia&#x2019;s ambassador to Ukraine Estonian position has, of course, not changed. We have always stated that before any negotiations, Ukraine must be strengthened because Putin understands only strength. Europe, its allies, the West &#x2013; we all have the means to actually corner Russia. We can use sanctions, sanction Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet, use frozen assets, not only the profits of the frozen assets, but the assets themselves. They have to show Putin that time is not on his side. It&apos;s the opposite. Russia&#x2019;s economy is collapsing, and Europe really must strengthen the military aid to Ukraine, political help, everything. Anneli Kolk, Ambassador of the Republic of Estonia to Ukraine, gives an interview to a Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Vitalii Nosach / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)Ukraine has to start from a really strong position, and rushing into any negotiations right now without giving Ukraine security guarantees is not right. It&apos;s not timely. And we don&apos;t see any signs from Putin&apos;s side to change their goals. And we don&apos;t think that Putin will change (Russia&apos;s) goals during the possible negotiations. We haven&apos;t strengthened, to be honest, Ukraine within these three years enough. (To sufficiently strengthen Ukraine, Europe) needs political will. In my opinion, of course, Putin would be ready for any negotiations, but it doesn&apos;t mean that he is sincere or that he will keep his promises. We have seen over the history that Russia has always violated all the agreements that Russia has been part of. Anything that Putin is saying or promising &#x2013; high doubts on all of that. He only understands the language of strength, and this is the moment now that we really need to strengthen up our military and help Ukraine. So Ukraine can be the one who can demand returning to 1991 borders and reparations and all this. If it&apos;s about Europe, I think all Europeans have to have a seat at the table. We also have European Union institutions who can represent the EU. But there are other countries from Europe who are not part of the EU. But I have all the confidence in President Zelensky&apos;s words that he will also be doing the negotiations with Europe. Political analyst and deputy director of Polish public institution Mieroszewski Center I&apos;m not surprised that peace negotiations have begun. I was surprised at the way the U.S. diplomacy is conducting this negotiation. They are not going to accept Ukraine into NATO or insist on Ukraine&#x2019;s full territorial integrity. They are going to visit Putin in Moscow or invite Putin to Washington. I don&apos;t know the details, but it&apos;s not the way we should handle war with Russia. The picture is emerging that Trump is trying to handle a certain deal with Putin, reckoning on the short-term gains and presence in Ukraine of American enterprises and perhaps also if he is interested in exploring Ukrainian mineral resources. But Trump has no vision of how to ensure this peace, how to make this peace durable, and trust for Ukraine. The future of Europe depends on the ability of European society and European nations to mobilize themselves to spend more on defense. If we fail to do it, unfortunately, within the last three years, there were only several countries that drew conclusions from the war. There is a possibility that Trump&apos;s politics would lead to a major war between European nations and Russia. I don&apos;t know whether it would happen because, as I said, it depends on the ability of European nations to mobilize themselves and spend more on defense. It also depends on Putin himself and the economic condition of the Russian regime. Estonia&apos;s former foreign minister (2022-2023), defense minister (2012-2014), justice minister (2015-2019) I have to admit, unfortunately, that the launch of these negotiations is not promising. Europe needs to define immediately its position regarding negotiations, also assuring that representatives of the free European continent are around the table and together with Ukraine, which is a victim state. (And also define) that we will not let these negotiations result in a certain Minsk 3 outcome. To avoid that, Europe also needs to reflect back on yesterday&apos;s remarks from the U.S. administration. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu speaks to the press during a meeting of EU foreign ministers at the EU Council headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on March 20, 2023. (Dursun Aydemir / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)First, if we are seeking a sustainable security architecture of Europe, then that requires a NATO membership for Ukraine. Secondly, if we are speaking about possible security measures for Ukraine, then that ought to be in the sake of transatlantic security perspective, (which) also (includes) U.S. troops. And thirdly, Europe needs to show determination, not rhetorically, not verbally, but in practice. We should not over-panic (about the possibility of the war in Ukraine spilling over). NATO is a functional alliance, and it remains that way. Editor-in-chief and political analyst heading Warsaw-based think tank Visegrad Insight&apos;s policy analysis on European affairs There is vocal opposition, like Donald Tusk, prime minister of Poland, who called on the U.S. to work together with the EU on the peace plan and emphasize just peace, which represents a perspective on keeping the territorial integrity of Ukraine. You may expect that the Baltic leaders share identical mindsets and would solely support this approach. However, Robert Fico of Slovakia expressed full endorsement of the potential appeasement while simultaneously taking a swing at the EU and Ukraine in a Facebook comment featuring a recent photo of himself with (Vladimir) Putin. A very similar position can be anticipated from Hungary, where the Foreign Ministry has backed Trump&apos;s efforts, and Viktor Orban is likely to embrace a Trump-Putin agreement should it occur. Overall, Eastern Europe and the Baltics have a clear mindset regarding a potential &quot;deal&quot; with Putin and harbor no illusions that, regardless of the narrative, any potential pause in hostilities would merely offer Putin an opportunity to reload and prepare for new aggression in the western direction. This is a frightening prospect that drives high defense spending in this part of the EU, as well as increasing pressure on the rest of the EU to boost their spending as well. head of the Security Policy Program at the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, diplomatic adviser to Latvia&#x2019;s defense minister The main thing is that Ukraine must be involved in any peace talk discussions. The most important thing is that Ukraine is engaged in any discussions about its fate. I think it was very important that President Donald Trump briefed President Volodymyr Zelensky after his call with President Vladimir Putin. It&#x2019;s positive that your president was informed immediately afterward and was able to make his points about how he sees the process evolving. But many things are unclear at this point. My sense at the moment is that the U.S. is open to discussing the views of allies, including Latvia, about how this process should proceed. And given that Latvia, together with Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland, already have over 3% of their GDP devoted to defense and are willing to increase their defense budgets to meet both their own security and the collective security of NATO allies, this does give us the possibility to express our views more strongly. And the indication is that we will be perhaps listened to more by our U.S. partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-push-for-ukraines-capitulation-baltic-eastern-europe-react-to-trumps-rush-to-negotiate-peace-with-putin/	2025-02-13T13:11:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1664006058.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia preparing delegation for US talks on war with Kyiv, Kremlin says	Key developments on Feb. 13: Russia has started forming a group for talks with the United States, including on the war with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media on Feb. 13. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during telephone talks to instruct aides to prepare for a face-to-face meeting immediately. Peskov noted that Moscow will consider the Minsk agreement&apos;s experience in future negotiations. &quot;Of course, the experience of the Minsk agreements is very eloquent, and we will always take this experience into account in all further steps,&quot; he said. The Minsk agreements, signed in 2014 and 2015 after Russian military offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donbas, failed to bring lasting peace. Moscow violated the terms, using them as leverage to push for greater autonomy for Russian-occupied territories while maintaining its influence over Ukraine. Peskov also said Russia has yet to determine which countries might participate in potential talks and confirmed no contact with European nations on the matter. &quot;There is no understanding yet of the format of a possible dialogue or negotiation process,&quot; he said. According to the Kremlin spokesperson, Kyiv &quot;will definitely take part in the negotiations in one way or another,&quot; but there will also be a &quot;bilateral Russian-American track.&quot; Zelensky and Trump agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Zelensky said that he wants European partners to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending of Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Lipetsk Oblast came under a &quot;massive raid&quot; by drones on the night of Feb. 13, regional governor Igor Artamonov said. The drones allegedly targeted the Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK), Russia&apos;s largest steel mill, which produces about 20% of the country&apos;s steel output, according to pro-Kremlin media outlet Shot. The facility, located around 400 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border, accounts for 80% of NLMK&apos;s steel production and is a key asset of Russian billionaire Vladimir Lisin, the third richest Russian on Forbes&apos; 2023 list. Following the overnight attack, power outages were reported in several districts of Lipetsk. &quot;At the moment, power engineers are reconnecting consumers,&quot; Artamonov wrote on Telegram. Debris from one of the downed drones reportedly fell on the Lipetsk aeration station, injuring an employee who was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The U.S. will continue providing security assistance to Ukraine, and NATO is assuming a greater role in supporting the country, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Feb. 13 during a joint speech with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &quot;The U.S. is with us, also continuing (to provide) security assistance. NATO is taking over our security assistance and (military) training,&quot; Umerov said. Rutte expressed his strong belief in the necessity of continuing military assistance to Ukraine, particularly to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in potential peace talks. Umerov made the remarks in Brussels, before the start of the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting, which will be held in a lunch format. Ukrainian drones hit the Andreapol oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast for the second time in two weeks overnight on Feb. 13, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the oil pumping station that came under the SBU&apos;s attack is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2 operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. The attack caused a fire near a closed switchgear and boiler equipment warehouse, the source said, forcing the facility to suspend oil pumping. The station is located around 750 kilometers (466 miles) north of Ukrainian border. &quot;Every day this oil pumping station&apos;s idle time costs Russia tens of millions of dollars , since it is part of the pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal on the Baltic Sea,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Ukraine War Latest is put together by the Kyiv Independent news desk team, who keep you informed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Russia should be readmitted into G7, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 13 that he would &quot;love&quot; to see Russia readmitted into the Group of Seven (G7), calling Russia&apos;s 2014 expulsion from the group a &quot;mistake.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out.&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;Look, it&apos;s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia. It was the G8,&quot; Trump said, referring to the former name of the international forum. Then-Group of Eight (G8) countries expelled Russia from the group in 2014 after it invaded parts of eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine with military and financial aid. In October 2024, the G7 reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The United States agreed to contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. Trump&apos;s comments to reporters comes a day after he held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes and Putin invited Trump to Moscow. Shortly after Trump&#x2019;s call with Putin, he and President Volodymyr Zelensky had held a phone call. Amid concerns over a lack of Ukrainian involvement in upcoming peace negotiation, when asked by reporters in the White House as to whether Ukraine would have a seat at the negotiating table, Trump replied &quot;yes, of course.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-should-be-readmitted-into-g7-trump-says/	2025-02-13T12:31:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
A ‘very bloody war:' What is the death toll of Russia’s war in Ukraine?	After holding a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, U.S. President Donald Trump once again claimed the &quot;horrible, very bloody war&quot; in Ukraine had cost &quot;millions&quot; of lives. It&#x2019;s not the first time Trump has claimed that such numbers of people have been killed in the war. &quot;We have numbers that almost a million Russian soldiers have been killed,&quot; Trump said in January, adding that &quot;about 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers are killed.&quot; But calculating the total number of deaths &#x2014; both civilian and military &#x2014; is complicated as Russia seldom comments on its battlefield losses, Ukraine has only recently begun releasing official information on its figures, and civilian deaths in occupied areas of Ukraine are largely unknown. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians stands at 147,459. The true number of Ukrainians and Russians who have been killed, however, is almost certainly far higher. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine has lost 45,100 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Speaking in an interview with British journalist Piers Morgan published on Feb. 4, Zelensky said that there have also been a total of 390,000 cases of injuries on the battlefield. The true number of wounded soldiers is less given that some soldiers sustained multiple wounds in separate cases. Kyiv largely avoided commenting on its losses for the first two years of the full-scale war, until Zelensky announced in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.

(Yuriy Dyachyshyn / AFP / Getty Images)At the time, he refrained from detailing how many soldiers had been wounded, &quot;because Russia will then know how many people have left the battlefield.&quot; The numbers provided by Zelensky do not include the Ukrainian soldiers killed between 2022 and 2014, when Russia began its war against Ukraine. According to an estimation by U.N., 4,400 Ukrainian soldiers were killed during this period. Zelensky also told Morgan that it was not clear how many Ukrainians are currently held as prisoners of war compared to those missing in action. &quot;How many of those are missing (in action) and how many of those are prisoners (of war), I do not know the precise number but we are working on it,&quot; Zelensky added. Though there are no official figures on how many Ukrainian soldiers are being held as POWs in Russia, to date over 4,000 Ukrainians have been returned home in prisoner swaps, according to the latest figures from Ukraine&#x2019;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. This number includes both military personnel and civilians. Russia has lost over 850,000 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the latest figures by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. While Ukraine&#x2019;s figures do not specify killed or wounded, the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. For comparison, the U.K. suffered 750,000 military casualties during the six years of World War II. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 30 that 427,000 casualties, or more than half of the total figure, occurred in 2024 alone, with troop losses reaching record levels in November and December as Russia stepped up its assaults in Donetsk Oblast. The accelerated casualties suffered by Russia continued into 2025. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Khortytsia group of forces, Russia lost more soldiers fighting in the direction of Pokrovsk, a small city in Donetsk Oblast, than its total losses in the Second Chechen War. Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone.

(Jose Colon / Anadolu / Getty Images)The last time Russia publicly released figures on its military death toll was September 2022, when the Kremlin claimed just 5,937 men had been killed fighting in Ukraine. More realistic estimates come from an ongoing research project by Mediazona, an independent Russian outlet, working with BBC Russia. The outlets have so far confirmed through open-source data the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. The true military death toll is the subject of intense media debate. In December 2024, Zelensky disputed reports that as many as 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed during the full-scale war. Zelensky&apos;s comments likely referred to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s claims published in September that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with a further 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at as many as to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The Economist published a similar estimation in November that between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. Another 400,000 were too injured to fight on, according to the Economist&#x2019;s estimates. The figures suggest that almost one in 20 fighting-age men in Ukraine have been killed or injured because of Russia&#x2019;s war. &quot;I want to tell you that, no, (the number of those killed is) less, much less,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News published on Dec. 1, while refusing to provide a detailed number of casualties. &quot;However, we have to be honest, we do not know how many Ukrainians have been killed on occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added. According to U.N. statistics from the end of 2024, over 12,340 civilian deaths have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. More than 27,836 Ukrainians were also recorded as wounded during that period. According to the U.N., aerial bombs and long-range weapons caused a greater number of casualties in 2024 than in the previous year. However, the U.N. figures consist mostly of Ukrainian civilians who have been killed in either areas of Ukraine under Kyiv&#x2019;s control &#x2014; for example in Russian drone and missile attacks on cities like Kharkiv, Kyiv, or Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; or in areas of Ukraine that were occupied, but have since been liberated, like Kherson.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Civilians killed in areas that have remained under Russian occupation are not part of the official figures, as the U.N. has not been able to access these areas to verify all deaths. This includes cities like Mariupol, for example. The U.N. officials who compiled the figures told the Kyiv Independent that they had managed to verify around 2,100 civilian deaths in the city. An estimate by Human Rights Watch based on satellite images of mass graves said at least 8,000 civilians had been killed in Mariupol, but noted that the true figure was likely significantly higher. These figures also only include those who died in the first months of the full-scale invasion, during the intense siege and battle for the city. The estimate does not include those who died later from the conditions imposed by Russian occupying forces, which left the city with little functioning infrastructure. Ukraine considers 60,000 of its citizens have gone missing during the war. The missing person count does not include over 19,500 Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-very-bloody-war-what-is-the-death-toll-of-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-02-13T12:00:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2053061232.jpg
Recognizing Ukraine won't restore pre-2014 borders 'not a concession' to Putin, Hegseth says	Recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is not a concession to Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a briefing in Brussels on Feb. 13. Hegseth made comments on Feb. 12 that Ukraine is unlikely to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Experts and officials in Ukraine and Europe have criticized Hegseth&apos;s comments for undermining Ukraine&apos;s leverage before peace talks with Russia have even started. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and occupied Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. &quot;I think realism is an important part of the conversation that hasn&apos;t existed enough inside conversations amongst friends, but simply pointing out realism like the borders won&apos;t be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,&quot; Hegseth said. &quot;It&apos;s a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice first by the Ukrainians and then by allies.&quot; Previously, Hegseth also said the U.S. does not believe that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. President Donald Trump soon said that he did not believe Ukraine joining the alliance was practical. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition to Ukraine&apos;s accession from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. Trump held separate calls with Putin and Zelensky on Feb. 12, later claiming both leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Trump called Putin first, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending of Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/recognizing-that-ukraine-wont-restore-pre-2014-borders-not-a-concession-to-putin-hegseth-says/	2025-02-13T11:58:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199399272.jpg
EU-Ukraine agri-trade reaches record $17 billion in 2024	Agricultural trade between Ukraine and the EU reached $17 billion in 2024, exceeding the previous record of $16.5 billion in 2022 by 3%, the Kyiv-based research Institute of Agrarian Economics (IAE) reported. The trade volume is the highest since the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was signed in 2014, said Mykola Puhachov, deputy director of IAE. The EU is Ukraine&apos;s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 65% of its total agri-food exports in 2023. In 2024, Ukraine&apos;s largest trade partners were Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Romania, France, and Belgium, which accounted for 80% of its agrifood trade turnover, the IAE said. Ukraine imported about $4 billion worth of agricultural products from EU member states, almost 9% more than in 2023, according to the IAE. Despite the challenging context of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Ukrainian agricultural exports to the EU exceeded imports by $9 billion last year. Agricultural economics expert Oleg Nivievskyi told the Kyiv Independent that exports likely increased due to rising prices, as this year&apos;s harvest was not significantly higher than the previous year. &#xA0; &quot;This year, the EU&apos;s export corridor with Ukraine is functioning better. After the full-scale Russian invasion began, the EU abolished tariff quotas on Ukrainian agricultural products to facilitate exports from Ukraine as trade by sea was blocked by Russia. This measure has increased the EU&apos;s share of Ukraine&apos;s overall trade,&quot; Nivievskyi said. According to a report on agri-food trade between Ukraine and the EU, in 2023, Ukraine exports mainly cereals, vegetable and animal oils, and ferrous metals. &#xA0; After the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s previously dominant share of its non-agri-food exports declined significantly. However, agri-food products remained almost at pre-war levels, significantly supporting the Ukrainian economy, the report shows.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ukraine-agri-trade-reaches-record-17-billion-in-2024/	2025-02-13T11:43:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1242310109.jpeg
European stock and currencies rise on Ukraine peace deal hopes, Reuters reports	Europe&apos;s main stock market and currencies are gaining amid growing optimism about a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Reuters reported on Feb. 13. U.S. President Donald Trump held phone calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian&apos;s Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, Feb. 12, saying that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Reuters reported that the STOXX 600, Europe&apos;s key stock index, reached new highs, extending its 8% growth already achieved this year and reaching a new record high. The growth was mainly buoyed by gains in Nestle and Siemens, in addition to talks of a peace deal. The euro grew by 0.3% at $1.041, while the Swiss franc and Britain&apos;s pound gained the same percentage against the dollar, amounting to $1.102 and $1.248, respectively. A peace settlement in Ukraine would be &apos;significantly positive&apos; for Europe, potentially lowering energy costs and enabling reconstruction programs reminiscent of the Marshall Plan, ING currency expert Chris Turner told Reuters. &#xA0; Ukraine&apos;s government bonds continued to rise on the peace talk hopes, despite the fear among top European politicians that a deal was being forced on Kyiv and Europe would be left to shoulder the costs of post-war security and reconstruction in Ukraine. Oil prices declined on the potential for a negotiated settlement of the war in Ukraine for the second day on Feb.13.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-stock-and-currencies-rose-on-ukraine-peace-deal-hopes-reuters-reports/	2025-02-13T11:35:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198493013.jpg
‘Totally screwed’ — How Trump, Hegseth are damaging Ukraine in talks with Russia	After promising to quickly resolve the war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump and his top officials&#x2019; actions on Feb. 12 appeared to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s leverage in peace talks, renewing fears that his plans for a quick resolution could amount to a victory for Russia. Trump announced he had held phone calls with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying peace negotiations would start &quot;immediately&quot; and a ceasefire is in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; Earlier in the day, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said &quot;returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,&quot; and that NATO membership for Ukraine is not an option. By conceding leverage points before negotiations have formally started, Trump&#x2019;s team has &quot;totally screwed their own negotiating position,&quot; Timothy Ash, an associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Program, told the Kyiv independent. &quot;Why, even before negotiations start, would you give away your negotiating leverage?&quot; Ash said. &quot;We might ultimately agree that NATO is not appropriate at this time, or maybe never, but it&apos;s a card that Trump could have used in negotiations. Similarly with territory. Trump could have played hardball.&quot; &quot;It seemed like a rookie error,&quot; Ash added. For many in Ukraine, the U.S. voicing concessions on territory and NATO membership &#x2014; before conducting any formal negotiations involving Ukraine &#x2014; amounted to a betrayal by a key ally. &quot;This means that we cannot trust our partners,&quot; said Petro Andryushchenko, former Mariupol mayoral advisor and head of the Center for the Study of Occupation. &quot;This is exactly what the president (Zelensky) means when he says, &#x2018;If we are not accepted into NATO, we have to build NATO here.&#x2019;&quot; Territorial concessions are particularly devastating for those living in difficult conditions under occupation, Andryushchenko said, as they will have to face the idea that they will never rejoin Ukraine. Roughly one fifth of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory is occupied by Russia, with Russian forces still advancing slowly in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainians living under occupation experience &quot;widespread&quot; human rights violations, the UN has found, including threats, unlawful imprisonment, and torture. &quot;Imagine being under occupation, helping to believe in liberation, helping with your every step, your life, reporting information about the presence of Russian troops, their behavior &#x2014; important things that bring us closer to victory. And now you are told that no, you are not needed, you are there forever,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it destroys the whole basis of democracy and the building of the world after the Second World War.&quot; Evacuees from Pokrovsk arrive at an evacuation point outside the city in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Dec. 14, 2024, as Russian troops advance nearby.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Since taking office, Trump has had significant military, financial, and diplomatic options at his disposal that could be used against Russia to extract better terms for Ukraine. Oleksandr Merezhko, a top member of parliament from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party, disputed Hegseth&#x2019;s comment that restoring Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-war borders was &quot;unrealistic,&quot; calling the prospect &quot;absolutely realistic&quot; if more were done to pressure Russia. Trump himself had earlier floated the idea of applying high tariffs and sanctions to Russia&#x2019;s struggling economy if a peace deal was not achieved. &quot;To (restore the borders), Ukraine needs to get enough contemporary weaponry which would allow it to have, at a minimum, parity with Russia on the battlefield. Additionally, the use of serious financial sanctions against Russia&#x2019;s banking and financial system could have paralyzed the Russian war machine,&quot; Merezhko said. &quot;Regrettably, we don&#x2019;t see that yet.&quot; Not all were surprised by Hegseth&#x2019;s comments. John Foreman, the former British ambassador to Moscow, told the Kyiv Independent that they revealed an &quot;ultra-realist approach.&quot; &quot;The Americans aren&#x2019;t prepared to put NATO troops into Ukraine. We know that, because if they had, they would have done it in 2022. And de facto, Ukraine&#x2019;s going to lose land as part of any peace deal, because Ukraine can&#x2019;t push the Russians out,&quot; said Foreman. &quot;I can see why it&#x2019;s gone down badly in Kyiv, and amongst some European capitals. But to be honest, you shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised.&quot; The phone call with Putin is still significant, Foreman noted, in terms of signalling how the discussions are being carried out &#x2014; with Trump speaking directly to Putin without other American allies present. President Joe Biden previously cut all direct communication with Putin after the 2022 invasion. &quot;The Russians have got what they really wanted as a start &#x2014; direct conversation with America, over the head of the Europeans, and over, perhaps, the head of the Ukrainians,&quot; said Foreman. European leaders &#x2014; suddenly left out of discussions after nearly three years of close involvement with the U.S. on Ukraine-related issues under President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration &#x2014; &#xA0;scrambled to react to Trump&#x2019;s comments. Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, said: &quot;Why are we giving (Russia) everything they want, even before negotiations have started? &#x2026; If there is an agreement made behind our backs, it simply will not work.&quot; U.S. Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth arrives for his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on Jan. 14, 2025.

(Tatyana Makeyeva / AFP / Getty Images)European officials are concerned that they might be left to shoulder the costs of Ukraine&#x2019;s post-war reconstruction and security after being excluded from the discussions between Trump and Putin, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 13. Six European countries released a statement with Ukraine and the European Commission following Trump&#x2019;s comments, that read: &quot;Our shared objectives should be to put Ukraine in a position of strength. Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.&quot; The statement also committed to Ukraine&#x2019;s independence and territorial integrity. Germany, France, the U.K., Poland, Italy, and Spain signed the statement. Within the U.S. as well, Trump and Hegseth&#x2019;s comments provoked backlash from some officials. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal called Hegseth&#x2019;s message a &quot;surrender and betrayal&quot; of Ukraine, while Senator Adam B. Schiff also condemned Hegseth&#x2019;s comments and criticized Trump for calling Putin before he spoke with Zelensky. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, told CNN: &quot;Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin before the negotiations have even begun.&quot; The terms quoted by Hegseth &quot;could have been written in the Kremlin,&quot; Bolton added. Hegseth pushed back on claims that a swift negotiation would be a &#x201C;betrayal&#x201D; at a press conference in Brussels, the Guardian reported. &#x201C;There is no betrayal &#x2014; there is a recognition that the whole world and the U.S. is invested in peace, in a negotiated peace,&#x201D; he said. Trump&#x2019;s calls to Putin and Zelensky have nonetheless set the stage for talks to end the Ukraine war, signaling a new phase after nearly three years of war. No negotiations have taken place since the war&#x2019;s early months. Zelensky is expected to meet with several top U.S. officials in the next few days at the Munich Security Conference from February 14-16. According to the President&#x2019;s Office, Trump&apos;s Ukraine and Russia envoy Keith Kellogg and Vice President JD Vance are among those he is planning to meet. Kellogg is also scheduled to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20. Trump has said he may meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia and plans to meet Zelensky soon, though did not provide details.	https://kyivindependent.com/totally-screwed-how-trump-hegseth-are-damaging-ukraine-in-talks-with-russia/	2025-02-13T10:57:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukrainian drones again hit oil pumping station in Russia's Tver Oblast, SBU source claims	Ukrainian drones hit the Andreapol oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast for the second time in two weeks overnight on Feb. 13, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the oil pumping station that came under the SBU&apos;s attack is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2 operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. The attack caused a fire near a closed switchgear and boiler equipment warehouse, the source said, forcing the facility to suspend oil pumping. The station is located around 750 kilometers (466 miles) north of Ukrainian border. &quot;Every day this oil pumping station&apos;s idle time costs Russia tens of millions of dollars , since it is part of the pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal on the Baltic Sea,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. If confirmed, this is the second drone attack on the facility. The first one was carried on Jan. 29, damaging the filtration pumping area and additive tanks at the station, a source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-again-hit-oil-pumping-station-in-russias-tver-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-02-13T09:59:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2151793922.jpg
Europe can no longer view Trump’s foreign policy through a binary lens	Like people in other regions, Europeans face the challenge of discerning what motives underlie U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s verbal provocations. After all, what Trump really wants is often unclear, which makes it difficult to devise a strategically effective response. Traditionally, Europeans have interpreted American foreign policy through a binary lens: either a U.S. administration is Atlanticist, in which case all is well (for the most part); or it is isolationist, which spells trouble. But Trump fits neither category. He is certainly no Atlanticist, because he is convinced that NATO offers insufficient benefits for what it costs the United States, and that Europeans are all free riders. But he is hardly the first American leader to make this criticism. U.S. complaints about European free riding date to at least to the early 1950s, when NATO was just taking shape. The difference between Trump and his predecessors is that he puts a much higher price tag on American protection and views it as something that Europeans do not really deserve. But nor is Trump an isolationist, though many commentators describe him in these terms. Trump does not think only in crude transactional terms. He believes that America is owed all the perks of hegemony, but with none of the costs. Rather than an isolationist, he is an imperial nationalist, like many nineteenth-century American leaders. Even his preferred policy instruments for ushering in a &#x201C;golden age,&#x201D; tariffs and territorial expansion, recall that era. For Europeans, both seem absurd today. But from an American point of view, they have a historical resonance. America&#x2019;s war for independence began with a conflict over tariffs, which have since been seen as an instrument of sovereignty. The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world whose constitution explicitly mentions trade. Even if tariffs tend to harm domestic consumers, they serve a political function. This is reflected in Trump&#x2019;s proposal to create a new &#x201C;External Revenue Service&#x201D; which would centralize tariff administration and serve as a depository for tariff revenues. With such an agency, Trump would have the means to redistribute revenues among states and political clients as he wished. He pursued a similar strategy during his first term when he established a fund within the Department of Agriculture to compensate those harmed by China&#x2019;s retaliatory measures against American soybean exporters. But the most important objective, of course, is to use tariffs to exert pressure on partners that are particularly dependent on the U.S. market: Mexico, Canada, and Europe. In the case of Canada and Greenland (an autonomous Danish territory), Trump has also expressed territorial ambitions, wishing to &#x201C;get Greenland&#x201D; and make Canada the &#x201C;51st state.&#x201D; Commercial pressure is thus a means of achieving territorial expansion, just as it was for the U.S. in the 19th century. In pining for an American geostrategic fortress stretching from Greenland to Mexico, Trump is unwittingly echoing a U.S. State Department document from the middle of the 19th century which stated that the acquisition of Greenland would &#x201C;flank British North America for thousands of miles on the north and west, and greatly increase her inducements, peacefully and cheerfully, to become a part of the American Union.&#x201D; An aircraft allegedly carrying Donald Trump Jr. arrives in Nuuk, Greenland, on Jan. 7, 2025. (Emil Stach / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP / Getty Images)Europe has understandably been left in a state of shock by Trump&#x2019;s decidedly non-Atlanticist, non-isolationist geopolitical project. What can be done? Should we simply pray that it will not happen? That, more or less, has been the response from the European Union&#x2019;s new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas. In one of her first public statements, she said little about the threat from America, because she is primarily concerned with just one issue: maintaining transatlantic solidarity to confront Russia in Ukraine. But laudable though this objective may be, it takes two to tango. Meanwhile, no European official has bothered to mention the EU&#x2019;s Anti-Coercion Instrument, which permits retaliatory tariffs to be imposed against any state that would use trade restrictions for geopolitical purposes. If Trump decides to intensify his pressure on Denmark through high tariffs, the EU will have no choice but to trigger this mechanism. To do otherwise would be to confirm &#x2014; and exacerbate &#x2014; its own geopolitical weakness. For the same reason, the Danish government is wrong to play the appeasement card. Obviously, the balance of power is not in its favor. But by making no secret of its fear, it is inviting Trump to be even more aggressive. While it does not make sense for Europe to deploy troops to Greenland &#x2014; which would either look ridiculous or create the possibility of a war with the U.S. &#x2014; nor does it make sense to grovel. Whatever happens, Russia is the biggest winner for now. While Europeans hem and haw, no one should be surprised if the White House and the Kremlin negotiate the future of Ukraine behind closed doors.

US is Russia's 'main counterpart' in talks to end war, Kremlin says	Moscow believes that the U.S. is its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Channel One on Feb. 13. According to Peskov, Kyiv &quot;will definitely take part in the negotiations in one way or another,&quot; but there will also be a &quot;bilateral Russian-American track.&quot; His statement came after Trump held separate calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12, later claiming both leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Trump called Putin first, saying later that the two leaders agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; Earlier on Feb. 13, Peskov claimed that Russia has started forming a group for talks with the U.S., including on the war with Ukraine. Peskov also said that the two did not discuss the possible participation of Europe in the peace talks during their conversation. &quot;Probably, it will be up to the Europeans to talk to Washington to somehow secure their place,&quot; he added. Trump also announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the talks remains unclear. Zelensky and Trump agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Zelensky said that he wants European partners to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending of Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-is-russias-main-counterpart-in-talks-to-end-war-kremlin-says/	2025-02-13T08:26:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Not very pleasant' — Zelensky comments on Trump calling Putin first	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 13 it &quot;was not very pleasant&quot; that U.S. President Donald Trump first held a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before calling Zelensky, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. A day earlier, Trump held separate calls with Zelensky and Putin, later claiming both leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky and Trump agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Zelensky described the conversation with his U.S. counterpart as &quot;good.&quot; He said that Trump didn&apos;t tell him that &quot;Putin and Russia were a priority.&quot; &quot;Today we trust these words. It is very important for us to maintain the support of the United States,&quot; Zelensky added. &quot;I don&apos;t perceive this call as it was a priority that he (Trump) talked to Russia first. Although it&apos;s not very pleasant in any case because you know how Ukrainian society, Europeans react: nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.&quot; According to Zelensky, Kyiv&apos;s priority is the Ukraine-U.S. meeting, as well as the development of a plan &quot;to stop Putin.&quot; &quot;I think it&apos;s only fair to talk to the Russians after that,&quot; the president said, adding that he wants European partners to be involved in negotiations. Previously, Trump announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the talks remains unclear. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 13 that Russia has started forming a group for talks with the U.S., including on the war with Ukraine.

NATO 'taking over' Ukraine's security assistance, military training, Umerov says	The U.S. will continue providing security assistance to Ukraine, and NATO is assuming a greater role in supporting the country, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Feb. 13 during a joint speech with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &quot;The U.S. is with us, also continuing (to provide) security assistance. NATO is taking over our security assistance and (military) training,&quot; Umerov said. The remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty over U.S. aid commitments to Ukraine. President Donald Trump has suggested that assistance could be tied to trade agreements, including access to &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Rutte expressed his strong belief in the necessity of continuing military assistance to Ukraine, particularly to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in potential peace talks. Umerov made the remarks in Brussels, before the start of the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting, which will be held in a lunch format. Umerov began his work at the 26th Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12. The session, led by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, focused on defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing European arms supplies to Ukraine. On Feb. 12, Umerov also met with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on the summit&apos;s sidelines for the first time. Typically, Ramstein summits include announcements of fresh military aid for Kyiv, but the Washington Post reported that Hegseth is participating in a &quot;listening mode&quot; and is not expected to commit new assistance. The UDCG, comprising over 50 countries, including all NATO members, meets regularly to coordinate military support for Ukraine. The NATO-Ukraine Council coincides with other key events, including the Munich Security Conference, where Ukraine&apos;s future security assistance will be a key topic of discussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-takes-over-ukraines-security-assistance-training-umerov-says/	2025-02-13T05:44:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2451.jpg
Trump says talks with Zelensky, Putin were 'great,' optimistic about ending 'very bloody war'	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 13 described recent talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;great&quot; and expressed optimism about ending the war. &quot;Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war,&quot; Trump wrote on Truth Social. On Feb. 12, Trump held separate calls with Zelensky and Putin, later claiming both leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky and Trump agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Trump also announced that he and Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the talks remains unclear. The U.S. president said he had instructed a team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to oversee negotiations. Russia has begun forming a negotiating team for talks with the U.S., including on the war with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 13. Elsewhere, Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation to the Munich Security Conference, where Trump&apos;s team is expected to present its diplomatic strategy. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio will meet Zelensky in Munich on Feb. 14 to begin official talks, Trump added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-talks-with-zelensky-and-putin-great-optimistic-about-ending-war/	2025-02-13T05:00:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
EU cannot replace USAID funding but sees opportunity to boost visibility, Kallas says	The European Union cannot fully replace U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding but sees the situation as an opportunity to make its aid more visible, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said, ENR reported on Feb. 13. &quot;We agreed that we are not automatically filling the void with European money because, first, we don&apos;t have those funds,&quot; Kallas said. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration has ordered a three-month freeze on nearly all international development funding and reportedly plans to lay off most of USAID&#x2019;s global workforce. The White House has accused the agency of widespread waste and fraud, despite foreign aid making up just 1% of the federal budget. The White House has accused the agency of widespread waste and fraud, despite foreign aid comprising only 1% of the federal budget. Kallas emphasized that EU funding will be more explicitly linked to recipients in the future, ensuring they understand the support comes from Europe. She said that the EU supports many organizations with substantial funds, but its presence is scarcely visible, adding that this is an opportunity to make the European flag more prominent. Last week, USAID was placed under the control of the U.S. State Department, and crews were seen removing its signage from the agency&apos;s Washington headquarters on Feb. 7. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-unable-to-fully-replace-usaid-funds-aims-to-boost-visibility-kallas-says/	2025-02-13T04:11:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2095061245.jpg
Dmytro Kuleba: Trump’s rare earth deal risks Ukraine repeating history’s mistakes	On Feb. 10, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that he aimed to secure &#x201C;$500 billion worth of rare earth&#x201D; minerals as part of negotiations over continued U.S. support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia. When history repeats itself, it&#x2019;s time to reflect. At the beginning of 1918, amid World War I, Germany and Austria-Hungary were in dire need of natural resources. Simply put, they needed grain, lard, meat, and oil to sustain their war efforts and economies. Ukraine, having recently declared independence from the Russian Empire and fighting to secure its sovereignty, possessed all of these resources. Seeing an opportunity, Germany intervened. As U.S. President Donald Trump might have said if he had lived 100 years ago, it was a great deal. Under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German troops entered Ukraine, ostensibly to protect its independence from the Bolsheviks in exchange for food supplies. The Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic (UPR) regained the power it had lost to the Bolshevik offensive but quickly found that German support came with strings attached. German authorities decided that Ukraine was unviable without their presence, ousting the UPR leadership and installing Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. For a brief period, this uneasy arrangement held. But when Germany lost World War I, its need for Ukraine disappeared. The retreating German forces left Ukraine vulnerable, and resistance to the unpopular hetman grew, while Moscow regained strength. In 1919, Symon Petliura and his forces overthrew Skoropadskyi, only to find themselves facing a resurgent Bolshevik threat. Seeking allies, Petliura ceded Ukraine&#x2019;s western territories to Poland but ultimately lost the battle to Moscow. The Ukrainian state disappeared. Then came the Holodomor, the Executed Renaissance, the destruction of Kyiv, and Russification. And now, history repeats itself &#x2014; only this time, it&#x2019;s the United States instead of Germany. Lithium instead of grain. Graphite instead of lard. The intention to hold elections in Ukraine instead of a coup. But unlike a century ago, there is no promise to send an army &#x2014; neither the U.S. nor NATO &#x2014; to protect the resources Washington needs. World politics is ruthless. You shouldn&apos;t expect mercy without internal unity and leverage to protect your interests. And when nearly the same scenario unfolds a hundred years later, it&#x2019;s time to think. A worker surveys iron ore mining operations at an iron ore mine in Poltava, Ukraine, on May 5, 2017. (Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)What mistakes must we avoid now to prevent repeating the failures of the past? Some takeaways: Politicians should not be at odds with each other. The egos and resentments of politicians, the desire to destroy their rivals in order to strengthen themselves, harm both the state and the people. Only Moscow benefits from internal divisions. The government should focus on strengthening the country&#x2019;s internal unity. Our allies, regardless of their identity, will inevitably prioritize their own interests over ours. The range of our options is narrowing, and the government must speak frankly about this with the public. We are all in the same boat. Society must value its state and understand that even if a ceasefire is reached, it will not end the war. Russia knows its goal and will eventually return for all of Ukraine. If the people turn away from their state, Moscow will destroy the state first, then the people.

1 killed, 20 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least one civilian and injured 20 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 10. Overnight, Russia launched 140 Shahed-type combat and decoy drones, the Ukrainian Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 85 drones across 10 oblasts, while 52 others were lost without causing damage. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed, and 10 others were injured as Russian troops hit residential areas and social infrastructure, damaging two high-rise buildings and 12 private houses, according to governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Donetsk Oblast, four residents were wounded in attacks on Katerynivka, Komar, and Nikiforivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces attacked 13 communities, injuring five people and damaging residential buildings, a school, and farm structures, local military administration reported. In Odesa Oblast, shrapnel from a Russian drone strike hit a car, injuring a woman who was hospitalized in moderate condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the attacks resulted in 20 reports of damage to apartments and private houses, but no casualties, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian attack damaged 10 private houses, two outbuildings, power lines, and a gas pipeline, but no casualties were reported, Governor Serhii Lysak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-20-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-13T03:35:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-13_08-28-32-2.jpg
Europe fears bearing Ukraine's post-war costs amid exclusion from US-Russia talks, FT reports	European nations fear they will be left to shoulder the costs of post-war security and reconstruction in Ukraine as they remain excluded from U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 13, citing senior European officials. European officials expect U.S. President Donald Trump to demand that Europe finance Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and deploy troops for peacekeeping without U.S. involvement, according to the report. The Telegraph previously reported that one of Trump&#x2019;s proposed peace plans includes calling on British and other European forces to enforce a buffer zone along the front line. Trump held separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12, later announcing that negotiations would begin &#x201C;immediately&#x201D; and that a ceasefire was in the &#x201C;not too distant future.&#x201D; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that Ukraine reclaiming its 2014 borders is unlikely and that NATO membership for Kyiv is off the table, a stance that has drawn strong reactions from European leaders. Former European Council President Donald Tusk called for a &quot;just peace,&quot; emphasizing that Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. must work together. Estonian politician Marko Mihkelson warned that &quot;today might go down in history as a dark day for Europe,&quot; urging leaders to act swiftly. &#xA0; Bloomberg Economics estimates that securing Ukraine and expanding European militaries could cost major EU powers an additional $3.1 trillion over the next decade. Security officials warn that failure to deter Russia could embolden Moscow to escalate its efforts to weaken or even break up the EU and NATO. &#xA0; &quot;President after president knew that transatlantic security benefited both the U.S. and Europe,&quot; former U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Bloomberg. &quot;It seems Trump thinks he knows better. History shall be the judge of this decision.&quot; &#xA0; European officials were reportedly caught off guard by Trump&apos;s direct engagement with Putin, with key allies receiving no prior notice, Bloomberg claims. The Kremlin confirmed it has begun forming a delegation for negotiations with the U.S., following Putin and Trump&apos;s agreement to prepare for a face-to-face meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-fears-bearing-ukraines-post-war-costs-amid-exclusion-from-us-russia-talks-ft-reports/	2025-02-13T03:28:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Zelensky approves sanctions against ex-President Poroshenko, oligarchs, businessmen	President Volodymyr Zelensky approved a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) decision on Feb. 13 to impose indefinite sanctions on several high-profile politicians, oligarchs, and businessmen. Sanctions were imposed against oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, billionaire Konstantin Zhevago, former PrivatBank co-owner Hennadiy Boholyubov, Ukraine&apos;s 5th President Petro Poroshenko, and Viktor Medvedchuk, a former pro-Russian lawmaker accused of state treason. The sanctions freeze all assets held by the targeted individuals in Ukraine and block them from conducting financial transactions, among other restrictions. The decree states the measures are indefinite. Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine&apos;s most infamous business tycoons, faces fraud and money laundering allegations, including accusations of withdrawing Hr 15 billion ($360 million) from Ukraine&apos;s largest bank, PrivatBank, before its nationalization in 2016. Boholyubov, a former co-owner of PrivatBank, is under investigation for allegedly fleeing Ukraine with forged documents in June 2024. &#xA0; Zhevago, a billionaire and former lawmaker, is suspected of embezzlement related to the collapse of Finance and Credit Bank in 2015. He was detained in France in December 2022 at Kyiv&apos;s request. Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian politician and close ally of Vladimir Putin, was charged with treason in 2021. He escaped house arrest days after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion but was later captured and exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners of war in September 2022. He is now in Russia. Poroshenko, Ukraine&apos;s fifth president (2014-2019) and current lawmaker from the European Solidarity party, has faced multiple criminal investigations. While cases against him were suspended after the full-scale invasion, his shares in 19 companies were seized, and affiliated businesses faced multimillion-dollar fines. &quot;The National Security and Defense Council has just made an unconstitutional, politically motivated decision to impose sanctions against me, Petro Poroshenko, the leader of the opposition and the fifth president (of Ukraine),&quot; Poroshenko said in a statement. &quot;Today, Zelensky has dealt a huge blow to the internal unity that our team has been strictly adhering to since February 2022 and which is our main weapon in the fight against the aggressor,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-imposes-sanctions-against-ex-president-oligarchs-businessmen/	2025-02-13T02:24:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Russia preparing delegation for US talks on war with Ukraine, Kremlin says	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia has started forming a group for talks with the United States, including on the war with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media on Feb. 13. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during telephone talks to instruct aides to prepare for a face-to-face meeting immediately. Peskov said Moscow and Washington have yet to work out the meeting details. &quot;The work will be started quickly. It will be necessary to wait for the developments, and it will already be possible to say what place and terms,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-prepares-negotiation-group-for-talks-with-us-on-war-against-ukraine-kremlin-says/	2025-02-13T02:13:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Russia's largest steel mill reportedly targeted by 'massive' Ukrainian drone strike	Russia&apos;s Lipetsk Oblast came under a &quot;massive raid&quot; by drones on the night of Feb. 13, regional governor Igor Artamonov said. The drones allegedly targeted the Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK), Russia&apos;s largest steel mill, which produces about 20% of the country&apos;s steel output, according to pro-Kremlin media outlet Shot. The facility, located around 400 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border, accounts for 80% of NLMK&apos;s steel production and is a key asset of Russian billionaire Vladimir Lisin, the third richest Russian on Forbes&apos; 2023 list. Following the overnight attack, power outages were reported in several districts of Lipetsk. &quot;At the moment, power engineers are reconnecting consumers,&quot; Artamonov wrote on Telegram. Debris from one of the downed drones reportedly fell on the Lipetsk aeration station, injuring an employee who was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed air defense intercepted and destroyed 83 drones overnight, including 37 over Bryansk Oblast, 12 each over Kursk and Lipetsk Oblasts, nine over Tver, and three each over Belgorod, Kaluga, Smolensk, and Voronezh Oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The incident follows a Feb. 3 strike, when Ukrainian drones targeted an oil refinery in Volgograd and a gas processing plant in Astrakhan, Russia, overnight, according to a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) speaking to the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-lipetsk-oblast-hit-by-massive-drone-raid-largest-steel-mill-reportedly-targeted/	2025-02-13T01:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1216644236.jpg
We cannot defend ourselves' — Russian drones crash, explode in Moldova during attack on Ukraine	Several Russian drones launched in a mass overnight attack on Ukraine on Feb. 13 flew into Moldovan airspace with at least one exploding, and one crashing on the country&apos;s territory, Moldovan media outlet NewsMaker reported. &quot;Russian drones and bombs are falling and exploding in our villages. And we must recognize that we cannot defend ourselves against them,&quot; Moldovan President Maia Sandu said. One drone crashed into a field near the village of Chumai in Taraclia district, while another exploded between the town of Ceadir-Lunga and the village of Valea Perjei. According to Moldova&apos;s Police General Inspectorate, fragments found in Ceadir-Lunga confirmed that the drone was of Russian origin. The border police reported no injuries, and authorities have isolated the area for further investigation. &quot;Experts from the technical and explosive division of the police are at both locations and are conducting an investigation. The drones will be studied in more detail in the future,&quot; the statement said. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian drones have repeatedly crashed on Moldovan territory, and missiles have violated its airspace, prompting strong condemnation from Chisinau. On Jan. 17, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed the discovery of Russian drone fragments in two communities along the Romania-Ukraine border.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drones-crash-explode-in-moldova-during-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-02-13T01:10:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/477294535_1198923984935722_5644506664633572859_n-2.jpg

China proposes to host Trump-Putin talks without Ukraine's Zelensky, WSJ reports	Chinese officials have proposed arranging a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but the idea has been met with skepticism, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Feb. 13, citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the publication, Beijing made the offer through intermediaries, suggesting a U.S.-Russia summit without Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s participation. The White House declined to confirm whether it had received China&apos;s proposal but dismissed it as &quot;not viable at all,&quot; according to a U.S. official quoted by WSJ. Trump announced on Feb. 12 that he had spoken with Putin and that their first in-person meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The extent of Ukrainian involvement in these talks remains unclear. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has long positioned itself as a potential mediator in the conflict, dispatching envoy Li Hui on diplomatic missions in Europe while criticizing Western military aid to Ukraine. Western officials remain wary of Beijing&apos;s deepening ties with Moscow, with NATO labeling China a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war. Despite its diplomatic efforts, Beijing is cautious about taking any steps that could jeopardize its close relationship with the Kremlin, according to a WSJ source.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-offers-to-host-trump-putin-talks-without-zelensky-wsj-reports/	2025-02-12T23:38:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1000100420.jpg
Trump has the economic tools to end Russia’s war. He should use them	There are still many questions about what to expect from the Trump administration&#x2019;s approach to ending Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. With some in Congress questioning continued military aid and loans for Ukraine, the application of economic statecraft measures &#x2014;such as sanctions, export controls, and tariffs &#x2014; could be used more aggressively to push for Russia&apos;s withdrawal. Sanctions were a key tool in the first Trump administration&#x2019;s foreign policy strategy. However, we&apos;ve heard little about how a second-term Trump administration plans to leverage them. Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that new tariffs and sanctions would be imposed on Moscow if it didn&#x2019;t reach a deal to stop the war. With so many rounds of sanctions already imposed by the United States and its broad multilateral coalition, what options remain? Two key levers could help achieve the ultimate goal of this pressure campaign: further disrupting Russia&#x2019;s energy trade and tightening restrictions on dual-use goods flowing to Russia through third countries that support its military. First, a more aggressive use of secondary sanctions could prove effective. Secondary sanctions, which force countries to choose between doing business with the U.S. or with sanctioned entities, were instrumental in bringing Iran to the negotiating table for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Secondary sanctions on Russia, imposed by then-U.S. President Joe Biden in December 2023, have begun to take effect. It is conceivable that a second Trump administration could use this tool to pressure unaligned countries &#x2014; including some current U.S. allies &#x2014; to align with American objectives. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) holds a vicdeo call with Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) at his residence outside Moscow, Russia, on Jan. 21, 2025. (Gavriil Grigorov / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)More aggressive threats of cutting off access to the U.S. economy for entities in countries such as India, China, Turkey, and Middle Eastern nations &#x2014; where businesses continue trading with Russia while maintaining ties with the U.S. and its allies &#x2014; could be considered. Even amid debates over continued aid to Ukraine, increasing pressure on these nations to stop their companies from purchasing Russian energy products or facilitating the flow of dual-use items to Russia could be an effective strategy with limited cost to American taxpayers. Second, lessons from previous sanctions campaigns show that aggressive enforcement serves as an additional stick to influence corporate decision-making. At one point, fines for sanctions violations reached upward of $9 billion. While enforcement should not be politicized, prioritizing cases against well-known violators of Russia sanctions could have a strong deterrent effect on those skirting the rules. Some have suggested easing certain sanctions to incentivize Russia to negotiate. However, this approach would likely be ineffective in changing the trajectory of the war, as Putin responds only to force. Trump has made no secret of his willingness to use the U.S. economic statecraft toolkit to achieve policy objectives. Ending the war is a bipartisan priority, but more importantly, Russia must not be allowed to win &#x2014; otherwise, other countries could face a similar fate. When it comes to Russia, Trump should leverage the considerable economic power at his disposal to remind those doing business with both Russia and the U.S. that access to American markets is a privilege, not a right. Given the choice between access to the U.S. economy and trade with Russia, many countries would quickly opt for the former. A firm stance on economic pressure could accelerate an end to the conflict and reinforce American leadership on the world stage.

US special envoy Kellogg to visit Kyiv as part of European tour, State Department confirms	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, will visit Ukraine as part of a European tour, the U.S. State Department announced on Feb. 12. Kellogg will travel to Germany, Belgium, and Ukraine from Feb. 13 to 22 to &quot;advance President Trump&apos;s goal of securing peace through strength in Ukraine and upholding the national security interests of the United States,&quot; the statement said. While in Ukraine, he is expected to meet with officials and civilians affected by nearly three years of war. Kellogg will also attend the Munich Security Conference. His visit comes as the U.S. president intensifies efforts to negotiate a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. On Feb. 12, Trump spoke by phone with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that leaders &quot;want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky and Trump agreed to begin working toward ending the war, according to Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office. Trump said he had instructed a team including State Secretary Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to lead the negotiations, omitting Kellogg. Trump further announced that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with Zelensky in Munich on Feb. 14 to begin official negotiations. Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation to the Munich Security Conference, where Trump&apos;s team is expected to outline its diplomatic approach.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-special-envoy-kellogg-to-visit-kyiv-as-part-of-european-tour/	2025-02-12T22:50:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193307307.jpg

Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast injure 5	Russia attacked 13 communities in Sumy Oblast on Feb. 12, injuring five people, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. The communities of Sumy, Bezdryk, Verkhnya Syrovatka, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Bilopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Krolevets, Esman, Druzhba, Seredyna-Buda, and Svesy were targeted. In total, Russian forces fired 104 times and caused 186 explosions. The shelling damaged residential buildings, a school, and farm structures. Among the hardest-hit areas was the Yunakivka community, where FPV drones injured three people and destroyed a civilian vehicle. The Esman community faced a barrage of artillery, mortar fire, and multiple rocket launcher systems, with UAV-dropped rockets injuring a civilian. In Verkhnya Syrovatka, a drone strike left one person injured and caused destruction to six homes and an educational institution. The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located about 3 kilometers west of the Ukraine-Russia border, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 86 explosions recorded in the area. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts.

Putin holds first call with Syria's transitional president, pledges support and future cooperation	Russian President Vladimir Putin held his first official phone conversation on Feb. 12 with Syria&#x2019;s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, following the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad. The Kremlin described the discussion as &#x201C;constructive and business-like,&#x201D; covering trade, education, and other areas of cooperation, with both leaders agreeing to maintain dialogue. Syrian television reported that al-Shaara reaffirmed Syria&#x2019;s strategic ties with Russia and expressed willingness to engage with all parties that could contribute to security and stability. Putin allegedly offered to help with the country&apos;s economic situation and invited Syria&#x2019;s foreign minister to visit Moscow. The call came after a Russian delegation visited Damascus, marking the first such trip since Assad was ousted and granted asylum in Russia. Following the overthrow of Assad in December, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra stated on Feb. 6 that Russia&apos;s ability to retain its naval base in Tartus and airbase in Khmeimim will depend on what Moscow offers in return. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to support Assad&apos;s brutal crackdown against opposition forces. With Moscow&apos;s backing, Assad&apos;s regime imprisoned, tortured, and killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-holds-first-call-with-syrias-transitional-president-pledges-support-and-future-cooperation/	2025-02-12T19:35:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000495.jpg
Netherlands to supply Ukraine with 25 YPR armored medical evacuation vehicles	The Netherlands will soon send Ukraine 25 YPR armored vehicles, the Dutch Defense Ministry reported after the Ramstein-format meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12.

Oil prices drop 2% as Trump takes first step toward Ukraine peace talks, Reuters reports	Oil prices dropped more than 2% on Feb. 12 after U.S. President Donald Trump took a significant step toward ending the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has contributed to higher oil prices due to concerns over global supply disruptions. By 1:38 p.m. EST, Brent futures were down $1.71, or 2.22%, at $75.29 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped $1.78, or 2.43%, to $71.54. At their session lows, both benchmarks had fallen by more than $1 per barrel. The declines followed three days of gains, with Brent rising 3.6% and WTI increasing 3.7%, according to Reuters. Trump addressed the war in Ukraine during phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&apos;s leader Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;Trump doing peace talks, I think that has taken some of the risk premium out of oil prices right now,&quot; Phil Flynn, a senior analyst with Price Futures Group, told Reuters. Trump later confirmed on his social media platform that he and Putin had &quot;agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelensky, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.&quot; Zelensky&#x2019;s office said that the two leaders spoke for about an hour. Following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Feb. 11 and new data showing that U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January, investors are trying to assess the central bank&#x2019;s next move regarding interest rate cuts, Reuters reported. &quot;The combination of higher inflation and the possibility of peace (in Ukraine) is causing a bit of a sell-off in the market at the moment,&quot; Flynn told the news agency.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-prices-drop-2-as-trump-takes-first-step-toward-ukraine-peace-talks-reuters-reports/	2025-02-12T17:05:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1229692952.jpeg
Surrender & betrayal' — US, EU officials condemn Trump, Hegseth's comments on Ukraine peace negotiations	U.S. President Donald Trump held phone calls with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky, announcing on Feb. 12 that negotiations to end the war would begin &quot;immediately&quot; and a ceasefire in Ukraine is in the &quot;not too distant future.&quot; &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote. Earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth added that it is unrealistic to expect Ukraine to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow and that NATO membership for Ukraine is off the table. Both Hegseth&apos;s and Trump&apos;s remarks quickly drew sharp criticism from various political figures. Senator Richard Blumenthal condemned Hegseth&#x2019;s message, calling it a &quot;surrender &amp; betrayal&quot; of Ukraine. Blumenthal, who has made six visits to Ukraine during its fight against Russia, argued that the message amounted to abandoning Ukraine and undermining the security of European allies. He emphasized the unquenchable courage of Ukrainians, adding, &quot;They will persevere.&quot; Rep. Don Bacon shared similar concerns, urging the U.S. to recognize who started the war and who was responsible for the indiscriminate bombing of cities. &quot;We should have moral clarity who started this war, who is bombing cities indiscriminately and who our real friend here is,&quot; Bacon said, emphasizing the consequences of rewarding the invader. Adam Schiff, in a pointed critique, wrote: &quot;Today, President Trump called our enemy, Russia, before calling our ally, Ukraine. Meanwhile, his Secretary of Defense ruled out a future for Ukraine in NATO and a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over its own lands.&quot; He called this a &#x201C;surrender of Ukraine&#x2019;s interests&#x201D; and accused Trump of being a &quot;great dealmaker&quot; for the Kremlin. European leaders followed with strong opinions. Former European Council President Donald Tusk wrote, &#x201C;All we need is peace. A JUST PEACE. Ukraine, Europe, and the United States should work on this together. TOGETHER.&#x201D; Estonian politician Marko Mihkelson expressed his concern, saying, &quot;Today might go down in history as a dark day for Europe,&quot; urging European leaders to recognize the importance of taking action now. Meanwhile, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, declaring, &quot;Ukraine&apos;s independence and territorial integrity are unconditional.&quot; She stressed the need for Europe to play a central role in strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees in any negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/surrender-betrayal-us-eu-officials-condemn-trump-hegseths-comments-on-ukraine-russia-war/	2025-02-12T15:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196223254.jpg
Russia's military spending surpasses Europe's as Putin ramps up war budget, study finds	Russia&#x2019;s military spending, driven by President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s efforts to put the country&#x2019;s economy on a war footing, has now surpassed the combined defense budgets of all European nations, according to a new study. In 2024, Russia&#x2019;s total defense expenditures surged by 42% in real terms, reaching 13.1 trillion rubles. When adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)&#x2014;which accounts for differences in what money can buy in different countries&#x2014;this amounts to $462 billion, according to the data by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the Financial Times reported. By comparison, total defense spending across Europe, including the U.K. and EU member states, increased by nearly 12% last year to $457 billion, slightly trailing Moscow&#x2019;s budget. The IISS&#x2019;s annual &quot;Military Balance&quot; report, which assesses global military capabilities and defense spending, highlights key security concerns for Europe&#x2014;especially in light of the potential for reduced U.S. support for Ukraine and European defense. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pledged to bring Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine to a swift conclusion, has stated that his administration engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with Moscow. He has also criticized the amount the US spends on the war and European security overall. One of Trump&#x2019;s main talking points has been Europe&#x2019;s financial contribution to its own defense, including aid to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, total U.S. assistance to Ukraine amounts to approximately 88 billion euros &#x2014;about a third less than Europe&#x2019;s total of 125 billion. Trump has pushed for Europe to dedicate 5% of its GDP to defense, significantly higher than the current average of roughly 1.7 percent. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has called for a target of 3%. Either figure would see European defense spending surpass Russia&#x2019;s by a significant margin. The IISS projects that in 2025, Russia&#x2019;s total defense expenditures&#x2014;including &quot;voluntary&quot; contributions from regional governments and businesses&#x2014;will grow by another 13.7 percent, reaching 15.6 trillion rubles. That would amount to 7.5% of GDP and nearly 40% of federal spending. While this heavy military investment is straining Russia&#x2019;s economy, IISS noted that &quot;Russia can still bear the costs of war.&quot; IISS added that if European defense spending were to rise to 3% of GDP, it would add an estimated $250 billion to current levels. At 5% of GDP, spending would increase by roughly $800 billion&#x2014;almost double Russia&#x2019;s current military expenditures. However, IISS also pointed out that European military budgets have already grown by 50% since 2014, and &quot;fiscal constraints may dampen [further] growth.&quot; For example, Germany&#x2019;s defense budget climbed 23% last year to $86 billion, surpassing the U.K.&#x2019;s $81 billion for the first time in over 30 years. Germany&#x2019;s increased defense spending was largely due to one-time disbursements from a special military fund, and IISS warned that maintaining that level of funding remains uncertain. The country&#x2019;s commitment to allocating 2% of GDP to defense by 2029&#x2014;up from 1.8% currently&#x2014;is also uncertain, according to the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-military-spending-surpasses-europes-as-putin-ramps-up-war-budget-study-finds/	2025-02-12T14:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/cut_GettyImages-2151579331.jpg
Trump announces first meeting with Putin to take place in Saudi Arabia	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 12 that his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will take place in Saudi Arabia as part of efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;ll meet in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House, according to AFP. His statement came just hours after he revealed that the two leaders had spoken by telephone and agreed to immediately begin peace talks regarding Ukraine. The announcement marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow. The decision to hold negotiations without Ukraine&apos;s direct involvement has raised concerns about Kyiv&#x2019;s role in shaping its own future. The extent of Ukrainian participation in the talks remains unclear. Trump&#x2019;s approach signals a renewed push to broker a resolution to the ongoing war, however, neither the Kremlin nor the White House has provided further details on the timing or agenda of the meeting. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that both he and Vladimir Putin agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes, during which Putin extended an invitation for Trump to visit Moscow. Trump also announced that he had instructed a team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to lead the negotiations. According to Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 14 to begin official peace negotiations. &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote on Truth Social.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-first-meeting-with-putin-to-take-place-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-02-12T13:09:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trumps holds talks with Zelensky and Putin, says negotiations to end war in Ukraine to start 'immediately'	Key developments on. Feb. 12: U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. &quot;Just spoke with Donald Trump. Long conversation. About the possibilities of achieving peace. About our willingness to work together. About our technological capabilities, including drones and other modern manufacturing,&quot; Zelensky said following the call. &quot;Ukraine wants peace more than anyone else. We are defining our joint steps with America to stop Russian aggression and guarantee a reliable, lasting peace,&quot; he added. Hours prior, Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; In a post on Truth Social, Trump said both agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes and Putin invited Trump to Moscow. Trump added that he had instructed a team including State Secretary Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to lead the negotiations. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio will meet Zelensky on Feb. 14 to begin official peace negotiations, Trump announced on Truth Social. &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;I am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. It is time to stop this ridiculous war, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, death and destruction,&quot; he added. &quot;God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that it is unrealistic to expect that Ukraine can restore its pre-2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. also wants to see Ukraine as &quot;sovereign and prosperous,&quot; but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&quot; &quot;Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,&quot; he added. Hegseth also said the U.S. does not believe that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. The Pentagon chief added that any security guarantees provided to Ukraine must also be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops.&quot; &quot;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier in the day to participate in the Ramstein-format meeting. As Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office, the U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has begun his work at the 26th Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12, the first event of its kind not chaired by the U.S. The meeting, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. &quot;The main goal is strengthening military cooperation and real mechanisms to support Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. The agenda includes ensuring a stable and timely supply of military aid in 2025, accelerating the delivery of critical weapons like air defense systems, aviation, and ammunition, and fostering joint projects with European partners. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. This marks the first Ramstein summit during U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has prompted concerns not only about the future of the UDCG but also about the overall allied support for Ukraine. While pledging to broker a swift peace deal, the U.S. president has been evasive regarding the continued military backing for Kyiv. &quot;This is an important stage in strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and coordinating further actions of the allies,&quot; Umerov added. The UDCG, comprising over 50 countries, including all NATO members, typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Ramstein summit coincides with other key events this week, including the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting and the Munich Security Conference. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that without Ukraine, Europe could face a full-scale Russian occupation due to Moscow&apos;s numerical advantage in forces, he said in a segment of an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 12. Zelensky highlighted the disparity in forces between Russia and Europe, saying that Ukraine&apos;s army consists of 110 brigades, while Russia fields 220 and plans to expand to 250 this year. In contrast, Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades, he said. &quot;Without Ukraine, Europe will be totally occupied by Russia, if they want. And I believe they (Russia) have nothing else on their mind,&quot; the president said in the interview. &quot;Today, an army of 110 brigades is holding back those who have 220-230. But it&apos;s one to two,&quot; Zelensky added. The president said that while Russia&apos;s numeral advantage compared to Ukraine is two to one, in comparison to Europe, it&apos;s three to one, which is sufficient for an effective offensive. Zelensky added that Russia intends to increase its forces by 12-15 divisions &#x2014; around 150,000 troops &#x2014; through mobilization, training, and the addition of North Korean soldiers. According to the president, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence also suggests that new Russian recruits will be trained in Belarus. &quot;After that, they can launch a full-scale invasion from there. But who said that it would be to Ukraine? Russia can invade Poland or Lithuania,&quot; Zelensky warned. The president said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Zelensky also disclosed in the interview that an assassination attempt on him at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 led to casualties inside the Presidential Office. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the head of the agency&apos;s counter-terrorism department, who is suspected of working for Russian intelligence, SBU head Vasyl Maliuk announced on Feb. 12. While the agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s name, the Kyiv Independent&apos;s SBU sources identified him as Colonel Dmytro Koziura. The suspect&apos;s illicit activities were documented in 14 separate cases, according to Maliuk. The SBU chief emphasized that the operation to uncover and detain him required &quot;all possible overt and covert methods.&quot; The case sheds light on Russian efforts to infiltrate and undermine Ukraine&apos;s security services amid the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. &quot;In the process, we managed to document the collection and transmission of relevant information to Russia,&quot; Maliuk added. The suspect was said to be working with Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB). &quot;Using encrypted software bookmarks, we penetrated the traitor&apos;s gadgets &#x2014; mobile terminals and computers. We basically lived with him and conducted audio and video monitoring,&quot; the SBU chief added. The SBU head described the operation as part of an ongoing internal purge and warned that no Russian infiltration attempts would succeed. Further details of the case are expected to be released soon. A Russian ballistic missile strike on Kyiv on Feb. 12 damaged the office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim, the news channels announced. The office sustained damage to windows and equipment, but the channels said they remain operational. The statements mentioned no casualties. According to a TSN journalist on the ground, everything within a 300-meter radius was damaged. Parts of the facades were demolished, and doors were blown off. &quot;For terrorists who violate any conventions and disregard international law, the media is a desirable target,&quot; the Freedom TV channel said in a statement. Russia has previously targeted Ukraine&apos;s media infrastructure, including a strike on Kharkiv&apos;s TV broadcasting tower in April 2024 and Kyiv&apos;s TV tower in March 2022. The morning attack on Kyiv struck an industrial zone housing multiple office centers. Footage from the scene shows shattered glass, structural damage to buildings, and wrecked cars. At least one person was killed and four injured in the city. Ukraine War Latest is put together by the Kyiv Independent news desk team, who keep you informed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Zelensky imposes sanctions against ex-President Poroshenko, former president says	Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) has imposed sanctions against ex-President Petro Poroshenko, the former president said in a statement. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that an official decree will be published on Feb. 13, without naming Poroshenko by name. Poroshenko did not specify what restrictions would be imposed on him in his video address, but the sanctions could be implemented based on alleged &quot;high treason,&quot; according to Forbes Ukraine, which cited two sources. &quot;The National Security and Defense Council has just made an unconstitutional, politically motivated decision to impose sanctions against me, Petro Poroshenko, the leader of the opposition and the fifth president (of Ukraine),&quot; Poroshenko said in a statement. &quot;Today, Zelensky has dealt a huge blow to the internal unity that our team has been strictly adhering to since February 2022 and which is our main weapon in the fight against the aggressor,&quot; he said. &quot;All responsibility for the negative consequences lies directly with him,&quot; Poroshenko added. In his evening address, Zelensky said he had participated in the Defense Council meeting and that its decisions would be published the following day.&quot;We are defending our country and restoring justice. Everyone who destroyed the national security of Ukraine and helped Russia must be held accountable (for their actions),&quot; Zelensky said without specifying who exactly could be penalized and what that would mean. Poroshenko served one term as Ukraine&apos;s president from 2014 until 2019. Volodymyr Zelensky dealt a decisive defeat to Poroshenko in the 2019 election, securing 73.22% of the vote against his opponent&apos;s 24.45% in the second round. Following Zelensky&apos;s victory, over 20 criminal cases were opened against Poroshenko. He was charged with treason, his shares in 19 companies were seized, and his affiliated companies received multimillion-dollar fines from the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine, according to Forbes Ukraine. After the start of the full-scale invasion, the investigation of criminal cases against the former president was suspended.	https://kyivindependent.com/forbes-ukraine-ukraines-national-security-and-defense-council-imposes-sanctions-against-ex-president-poroshenko/	2025-02-12T12:38:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258284805.jpg
We asked young Ukrainians what would make them sign up for the armed forces	Ukraine faces a delicate balancing act &#x2014; mobilizing enough people to fend off the immediate threat posed by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, and preserving enough of the country&apos;s youth to weather longer-term demographic concerns. On top of this, U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are reportedly urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address the manpower shortages, a move that President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently resisted. The introduction of &quot;special contracts&quot; for those aged 18-24 appears to be an attempt by Kyiv to bridge the gap with a compromise solution &#x2014; entice young people to sign up voluntarily, boosting the armed forces&apos; manpower, while avoiding expanding forced mobilization. The new one-year contracts will include a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, and free higher education, it was reported on Feb. 10. A day later, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said those who complete one year of service would be allowed to travel abroad. Currently, with a few exemptions, all men aged 18-60 are prohibited from travelling overseas while martial law is in place. &quot;We are building a new army recruitment system that meets modern challenges,&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a post on Facebook on Feb. 11 when announcing the special contracts. &quot;We are bringing in motivated warriors, providing them with career growth opportunities, and ensuring fair service conditions.&quot; But according to several young men aged 17-24 in Kyiv who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the enticements may be attractive, but concerns remain. &quot;I support this because it is very important to attract young people to the armed forces,&quot; 19-year-old Vadym Chaplyhin, a student at the Kyiv School of Economics tells the Kyiv Independent. A military officer from the third separate assault brigade does recruitment work in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 15, 2024. (Ashley Chan / SOPA Images / Getty Images)He said the proposed benefits &quot;look pretty good&quot; and the opportunity to go abroad after one year of service &quot;will significantly influence the decision of many boys.&quot; &quot;(It is) a chance to see family and friends and travel the world a bit,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;That is why I like this point very much, and if we consider my doubts about mobilization, this possibility significantly tips the scales in its direction.&quot; But Chaplyhin has reservations about how a contract soldier might be viewed by those who were conscripted. &quot;How will other soldiers treat such mobilized people? After all, they may be perceived as those who have &apos;sold out&apos; and will fight not for ideals, but for money,&quot; he says. Oleksandr Slysh, a 24-year-old master&apos;s degree graduate, expressed deep skepticism that some of the benefits would be honored. After his previous experience working as an assistant military lawyer for six months, he believes offers like the right to travel abroad would only be implemented for &quot;high-ranking officials or their children,&quot; but not for &quot;ordinary soldiers.&quot; Slysh also suggests that no amount of money, free education or any other benefits can compensate for what he might experience if he ends up fighting on the front lines. &quot;Infantry is the hardest job in the armed forces, and most infantrymen are very psychologically traumatized if they survive,&quot; he says. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight, so the prospect of knowing the contract ends after one year is seen as a big plus by 23-year-old accountant Andrii. He and several other people interviewed for this story didn&#x2019;t wish to be fully identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. &quot;I like all the conditions, but the most important thing is that the contract be fulfilled in one year,&quot; he tells the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As they say, one year is enough.&quot; Cadets sing the national anthem of Ukraine during the celebration of the Day of Knowledge at the Lviv State Lyceum in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sept. 1, 2023. (Pavlo Palamarchuk / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)But an 18-year-old studying to be a chef who didn&apos;t wish to be named, says he doesn&apos;t trust the authorities when they say the contract will actually end after one year. &quot;They could say &apos;sign this contract, you will serve for a year.&apos; Then they will make some kind of law that says those who have signed a contract and served for a year are eligible for general mobilization, even if they&apos;re under 25,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m worried about what might happen after the contract is up.&quot; Yevhen, a 24-year old &#xA0;computer science student at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, suggests the special contracts only provide an incentive for less well-off Ukrainians. &quot;I think that it will be relevant for children from low-income families or villages, but in Kyiv I&apos;m not sure how relevant it is,&quot; he says. &quot;Most students in Kyiv live with their parents and have free tuition, and an apartment at this age.&quot; Dmytro, a 24-year-old economics student, echoed this sentiment, saying the decision to sign a special contract &quot;depends very much on whether you have a job.&quot; &quot;If you&apos;re in some kind of civil service role or a good company or you&apos;re sitting in a ministry getting paid, you have much less time to be killed, and you don&apos;t need it,&quot; he says. But for some, no number of enticements will be enough to make them sign up. &quot;My life is more important to me. And since I have no relatives here, nothing motivates me here at all,&quot; Bohdan, a 23-year-old tattoo artist says. Yaroslav, a 17-year-old student, is thinking about his future career, but thinks the army is &quot;not my thing.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d rather be in the civilian world. I&apos;m more interested in something like law or philosophy.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-asked-young-ukrainians-what-would-make-them-sign-up-for-the-armed-forces/	2025-02-12T11:58:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1255487880.jpg
Trump says peace talks to start 'immediately.' But what terms would be acceptable for Ukraine?	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 12 held phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation,&quot; Trump wrote. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on the same day that it is unrealistic to expect Ukraine to restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending the war. He also said that NATO membership for Ukraine is off the table. Following the most recent comments by U.S. top officials, Kyiv would most likely be pressured by Washington to make concessions to Russia. Ukraine will likely refuse to recognize any of the occupied territories as Russian de jure, reduce its army, legalize any openly pro-Russian political project, or officially abandon aspirations to join NATO, experts say. Other clauses may be more palatable for Kyiv. These include a delay in NATO membership, freezing the current front line, holding elections, or exchanging Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk Oblast for some part of Russian-occupied Ukraine. There may also be some compromise on &#x201C;pro-peace parties&#x201D; that do not openly back Russia, the status of the Russian language, and the Russian-backed Orthodox church in case it breaks ties with Russia, according to experts. Yet, for Ukraine, it all comes down to making sure that Russia won&apos;t renew its invasion as soon as it sees an opportunity. &quot;The main question is how to deter Putin if he &#x2014; should a truce agreement be reached, which I doubt &#x2014; tries once again to seize a larger part of Ukraine&apos;s territory,&quot; said Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee. &quot;What could realistically stop him? In my opinion, only NATO membership,&quot; he added. Zelensky and several top U.S. officials, including Trump&apos;s Ukraine and Russia envoy Keith Kellogg and Vice President JD Vance, will attend the Munich Security Conference scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Zelensky is expected to meet both of them, according to the President&apos;s Office. Kellogg is also expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, while Trump said he is expected to meet with Zelensky soon, without providing the exact place and time of the proposed meeting. The potential peace negotiations would be the number one topic on the list. Yet, regardless of what the U.S. officials could ask, there are a number of red lines that Ukraine would not cross. Experts agree that Ukraine will likely not recognize any of the Russian-occupied territories as Russian de jure, while Russia will not cancel the illegal annexation of any of the territories that it claims in Ukraine. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea peninsula in 2014, as well as the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Despite this, Russia only partially controls the latter four regions it said it owns. &quot;There are two fundamental things that must not be compromised,&quot; Volodymyr Aryev, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party, told the Kyiv Independent. President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Viktor Kovalchuk / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)&quot;First, recognizing the aggressor&apos;s claim over the occupied territories is unacceptable. Second, we cannot accept limitations on our army, restrictions on the number of weapons, or any self-imposed constraints on forming military alliances. These two red lines must be set in stone. As for everything else, I think there is room to maneuver to some extent.&quot; A freezing of the front line or an exchange of occupied territories without any change in their legal status is possible, according to experts. &quot;I think there will be a ceasefire along the line of contact at the time,&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There may be some adjustments and possibly a buffer zone. But I cannot see any major territorial changes or any formal recognition of the status quo.&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that Ukraine could exchange its foothold in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast for the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Independent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin agreed, saying that &quot;the Kursk factor is very important here&quot; and that &quot;exiting the war with part of his territory occupied by Ukrainian forces would be humiliating for Putin.&quot; Zelensky has said he&apos;s open to an exchange. The Telegraph reported in November that, under one of the peace plans being considered by Trump, he might call on European peacekeepers to enforce a buffer zone in Ukraine. Experts say this is theoretically possible, but the proposal would face difficulties, and Russia will likely resist. &quot;To carry out military functions, there would have to be tens of thousands of personnel,&quot; Oreshkin said. &quot;The West is unlikely to be enthusiastic about this idea because it would be an extremely expensive undertaking.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that &quot;whether this is feasible or not will probably depend on the precise set of circumstances and restrictions in force.&quot; French soldiers of the NATO combat unit in Estonia stand in front of a combat vehicle in a military hangar in Tapa, Estonia, on Dec. 17, 2024. (Alexander Welscher / Picture alliance via Getty Images)&quot;Putting peacekeeping forces in an area where military operations are still happening or at great risk of taking place would be asking for trouble,&quot; she added. &quot;European governments are likely to be justifiably cautious.&quot; The deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine is possible but definitely not the 200,000 number mentioned by Zelensky in January, Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. In his most recent interview, Zelensky said that European activity on the ground must be backed by the U.S. &quot;There are voices which say that Europe could offer security guarantees without the Americans, and I always say no,&quot; Zelensky told the Guardian. &quot;Security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees.&quot; According to Kellogg&apos;s earlier proposals, the sanctions imposed on Russia would be partially lifted. But the crucial question for Ukraine is whether the lifting of the sanctions will be dependent on Russia&apos;s compliance with a potential ceasefire or peace deal. Wolff said that &quot;if there is a ceasefire, some gradual reduction of sanctions is likely.&quot; &quot;Unless sanction-lifting was done as part of a step-by-step process dependent on Russia taking meaningful steps to undo and make amends for the damage it has done to Ukraine and Ukrainians, Putin would simply pocket it as a win and carry on to do as he wished,&quot; Mathers said. According to a peace plan co-authored by Kellogg in early 2024, Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession would be taken off the table for an extended period. Ukraine has sought to join the alliance since the early 2000s and officially applied for NATO membership in 2022. Ukraine&apos;s intention to join the alliance is included in its constitution. However, the bloc has been reluctant to admit Ukraine. Since NATO is not currently agreeing to Ukraine&apos;s accession anyway, a clause on a delay in NATO membership would not change much, experts say. &quot;NATO has already effectively delayed the question of Ukraine&apos;s membership until some indefinite point in the future,&quot; Mathers said.

(Al Drago / Bloomberg / Getty Images)Aryev said that a decision on whether to delay NATO membership is up to the alliance, not Ukraine, and Kyiv cannot &quot;force its way in.&quot; However, Russia has demanded not just delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession but requiring Kyiv to officially abandon the goal of NATO membership and become a neutral state. Experts and lawmakers say that Ukraine is highly unlikely to accept this demand. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership is a strategic goal, and Ukraine must stand its ground on this matter at all costs,&quot; Aryev said. Merezhko agreed, saying that &quot;under no circumstances should Ukraine abandon its goal of joining NATO, as it is the best guarantee of our security and survival.&quot; Since NATO accession is unlikely in the near future, a lot depends on whether the West will provide any tangible security guarantees for Ukraine. Kellogg&apos;s plan envisages security guarantees for Ukraine but does not elaborate on them. &quot;There could be a security agreement with the U.S.,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;It should be ratified by the U.S. Congress so that it becomes a full-fledged treaty &#x2014; at least something similar to the agreements that (the U.S. had with) Israel and Egypt.&quot; Aryev said that a genuine security guarantee would be a bilateral treaty similar to the &quot;Taiwan Relations Act, which is part of U.S. legislation and obliges the United States to provide military assistance to Taiwan in the event of aggression.&quot; Despite that, even a bilateral defense pact with the U.S. doesn&apos;t guarantee that Ukraine would receive anything more than military aid. JD Vance made it clear, saying on Feb. 11 that the U.S. would not be sending troops to Ukraine and that the heavy lifting should instead be done by Europeans. Instead, Zelensky has said that Kyiv does not see any security agreements as having real weight unless they include U.S. backing.

(Telmo Pinto / SOPA Images / Getty Images)According to Kellogg&apos;s proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg&apos;s proposals stipulate that the U.S. would cease military aid to Ukraine if it does not agree to hold peace negotiations. On the other hand, the U.S. would increase its military support for Ukraine if Russia refuses to accept a peace deal. &quot;(Military aid for Ukraine) depends on whether Putin overplays his hand and Trump gets more frustrated seeing Russia as the main obstacle to a deal,&quot; Wolff said. Kellogg told Reuters in a Feb. 1 interview that the U.S. wants Ukraine to hold elections, potentially by the end of the year, especially if Kyiv can agree to a truce with Russia in the coming months. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned. Elections can only be held after martial law is lifted. Experts say that elections are a realistic scenario if there is a ceasefire, and if martial law is canceled, but not before a ceasefire. Over 7 million Ukrainians have left Ukraine as a result of Russia&apos;s war and are now living abroad. Another 4.5 million are internally displaced. In total, that&apos;s around a third of the country&apos;s entire population. With around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territories occupied by Russia, &quot;millions more&quot; remain in the Russian-occupied territories, according to Zelensky. Furthermore, the infrastructure required for elections to take place has been destroyed in multiple settlements across the country. &quot;These multiple problems simply mean that talks about elections are too early,&quot; said Oleksandr Salizhenko, editor-in-chief of the political watchdog Chesno. At least publicly, the Kremlin has pushed for lifting Ukraine&apos;s ban on pro-Russian parties, which was introduced in 2022 due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Experts and lawmakers say that Ukraine is unlikely to agree to allow parties that openly advocate for Russia and its agenda. &quot;The people will never support such parties,&quot; Merezhko said. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how this could be politically possible, for example, to lift the ban on the (Russian-linked) Opposition Platform-For Life party or the Party of Regions. It&apos;s impossible.&quot; Fesenko said that &quot;allowing them to participate in elections would cause massive resistance.&quot; But if the wording applies to &#x201C;pro-peace parties&#x201D; that do not openly back Russia, a compromise is possible, experts say. The &#x201C;pro-peace&#x201D; label has been extensively used by Russian-linked political projects, framing those who oppose Russia and its war as being &#x201C;pro-war.&#x201D; &quot;What they might do is to formulate it differently &#x2014; that parties participating in elections can represent the interests of various ethnic and linguistic groups,&quot; Fesenko said. The Kremlin has also pushed for lifting restrictions on the Russian-backed Orthodox church in Ukraine. In August 2024, Ukraine passed a law to ban religious organizations affiliated with Russia. Such organizations can break ties with Russia within nine months, and the ban will come into effect if they fail to do so. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet with the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 27, 2013. (kremlin.ru)Experts are divided on whether Ukraine may make concessions to Russia on the status of the Russian-backed Orthodox church. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine this because people will never accept such changes,&quot; Merezhko said. &quot;Everything related to Russia is toxic. The Russian Orthodox Church is a weapon for Russia. Its legalization would be the legalization of a subversive Russian organization.&quot; The Russian Orthodox Church had been directly involved in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, supporting the attacks committed by the Russian Armed Forces. Patriarch Kirill has said Moscow is waging a &#x201C;holy war&#x201D; against Kyiv. However, Fesenko argued that, regarding the Russian-backed church, &quot;it may be possible to find some kind of compromise wording.&quot; He said that the law stipulates &quot;breaking official ties with aggressor countries,&quot; and &quot;a formulation can be found&quot; to address this issue &#x2014; such as the Russian-backed church&apos;s formal independence from Moscow. Russia may also demand an official status for the Russian language. Ukrainian is currently the only official language in Ukraine, but the constitution guarantees the protection of Russian and other minority languages. Under pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine passed a law granting Russian and other languages official minority status in certain regions in 2012. However, the Constitutional Court deemed the law unconstitutional in 2018 and repealed it. Merezhko said that he could not imagine granting Russian official status alongside Ukrainian, while Aryev said he believed the existing constitutional protection of the Russian language was sufficient. Fesenko argued that the status of an official state language for Russian is unlikely but a certain other status for the Russian language can be discussed. One of Russia&apos;s demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine is so-called &quot;demilitarization&quot; &#x2014; a unilateral decrease in the number of Ukrainian army personnel. &quot;Moscow would, of course, be delighted with this outcome and has been pushing for Ukraine to be limited to a military that would be mostly symbolic and totally unable to defend the country from further attacks by Russia,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Without serious security guarantees, however, I cannot see Kyiv agreeing to such a measure.&quot; Male volunteers in military uniform at the conscription point after signing a contract with the Ukrainian army in Unspecified, Ukraine, on March 26, 2024. (Serhii Mykhalchuk / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)Fesenko argued that the only way this would be palatable for Ukraine is to impose similar restrictions on both the Ukrainian and Russian armies. &quot;For economic and demographic reasons, they&apos;ll both have to (reduce the size of the army),&quot; Wolff said. &quot;But I am not sure that either side will accept legally binding upper limits.&quot; Merezhko argued that &quot;Putin can agree only to such ceasefire conditions that would allow him to attempt again, after some time, to capture Kyiv and destroy Ukrainian statehood.&quot; &quot;That is the problem,&quot; he added. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s and Putin&apos;s goals are diametrically opposed, leaving no common ground for negotiations.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/which-clauses-of-potential-peace-deal-would-be-acceptable-for-ukraine-and-realistic/	2025-02-12T11:56:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195733995.jpg
US to release Russian cybercrime boss in exchange for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, Reuters reports	Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cybercrime boss who was serving a prison sentence in the U.S., will be released in exchange for the return of American teacher Marc Fogel, Reuters reported on Feb. 12, citing an unnamed U.S. official. Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for agreeing to the deal and called it a step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia&apos;s sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev arranged the exchange, Reuters reported, citing a source close to the negotiations. Vinnik was detained in Greece in 2017 at the request of the U.S., who accused Vinnik of laundering at least $4 billion dollars in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings, and other criminal activity through the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e. Vinnik must forfeit over $100 million to the U.S. government and is currently in northern California awaiting transfer back to Russia. The official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, did not specify when Vinnik was to travel to Russia. Fogel is a 63-year-old schoolteacher who was serving a 14-year sentence after being detained at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana. He was flown out of Russia on Feb. 11 by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy Steve Witkoff. Three people were also released from prison in Belarus on Feb. 12, the Trump administration announced. One American whose name was undisclosed and two others, journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Andrei Kuznechyk and Alena Maushuk, were released by the Belarusian government.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-release-russian-bitcoin-suspect-in-exchange-for-fogel-media-reports/	2025-02-12T11:20:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-997822070.jpg
Restoring Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic objective,' Pentagon chief says	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that it is unrealistic to expect that Ukraine can restore its 2014 borders in any negotiations with Moscow on ending its war. Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region and annexed Crimea in 2014 following the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. During a speech at the Ramstein summit, Hegseth said that the U.S. also wants to see Ukraine as &quot;sovereign and prosperous,&quot; but that &quot;we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine&apos;s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.&quot; &quot;Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,&quot; he added. Hegseth also said the U.S. does not believe that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of negotiations. The Pentagon chief added that any security guarantees provided to Ukraine must also be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops.&quot; &quot;To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier in the day to participate in the Ramstein-format meeting. As Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office, the U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry.	https://kyivindependent.com/returning-to-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-is-unrealistic-objective-pentagon-chief-says/	2025-02-12T09:55:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196790881.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 12. Hours prior, Trump held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and agreed that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will start &quot;immediately.&quot; In a post on Truth Social, Trump said both agreed that &quot;we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Volodymyr Zelensky, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.&quot; According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the two leaders spoke for 90 minutes and Putin invited Trump to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-holds-talks-with-zelensky-following-his-1-5-hour-long-conversation-with-putin/	2025-02-12T09:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771-1.jpg
US Senate confirms Ukraine-skeptic Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence	The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence on Feb. 10. The former lawmaker has previously blamed NATO for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and faced scrutiny for her controversial foreign policy views. As director of national intelligence, Gabbard will be in charge of U.S. spy agencies. Gabbard is a National Guard veteran and former Democratic congress member who left the party in 2022 and began campaigning alongside U.S. President Donald Trump. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never led a government department or agency. She has previously repeated Kremlin talking points justifying the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia&apos;s legitimate security concerns,&quot; she wrote on &#xA0;X at the start of the invasion. Gabbard has also argued that the eastward expansion of NATO had provoked Moscow and claimed that the U.S. was fueling a proxy war with Russia that could lead to a &quot;forever war.&quot; During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Gabbard said she was &quot;offended&quot; by a question from Republican Senator Jerry Moran over whether Russia would &quot;get a pass&quot; from her in light of her past statements. &quot;Because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about our own nation, our own security, and the interests of the American people. No country, group, or individual will get a pass.&quot; When asked who she blamed for the war in Ukraine, Gabbard backtracked on her prior remarks about NATO and U.S. President Joe Biden.&quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war in Ukraine,&quot; she said. Gabbard also dismissed claims that she helped amplify pro-Russian viewpoints. &quot;I don&apos;t pay attention to Russian propaganda,&quot; she said. Senators also grilled Gabbard on her controversial 2017 meeting with former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a visit that sparked outrage from both Republicans and Democrats. The Russian-backed regime was accused of human rights violations, including the use of illegal chemical weapons. &quot;I just do not understand how you can blame NATO for Putin&apos;s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and when Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, you didn&apos;t condemn him,&quot; said Senator Mark Warner, the committee&apos;s senior Democrat. Gabbard defended the meeting with Assad, saying it was an opportunity to ask &quot;tough questions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-senate-confirms-ukraine-skeptic-tulsi-gabbard-as-director-of-national-intelligence/	2025-02-12T09:44:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701925.jpg

US Treasury Secretary meets Zelensky, passes along draft agreement on critical minerals	U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Feb. 12 and passed him a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. minerals agreement, Interfax Ukraine reported. President Donald Trump announced the day prior that Bessent would arrive in Ukraine soon, without disclosing the date of the American official&apos;s visit. &quot;We talked about minerals... I know that our team has been given the first draft of this document on a partnership between our countries,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I really want our team to work on this document. We received this document today. We will do everything so that our teams can quickly agree and sign this document,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump previously suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Ukraine with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Zelensky has said he is open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for continued support from Washington. Bessent is the first representative of the new U.S. administration after Trump&apos;s return to the White House. The Presidential Office also said previously that Ukraine is preparing to host Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-treasury-secretary-meets-zelensky-passes-draft-agreement-on-critical-minerals/	2025-02-12T09:03:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197389153.jpg
Ukraine must 'build NATO on its territory' if not invited to alliance, Zelensky says	Ukraine is not giving up on its NATO aspirations, but if denied an invitation to the alliance, it &quot;must build NATO on its territory&quot; by strengthening the military, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Economist in an interview published on Feb. 12. &quot;We have to double it. Double. To be on the same level as the Russian army,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C., that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Zelensky acknowledged in the interview that Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO is unlikely due to opposition from the U.S., Germany, and Hungary, but believes the latter would change its mind if U.S. President Donald Trump asked. He believes Trump could provide security guarantees to Ukraine without even having to discuss them with Russia and that Europe could help finance Ukraine&apos;s defense, with &quot;missiles, long-distance missiles and Patriot (air-defense systems).&#x201D; When asked whether he had a plan B if all of the above did not work out, Zelensky replied, &quot;This is plan B.&quot; Ukraine has relied on NATO member states for military aid in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-build-nato-on-its-territory-if-it-isnt-invited-into-alliance-zelensky-says/	2025-02-12T09:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump tariffs hit Ukraine's steel industry	The following is the Feb. 11, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine&#x2019;s steel industry &#x2014; one of its most critical sectors &#x2014; just can&#x2019;t seem to catch a break as of late. First a critical mine closes, then comes U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s tariffs on steel. Last week, we published an article on what the loss of the Pokrovsk mine that produces coking coal &#x2014; necessary to make steel &#x2014; would mean for Ukraine. The mine was the last remaining coking coal site in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The country&#x2019;s steel producers will now have to increase imports of the fuel, racking up transport costs, business reporter Dominic Culverwell writes. Importing more coking coal will hinder the global competitiveness of Ukrainian steel, which has already taken a pounding since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Some analysts are unsure if Ukrainian producers can afford to cover the needed imports. &#x201C;To produce the 2024 volume of steel &#x2014; 7.5 million metric tons &#x2014; we would need (to import) 1.9 million tons of coal. We have doubts whether it would be possible to import such quantities and definitely it would further increase the costs of our steel producers,&#x201D; Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association, told the Kyiv Independent. And then came Trump&#x2019;s executive order on Feb. 10 imposing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions. Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook that Ukraine&#x2019;s metallurgical products make up 57.9% of Ukraine&apos;s exports to the U.S., or in dollar amounts, $503 million out of $869 million. It&#x2019;s unclear what time frame those figures represent. True &#x2014; the share of Ukrainian products in U.S. steel products is minimal and won&#x2019;t have a significant impact on U.S. producers. But it&#x2019;s still another blow to the country&#x2019;s largest exports of metallurgical companies &#x2014; ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih and Interpipe &#x2014; already hurting due to the war. &quot;In recent years, we have made every effort to ensure that Ukrainian steel remains outside the 25% tariff limit in the U.S.,&quot; Svyrydenko said, implying that these efforts have been unsuccessful. The minister added that she and her colleagues are &#x201C;working actively with partners to find an optimal solution by March 12,&#x201D; when the tariffs come into effect.

Trump and his team had already announced it was looking to exchange U.S. support for Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, which President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s administration appeared to be open to, but two things appear to be new here. First, the size of the deal, and second, that any deal wouldn&#x2019;t be in exchange for future support, but compensation for U.S. aid already provided to Ukraine. It&#x2019;s unclear yet if the shift in rhetoric changes Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to enter into such an agreement. We&#x2019;re likely to find out more in the coming days &#x2014; Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11 that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine this week to discuss a potential deal between Kyiv and Washington on critical minerals.

Just last week, Reuters reported that Ukraine would maintain a high level of gas imports of 16.3 million cubic meters on Feb. 9 after the country began sharply increasing imports following a series of Russian attacks on its gas facilities. Earlier in the week, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. Ukraine&#x2019;s daily gas consumption was about 110 million cubic meters last month, Serhiy Makogon, the former head of the country&#x2019;s transit operator, told Reuters.

(Photo by hurricanehank/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The year of KyivstarUkraine&#x2019;s anti-trust regulator approved Kyivstar&#x2019;s acquisition of taxi service Uklon, paving the way for its purchase, Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov announced at an American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine event on Feb. 6. That&#x2019;s big news on its own. Kyivstar is Ukraine&#x2019;s leading mobile operator &#x2014; Uklon, the country&#x2019;s most popular ride-hailing service. The deal is reportedly valued at $40-60 million. What&#x2019;s more interesting here is everything going on with Kyivstar as of late. At the start of the full-scale invasion, it was at risk of nationalization over its parent company Veon&#x2019;s Russian shareholders. But in the last couple of months, Kyivstar announced a deal with Elon Musk&#x2019;s Starlink to provide direct satellite-to-cell service. Last month, news broke that Kyivstar would be the first company to be listed on Nasdaq &#x2014; which Komarov said would likely happen in Q3 &#x2014; and now, the Uklon purchase. What does it all mean? As one colleague noted, the Nasdaq listing plans might be a way for Kyivstar to get away from its former Russian ties. Given French billionaire Xavier Niel&#x2019;s purchase of the third-largest mobile operator Lifecell last year, I&#x2019;d say developing telecoms &#x2014; which involves a country&#x2019;s critical infrastructure &#x2014; is a prime target for post-war investment in Ukraine.

(Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)Europe stepping inThe European Investment Bank announced on Feb. 10 that it had signed agreements to mobilize close to 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) in investments into Ukraine&#x2019;s public and private sectors &#x2014; a welcome move as the U.S. cuts funding abroad. Nadia Calvino, the EIB&apos;s president, said at a press briefing that she had discussed Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent funding needs with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to see where the bank could fill the gaps if international partners withdraw their support. &quot;We discussed the priority areas where the EIB could step up its support &#x2014; for example, in the areas of border management, transport, energy, and municipalities,&quot; Calvino said in Kyiv during her first visit to the country since taking up office as head of the EIB a year ago. The investment announced on Feb. 10 includes 420 million euros ($433 million) in Ukraine&#x2019;s public sector to help restore critical infrastructure such as energy, heating, water supply, hospitals, schools, and social housing. On the private sector side, the bank has signed an agreement to mobilize close to 500 million euros ($515 million) in financing for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the whole country, including in front-line regions, Calvino said.

Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted in favor of buying two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on Feb. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the lawmakers last week to approve the project, calling it a &quot;key to energy independence.&quot; Some lawmakers and anti-corruption activists have criticized the deal, arguing that the reactors are obsolete and expensive. The parliament has long struggled to pass the law, prompting Bulgaria to extend the deadline for concluding the deal until March. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, France&#x2019;s trade chief Laurent Saint-Martin said that France has been working with Ukraine on rare mineral exploitation for a long time, with French experts from organizations like BRGM and the inter-ministerial Direction for Rare Mineral Supply. &#x201C;France remains fully involved in this sector, and we continue discussions with Ukrainian authorities,&#x201D; Saint-Martin said. The European Union will receive a second tranche of 2 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from profits generated by frozen Russian Central Bank assets that are meant for Ukraine and its war effort.

Russia's growing shadow fleet sends a dangerous signal, expert warns	Russia has resorted to a &quot;shadow fleet&quot; to transport its oil and gas to get around Western sanctions and price caps. These ships have murky owners and are difficult to trace. They are growing in number and helping keep Russia&apos;s war machine alive while posing security and environmental risks. So far, sanctions have failed to stop the fleet. But Western countries are upping efforts to crack down on the dangerous ships. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Transatlantic Security Initiative, to find out what options the West has and how dangerous the shadow fleet actually is.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-growing-shadow-fleet-sends-a-dangerous-signal-expert-warns/	2025-02-12T07:23:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/4_0.jpg
Kyiv and Washington’s mobilization age blame game misses the point	&#x201C;The biggest problem is the lack of people.&#x201D; These words, heard by journalists, including myself, from Ukrainian soldiers and commanders across the front line for the past year, are no outlier. For most of 2024 and into 2025, &#xA0;Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest issue on the battlefield has not been firepower but manpower &#x2014; specifically infantry. In the face of Russia&#x2019;s seemingly relentless assaults on multiple fronts, Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive infantry positions are often undermanned, and in some cases, as I have heard personally from soldiers fighting near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, not manned at all. Under these conditions, the Ukrainian military has been increasingly overstretched, opening up noticeable weak points in its lines that Russia has become better and better at exploiting. The solution seems obvious on the surface: Ukraine needs to bring more people into the army, both to replenish losses and to allow for proper rotation of front-line units. That means more mobilization, especially of men physically fit and strong enough to handle the brutal conditions of modern trench warfare. In a rare case of public pressure on Kyiv to change its internal policy on how the war is fought, representatives of the Biden administration, including then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and then-National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, called for further lowering the mobilization age to 18 on multiple occasions. The age was already lowered once in the first half of 2024, from 27 to 25, as part of broader changes to mobilization legislation that were passed by the parliament after months of deliberation and controversy. Wary of how such a move would exacerbate the internal tensions that forced mobilization already brings to wartime Ukrainian society, President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the idea outright. He argues that without the promised equipment for new brigades, taking more young men out of civilian life makes no sense. &#x201C;We must focus on equipping existing brigades and training personnel to use this equipment,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a post on X on Dec. 10. &#x201C;We must not compensate for the lack of equipment and training with the youth of soldiers.&#x201D; Now, mobilization age could be one of the rare issues where the new Trump administration aligns with its predecessor on Ukraine. Speaking on ABC News just a week before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, then-nominee and now National Security Advisor Mike Waltz again pushed the issue. &quot;If Ukrainians have asked the entire world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy... We need to see those manpower issues addressed,&quot; he said. Though hopeful early signs suggest Trump will broadly support Kyiv&#x2019;s call for &#x201C;peace through strength,&#x201D; the mobilization age debate threatens to become a dangerous flashpoint in the future of bilateral cooperation. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. The blame game between Washington and Kyiv must be nipped in the bud because if it isn&#x2019;t, their common aim &#x2014; forcing Russia to abandon its war of conquest &#x2014; will not just suffer but could collapse entirely. Ukrainian military personnel are awarded medals for their service on Ukraine Defender Day near Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Pierre Crom / Getty Images)Both sides have seemingly reasonable arguments, but they obscure deeper issues under the surface. Washington&#x2019;s demand for Kyiv to simply be &#x201C;all in&#x201D; and lower the mobilization age coldly ignores how painful the human cost of three years of full-scale war has been for Ukraine. No sovereign country in the 21st century should have to endure what Ukraine has suffered: a campaign of strategic attrition waged by a much larger neighbor, blending Soviet-style human wave tactics with the brutality of modern drone warfare. Forced mobilization on a large scale &#x2014; especially when voluntary enlistment has plummeted &#x2014; represents, in many ways, a fundamental breakdown of the social contract between state and citizen. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing his own manpower issues, has been desperate to avoid a large-scale forced mobilization, despite the chance of internal unrest being close to zero. Ukraine, as a democracy built on individual rights and freedoms, faces an even greater challenge. It&#x2019;s easy to point from a safe Western country to the existential threat faced by Ukraine and expect military-aged men to still be lining up to fight as they did in 2022. But for young men bombarded with images and stories of the horrors of the trenches for three years, serving in infantry is often seen as a one-way ticket to injury or death. On top of that, the demographic argument is well-documented: the generation Washington wants to make eligible for forced mobilization is not only one of the smallest in Ukraine&#x2019;s population pyramid but is also crucial for rebuilding the country&#x2019;s postwar future. Chasing a delusional scenario in which neither Ukraine or Russia is defeated and the world eventually goes back to normal, the U.S.&#x2019; policy of holding back key weapons systems for years and drip feeding aid to Ukraine &#x201C;as long as it takes&#x201D; remains the main reason Kyiv finds itself in this position now, seemingly running out of manpower. That said, Kyiv&#x2019;s rebuttal &#x2014; that Ukraine needs more weapons, not conscripts &#x2014; is also fundamentally dishonest with respect to the reality on the ground. This failure was starkly exposed around New Year&#x2019;s with Ukraine&#x2019;s newly formed 155th Mechanized Brigade &#x2014; trained and equipped by France as the intended poster child of a new program where foreign partners each took on a brigade. The deal was meant to be simple: France provides the heavy weapons, while Ukraine supplies the personnel. Paris kept its end of the bargain, but Kyiv failed to do so. Ukraine peeled off bits of the brigade to plug holes in the front line, resulting in a poorly organized and unmotivated brigade that saw over 1,000 desertions before firing a shot. The 155th is not the only such problematic case, but part of a tendency that was so damaging that Zelensky moved to cancel the formation of further new brigades in January. Ukraine&#x2019;s chronic struggles with building effective fortified defensive lines ahead of Russian offensives, as well as its Soviet-style command culture, marked by frantic withdrawals from near-surrounded cities, have also led to higher losses than necessary. While Ukraine does need a greater inflow of physically fit men to refill its ranks, it must first improve how it utilizes the human resources it already has. There&#x2019;s little point in exacerbating domestic tensions with a new law to draft tens of thousands of younger Ukrainian men if they are sent into an environment of poor training and leadership, where their chances of survival are already slim. Recent decisions to cancel the formation of new brigades and shift the military into a corps-based system offer hope that Kyiv is beginning to address these issues. Having said this, yes, Kyiv does need to face the mobilization problem head on: Ultimately, when it comes to acknowledging the problems that plague the defense of the country, there is no getting around the basic need for more people. Part of that likely means lowering the mobilization age, if not to 18, then perhaps to 21. If the last mobilization law is anything to go by, this process could drag out for months, as Ukrainian lawmakers from all parties avoid association with the unpopular measure. Again, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. Just as with other urgent internal issues, the first step is to take responsibility &#x2014; to prioritize Ukraine&#x2019;s future over short-term approval ratings. 2025 could bring peace to Ukraine, but only if Russian forces are halted by a strong, consolidated Ukrainian defense. Even if a peace deal doesn&#x2019;t return occupied Ukrainian territory, it can&#x2019;t come about without first shattering Moscow&#x2019;s conviction that it can break Ukraine. This monumental task can only be achieved together: both Kyiv and Washington must do everything possible to pressure Russia, on the battlefield and the world stage. To do that, they must align their vision, communicate clearly, and most importantly, stop expecting the other to do more before acting themselves. Ukraine&#x2019;s manpower crisis is a great place to start.

Ukraine introduces 1-year military contract for young volunteers, facing mixed reactions	Ukraine&apos;s government approved a one-year contract for volunteers aged 18-24 on Feb. 11, aiming to boost recruitment with financial incentives and social benefits, but the decision has sparked mixed reactions within the military community. The contract includes basic general military training, vocational training, and an adaptation course in an army unit. Volunteers will receive a one-time monetary aid payment of Hr 1 million ($24,000) and a monthly allowance of up to Hr 120,000 ($3,000). The move comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. for Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. President Volodymyr Zelensky has resisted lowering the draft age, arguing it could harm Ukraine&apos;s long-term future. Instead, Ukraine aims to attract younger volunteer recruits through benefits, such as a 0% mortgage after completing service and social guarantees. Upon completion, volunteers will have the right to travel abroad and be exempt from mobilization for 12 months. The military faces a critical personnel shortfall, struggling to replenish infantry gaps amid battlefield losses. The current mobilization system requires indefinite service, discouraging enlistment, while the new contract is designed to appeal to young volunteers unwilling to commit long-term. The decision has drawn criticism from frontline soldiers, with some questioning why existing troops receive fewer benefits. Ukrainian soldier and paramedic Alina Mykhailova voiced her frustration, asking, &quot;Why are those who enlisted earlier in a worse position? Where are their guarantees, social protection, and fair service bonus?&quot; Former soldier and journalist Masi Nayem echoed the sentiment, saying he received messages from comrades expressing dissatisfaction: &quot;It seems that choosing between unpopular decisions, they decided to disregard the motivation of those already in service.&quot; The Defense Ministry has yet to respond to concerns raised by active-duty soldiers, but the debate underscores the broader challenge of balancing recruitment efforts with maintaining morale among Ukraine&apos;s existing forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-one-year-contracts-for-volunteers-aged-18-24-defense-ministry-says/	2025-02-12T06:14:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243729890.jpg
Ukrainian draft officer attacked at Kharkiv military enlistment office	A Ukrainian Armed Forces service member was injured in a violent attack at a military enlistment office in Kharkiv on Feb. 12, the office said, adding that the suspect had been detained. The incident follows a series of recent attacks against military enlistment officers. Last week, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) revealed that Russia recruited the perpetrator of an explosion at a draft office in Rivne on Feb. 1 that injured eight service members and killed the suspected bomber. In the Kharkiv attack, the assailant reportedly used tear gas and stabbed the service member, who has been hospitalized. His life is not in danger, the enlistment office said. &quot;An attack on a serviceman in the line of duty is a serious crime that must be investigated as soon as possible,&quot; the statement read. The incident occurred in Kharkiv&apos;s Saltivskyi district as the draft officer was carrying out checks of personal military data. The 35-year-old suspect attempted to flee the scene but was detained, the National Police said. The attack is being investigated as an attempted murder and obstruction of military activities, with the suspect potentially facing up to 15 years in prison or life imprisonment. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Another explosion near a military enlistment office in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv faces challenges in mobilizing troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-attacked-at-military-enlistment-office-in-kharkiv/	2025-02-12T06:04:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg
NATO reaction to Russian attack would be 'devastating,' Rutte warns	NATO&apos;s reaction to a potential Russian attack would be &quot;devastating,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said during a press conference ahead of the defense ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12. &quot;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin attacks NATO, the reaction will be devastating. He will lose,&quot; Rutte said. Allied and Ukrainian officials are gathering at the NATO headquarters for a ministerial meeting and the 26th summit of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) to coordinate strategy in fending off Russian aggression in Ukraine. The meetings come at an uncertain time as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a quick peace deal in Ukraine while being evasive on the question of military support for the besieged country. Trump&apos;s return to the White House also spells uncertainty for the alliance. His past comments have cast doubt on his readiness to assist European allies in case of Russian aggression. When asked whether he is worried about Trump&apos;s willingness to aid Europe in case of another conflict, Rutte said European countries are currently addressing weaknesses in their own defense capabilities. Defense spending will be at the top of the agenda of the ministerial meeting, Rutte said, adding that he expects the allies to raise the spending benchmarks from 2% of GDP to &quot;north of 3%.&quot; Trump has previously urged NATO partners to hike defense spending to as much as 5%, a level not achieved by a single member, including the U.S., in 2024. During the press conference, the secretary-general backed Trump&apos;s stance that Europe should ramp up its support for Ukraine to make it more &quot;equalized&quot; in regard to the U.S. &quot;The stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger they will be at the negotiating table,&quot; Rutte concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-reaction-to-russian-attack-will-be-devastating-rutte-warns/	2025-02-12T05:48:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
US to release Russian citizen in exchange for Fogel 'in coming days,' Kremlin claims	Washington agreed to release a Russian national held in a U.S. prison after Moscow freed American citizen Marc Fogel, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the pro-state Russian news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 12. &quot;A Russian citizen will return to Russia in the coming days,&quot; Peskov said without revealing his identity. Fogel, a schoolteacher detained at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana, was flown out of Russia on Feb. 11 by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for agreeing to the deal and called it a step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. The U.S. president did not reveal what Moscow would receive in return, saying only that the Russian side did not ask for &quot;much.&quot; When asked by a journalist whether the Russian citizen involved in the exchange is Alexander Vinnik, a suspected cybercriminal detained in Greece in 2017, Peskov declined to confirm and said the name would be announced once the individual was in Russia. The Kremlin&apos;s spokesperson did not provide further details about the talks between Washington and Moscow but noted that the contacts have intensified over the past few days. The U.S. and Russia have carried out a number of prisoner exchanges over the past few years, with the largest one taking place in August 2024. At the time, the Biden administration negotiated the release of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, ex-Marine Paul Whelan, and a number of Russian opposition figures in exchange for spies, assassins, and cyber-criminals held in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-release-russian-citizen-in-exchange-for-fogel/	2025-02-12T04:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198419238.jpg
Zelensky ready to meet Trump in US once details are arranged	President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to meet his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, in the U.S. once the date and other details are agreed upon, Zelensky said in an interview with The Guardian published in full on Feb. 12. &quot;As for President Trump, he said he was waiting for me in Washington. And we are very much looking forward to our teams agreeing on the dates and other details for a meeting in the U.S.,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. Zelensky&apos;s comments follow Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 7 that the two leaders may meet in Washington this week. The Ukrainian president indicated that no specific plans for a bilateral meeting have been set. &quot;As soon as this is agreed, I am ready for the meeting,&quot; Zelensky added. Later this week, Ukraine&apos;s head of state is expected to meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance during the Munich Security Conference. The Trump administration has intensified contact with both Kyiv and Moscow as the U.S. president aims to broker a swift peace deal and end the full-scale war nearing its third anniversary. While providing little details on how he plans to achieve a settlement, Trump suggested that Ukraine could secure U.S. support in exchange for its rare earth minerals. Zelensky said in the interview that he is ready to discuss various options for the resource extraction deal as long as they are &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to visit Ukraine this week to discuss the rare earth deal, while Trump&apos;s special peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, is set to arrive on Feb. 20. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also met U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for the first time on Feb. 12 on the sidelines of the Ramstein-format meeting in Brussels. Separately, Trump has claimed he held one or more phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and voiced intent to meet the Russian leader in person, a step welcomed by the Kremlin.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-ready-to-meet-trump-in-us/	2025-02-12T04:18:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361-1.jpg
Kremlin rejects territorial exchange in potential Ukraine peace talks	Russia has ruled out any discussion of exchanging territories in potential negotiations with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 12, according to the state news agency TASS. Peskov&apos;s statement follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks in an interview with The Guardian, where he suggested Ukraine could cede the territory it controls in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in exchange for Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. &quot;This is impossible. Russia has never discussed and will never discuss the topic of exchanging its territory,&quot; Peskov responded. Kyiv has previously signaled that its cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast, launched in August 2024, could be used in potential peace talks with Russia. Zelensky now confirmed that the offer could be on the table if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in opening negotiations. Peskov claimed that Russia would be able to expel Ukrainian forces from its territory. While Moscow has reclaimed some lost ground in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces continue holding positions in the region and recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles). Zelensky did not specify what regions could be exchanged for Kursk Oblast territories. Russia holds roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s land and illegally announced the annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian regions &#x2013; the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts &#x2013; in September 2022. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin named a complete Ukrainian withdrawal from these regions as a key condition for talks, which Kyiv rejected. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has gained momentum since Trump took office on Jan. 20. His administration has set a 100-day goal to broker a resolution, with special envoy Keith Kellogg expected to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. The Kremlin has already indicated readiness to hold talks with Trump regarding the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/territorial-exchange-impossible-in-any-peace-negotiations-kremlin-spox-says/	2025-02-12T04:02:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
Ukraine's SBU detains its counter-terrorist center chief accused of working for Russia	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the head of the agency&apos;s counter-terrorism department, who is suspected of working for Russian intelligence, SBU head Vasyl Maliuk announced on Feb. 12. While the agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s name, the Kyiv Independent&apos;s SBU sources identified him as Colonel Dmytro Koziura. The suspect&apos;s illicit activities were documented in 14 separate cases, according to Maliuk. The SBU chief emphasized that the operation to uncover and detain him required &quot;all possible overt and covert methods.&quot; The case sheds light on Russian efforts to infiltrate and undermine Ukraine&apos;s security services amid the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. &quot;In the process, we managed to document the collection and transmission of relevant information to Russia,&quot; Maliuk added. The suspect was said to be working with Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB). &quot;Using encrypted software bookmarks, we penetrated the traitor&apos;s gadgets &#x2014; mobile terminals and computers. We basically lived with him and conducted audio and video monitoring,&quot; the SBU chief added. The SBU head described the operation as part of an ongoing internal purge and warned that no Russian infiltration attempts would succeed. Further details of the case are expected to be released soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-captures-anti-terrorist-center-chief-suspected-of-working-for-russia/	2025-02-12T03:33:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/download.jpg
Europe faces 'total' Russian occupation without Ukraine's army, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that without Ukraine, Europe could face a full-scale Russian occupation due to Moscow&apos;s numerical advantage in forces, he said in a segment of an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 12. Zelensky highlighted the disparity in forces between Russia and Europe, saying that Ukraine&apos;s army consists of 110 brigades, while Russia fields 220 and plans to expand to 250 this year. In contrast, Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades. &quot;Without Ukraine, Europe will be totally occupied by Russia, if they want. And I believe they (Russia) have nothing else on their mind,&quot; the president said in the interview. &quot;Today, an army of 110 brigades is holding back those who have 220-230. But it&apos;s one to two,&quot; Zelensky added. The president said that while Russia&apos;s numeral advantage compared to Ukraine is two to one, in comparison to Europe, it&apos;s three to one, which is sufficient for an effective offensive. Zelensky added that Russia intends to increase its forces by 12-15 divisions &#x2014; around 150,000 troops &#x2014; through mobilization, training, and the addition of North Korean soldiers. According to the president, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence also suggests that new Russian recruits will be trained in Belarus. &quot;After that, they can launch a full-scale ivasion from there. But who said that it would be to Ukraine? Russia can invade Poland or Lithuania,&quot; Zelensky warned. The president said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military consists of 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against the 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Zelensky also disclosed in the interview that an assassination attempt on him at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 led to casualties inside the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-could-face-russian-occupation-without-ukraines-army-zelensky-warns/	2025-02-12T03:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247442902-1677276960d6gz6.jpg
Defense Minister Umerov meets Pentagon chief Hegseth for the first time	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for the first time on Feb. 12 on the sidelines of the Ramstein-format meeting in Brussels. The 26th summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) is the first one chaired by the U.K. rather than the U.S. as Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s accession to office. Umerov did not provide any details on his meeting with the U.S. defense secretary. The summit, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. This marks the first Ramstein summit during U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has prompted concerns not only about the future of the UDCG but also about the overall allied support for Ukraine. While pledging to broker a swift peace deal, the U.S. president has been evasive regarding the continued military backing for Kyiv. The UDCG, comprising over 50 countries, including all NATO members, typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Ramstein summit coincides with other key events this week, including the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting and the Munich Security Conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-minister-umerov-meets-pentagon-chief-hegseth-for-the-first-time/	2025-02-12T02:43:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/479492684_1019797513301922_7131251246340690718_n.jpg
Russian missile attack on Kyiv damages state-run TV channel's office	A Russian ballistic missile strike on Kyiv on Feb. 12 damaged the office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim, the news channels announced. The office sustained damage to windows and equipment, but the channels said they remain operational. The statements mentioned no casualties. According to a TSN journalist on the ground, everything within a 300-meter radius was damaged; parts of the facades were demolished, and doors were blown off. &quot;For terrorists who violate any conventions and disregard international law, the media is a desirable target,&quot; the Freedom TV channel said in a statement. Russia has previously targeted Ukraine&apos;s media infrastructure, including a strike on Kharkiv&apos;s TV broadcasting tower in April 2024 and Kyiv&apos;s TV tower in March 2022. The morning attack on Kyiv struck an industrial zone housing multiple office centers. Footage from the scene shows shattered glass, structural damage to buildings, and wrecked cars. At least one person was killed and four injured in the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv-damages-freedom-tv-channel-office/	2025-02-12T02:33:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/4-1.jpg
People were killed inside Presidential Office' — Zelensky comments on Russia's assassination attempts in 2022	An attempt to assassinate &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 resulted in people killed inside the Presidential Office, Zelensky said in an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. &quot;There were people who wanted to kill (me), there were gunshots, and more. Some people were killed here, inside the Presidential Office, others were defending us,&quot; Zelensky revealed. Zelensky did not specify whether the fatalities included Russians, Ukrainians, or both. The comments shed further light on previously reported attempts by Russia to eliminate the Ukrainian leadership in Kyiv in early 2022. At least three assassination attempts at Zelensky were reported by March 2022 as Russian forces were pushing toward Ukraine&apos;s capital before being defeated in the battle of Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/people-were-killed-inside-presidential-office-zelensky-reveals-details-of-russias-assassination-attempts-in-2022/	2025-02-12T01:53:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Russia's sanctioned ex-central bank official takes up in-person IMF duties in Washington	Former Russian Deputy Central Bank Governor Ksenia Yudaeva, who is under U.S. sanctions, is working in person at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, Russia&apos;s state news agency TASS reported on Feb. 11. Yudaeva has moved to Washington after the U.S. Treasury Department, still under the Biden administration at the time, granted her permission to transition from remote to in-person duties as Russia&apos;s IMF executive director, Bloomberg reported in January, citing sources. Yudaeva, sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, previously served as an advisor to Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. In November 2024, Yudaeva was appointed to represent Russia and Syria at the IMF but was initially working remotely. The IMF executive board is comprised of 25 directors who are elected by member countries or coalitions. While each director has voting power, influence is primarily determined by a nation&apos;s financial contributions to the organization. Though the decision to allow Yudaeva to work in Washington was reportedly made by the Biden administration, the sanctioned Russian official began working in the U.S. amid President Donald Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow to broker a peace deal in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctioned-russian-deputy-central-bank-governor-yudaeva-resumes-in-person-duties-at-imf/	2025-02-12T01:39:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-948228448.jpg
Coordinating allied support — Umerov lists Ukraine's priorities at Ramstein-format summit	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has begun his work at the 26th Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in Brussels on Feb. 12, the first event of its kind not chaired by the U.S. The meeting, chaired by U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, will focus on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. &quot;The main goal is strengthening military cooperation and real mechanisms to support Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. The agenda includes ensuring a stable and timely supply of military aid in 2025, accelerating the delivery of critical weapons like air defense systems, aviation, and ammunition, and fostering joint projects with European partners. This meeting follows the 25th gathering on Jan. 9, which focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. This marks the first Ramstein summit during U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has prompted concerns not only about the future of the UDCG but also about the overall allied support for Ukraine. While pledging to broker a swift peace deal, the U.S. president has been evasive regarding the continued military backing for Kyiv. &quot;This is an important stage in strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and coordinating further actions of the allies,&quot; Umerov added. The UDCG, comprising over 50 countries, including all NATO members, typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Ramstein summit coincides with other key events this week, including the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting and the Munich Security Conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-arrives-in-brussels-for-ramstein/	2025-02-12T01:01:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp
Pentagon chief Hegseth arrives in Brussels ahead of Ramstein-format meeting	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Feb. 12 as the allies are gathering for a Ramstein-format meeting. The U.K. has taken over the U.S.&apos;s role in chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as Washington revises its foreign and security policy after President Donald Trump&apos;s accession to office. &quot;Our commitment is clear: NATO must be a stronger, more lethal force&#x2014;not a diplomatic club. Time for allies to meet the moment,&quot; Hegseth said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-chief-hegseth-arrives-in-brussels-for-ramstein-meeting/	2025-02-12T00:50:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GjkpbskWsAAsIip.jpg
Russia braces for economic crisis as it revives Covid-era committee	Russia has reactivated a special economic commission initially created during the Covid-19 pandemic to monitor struggling industries and implement relief measures, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 11, citing Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. The news comes as the Kremlin reportedly grows increasingly concerned by the state of Russia&apos;s economy amid Western sanctions and soaring inflation caused by record wartime spending. Novak said that the commission resumed work in December 2024, focusing on nine key sectors and over 2,000 enterprises. Among the primary risks is a &quot;decline in investment activity,&quot; according to Novak. Several industries, including coal, metallurgy, and timber, are experiencing sharp downturns due to sanctions and falling exports. Coal companies, facing an 80 billion ruble ($845 million) loss from plummeting exports, have begun closing mines, prompting fears of mass bankruptcies. The government is already formulating support measures. Russia&apos;s metallurgical plants, struggling with reduced access to foreign markets, are also expected to receive state assistance, followed by the timber industry, whose exports have dropped by a third. The agricultural sector is also distressed, suffering from drought and poor harvests. Russia&apos;s wheat production declined by 16% in 2024, while corn, barley, and sugar beet yields dropped by nearly 20%. On Feb. 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that inflation remains a significant challenge, directing the government to implement measures to stabilize prices in 2025. According to The Moscow Times, consumer prices rose 9.5% in 2024 and have since climbed to 9.9% year over year. The Russian Central Bank, which has maintained an interest rate of 21%, sees &quot;no signs of a sustainable slowdown in price growth&quot; due to sanctions, currency depreciation, and high defense spending. The Central Bank forecasts inflation to drop to 5.2% and 8.6% by the end of 2025. Its next policy meeting on Feb. 14 will determine further economic stabilization measures.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reactivates-special-economic-commission-to-monitor-struggling-industries/	2025-02-12T00:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2153661926.jpg
German Navy facing sabotage attempts, navy chief says; warns of Russian threat	Germany&apos;s Navy has recently encountered repeated sabotage attempts, German Navy Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Jan Christian Kaack told N-TV on Feb. 11, presenting them as an effort to &quot;test&quot; NATO. Kaack said the incidents included infiltration attempts at naval bases from land and sea, as well as direct damage to vessels. While he did not specify the perpetrators, he warned that such actions were likely part of efforts to &quot;undermine public confidence&quot; and destabilize NATO. The reports come amid growing concerns over Russian hybrid warfare tactics across Europe. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea, including suspected sabotage of undersea cables linking Latvia, Sweden, and Finland, have heightened security fears and led to ramped-up allied presence in the region. &quot;In our assessment, we are being tested. They are trying to undermine the confidence of our society &#x2014; both at the national level and within the (NATO) alliance. And they are setting the stage for subsequent active military action,&quot; Kaack said. One high-profile case involved the discovery of tens of kilograms of metal shavings inside the engine of the German Navy&apos;s new Emden corvette at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the S&#xFC;ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters WDR and NDR reported. The debris could have caused significant damage if undetected, delaying the ship&apos;s transfer to the Navy. Investigators have not confirmed sabotage, but authorities are still examining the incident. Germany has stepped up countermeasures, Kaack added, emphasizing that the Russian threat in early 2025 is more severe than two years ago. He warned that experts and intelligence services anticipate Russia could be in a position to launch a conflict with NATO as early as 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-navy-sees-sabotage-attempts-amid-war-in-ukraine-navy-chief-says/	2025-02-12T00:05:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1241200421.jpg
Trump praises Putin for US teacher's release, says it could help end Russia-Ukraine war	U.S. President Donald Trump met Marc Fogel at the White House on Feb. 11 after the U.S. schoolteacher was freed from a Russian prison in a deal negotiated between Moscow and Washington. Fogel, arrested at a Russian airport in 2021 for possessing medical marijuana, was released in an agreement brokered by Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. &quot;There&apos;s good will in terms of the war,&quot; Trump said when asked if Fogel&apos;s release could be a step toward a peace deal in Ukraine. &quot;You (Fogel) could be a big part of it, actually, because it could be a big, important part of getting the war over with Ukraine.&quot; &quot;And we appreciate President (Vladimir) Putin for what he did,&quot; Trump added. When asked by a journalist whether Russia received anything in return for Fogel&apos;s release, Trump said, &quot;Not much, no. We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that&apos;s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.&quot; The U.S. president also claimed the deal was &quot;very fair, very reasonable&quot; and hinted that &quot;somebody else is being released tomorrow.&quot; Fogel&apos;s release follows Trump&apos;s claims of speaking with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, though the Kremlin has not confirmed these discussions. The U.S. president has pledged to broker a swift end to the Russia-Ukraine war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve that. Witkoff flew Fogel out of Russia on his private plane, marking the first known visit of a U.S. official to Moscow since 2021. The U.S. government classified Fogel as &quot;unjustly detained&quot; in December 2024, increasing diplomatic efforts to secure his release. Fogel&apos;s family had pushed for the designation after he was excluded from a high-profile prisoner swap in August 2024 that freed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive and ex-Marine Paul Whelan. Russia has detained several U.S. nationals since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with many serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. The U.S. has denounced many of these arrests as unjust and politically motivated. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who met U.S. Ambassador in Moscow Lynne Tracy just hours before Fogel&apos;s release, said in December 2024 that Moscow was open to further prisoner exchanges with the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-praises-putin-for-fogel-release-says-it-could-help-end-russias-war/	2025-02-11T23:24:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198417355.jpg

Russia offers to produce advanced stealth fighter jet for Indian Air Force, Reuters reports	Russia has offered to manufacture its fifth-generation Su-57 stealth fighter jet for the Indian Air Force amid deepening ties between Moscow and New Delhi, Reuters reported on Feb. 11, citing two officials. The fighter jet, which would be produced in India, comes as informal conversations continue between Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and Indian government officials for the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics, a Russian industry source told Reuters. A spokesperson for Rosoboronexport confirmed that production of the aircraft may begin as early as this year if India agrees to a deal. For years, Russia has been the largest arms supplier to India, although sanctions implemented on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have forced India to search out weapons supplies from Western countries. The Su-57, Russia&#x2019;s most modern fighter jet, has faced criticism as being plagued with mechanical challenges. The first non-prototype version crashed during a test flight in December 2019, and has been dubbed by some experts as the &quot;worst of the world&#x2019;s stealth fighters.&quot; In June 2024, a Russian versions of the aircraft were reportedly damaged after a Ukrainian strike on the Akhtubinsk airfield in the Astrakhan region in southern Russia, 589 kilometers from the front line. India previously withdrew from the project to co-develop and produce the aircraft with Russia. Despite this, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to boost defense spending and production as longstanding regional tensions with Pakistan and China persist. While India has maintained its call for a diplomatic resolution to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, it continues to deepen economic ties with Moscow. Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in July. The two countries identified nine areas for enhanced cooperation, ranging from nuclear energy to medicine. India and Russia also aim to boost bilateral trade by over 50%, targeting $100 billion annually by 2030. In December 2024, Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and Indian refining giant Reliance Industries have finalized a landmark agreement to supply 500,000 barrels of oil daily for the next 10 years, marking the largest energy partnership between the two nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-offers-to-produce-advanced-stealth-fighter-jet-for-indian-air-force-reuters-reports/	2025-02-11T21:01:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184333392.jpg
Fires reported in Kyiv following overnight missile attacks	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a missile attack against Kyiv on the morning of Feb. 12. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv City Military Administration reported that fires had broken out in the Solomianskyi and Svyatoshynskyi districts of the city. No further information was immediately available as to the extent of any damage or casualties. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that emergency crews are on their way to various parts of the city. Explosions were reported in Kyiv around 4:30 a.m. local time, according to several Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Preliminary reports indicate that four Iskander ballistic missiles were launched towards the capital. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned of the threat of Russian missile attacks targeting various regions of the country. Klitschko said that air defenses are at work in the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-following-missile-attack-on-kyiv/	2025-02-11T18:56:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/_DSF3368.jpg
Russia may find opportunity to launch large-scale war on Europe within 5 years, Danish intelligence warns	Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years, if Moscow &quot;perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,&quot; an unclassified intelligence assessment from the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS) warned. &quot;Russia perceives itself as being in conflict with the West and is preparing for a war against NATO. While no decision to initiate such a war has been made, Russia is building the capacity to make that choice if deemed necessary,&quot; the report, published on Feb. 9, warned. The latest intelligence assessment comes amid a series of increasingly dire warnings from Western leaders and defense officials about the threat emanating from Russia and Europe&apos;s current lack of preparedness. The DDIS in its report noted that fracturing among alliance members could present an opportunity for Moscow to capitalize, particularly if the United States is unwilling to protect its European allies. U.S. President Donald Trump sparked international outrage in February 2024 when he said he would urge Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, in a declaration indicating his disregard for the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle. Since being inaugurated, Trump has raised the ire of NATO allies by not ruling out using military force to gain control of Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark, as well as using economic coercion to force Canada to become a state. The DDIS report assessed that Russia may be able to wage war with a neighboring country within six month if it is able to reallocate military resources from Ukraine in the event of a frozen conflict or the end of the war. The report also concluded that Moscow poses a regional threat to Baltic states within two years, and a large-scale war with Europe in five years, presuming the U.S. does not intervene. The report acknowledges that the evolution of the Ukraine war will likely dictate Russia&apos;s future intention, adding that &quot;it is unlikely that Russia could sustain both the war in Ukraine and a simultaneous war with NATO.&quot; The report also does not account for an increase in NATO&apos;s military capabilities to match that of Moscow. On Dec. 12, the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump called for an even more radical increase, up to 5% of GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-find-opportunity-to-launch-large-scale-war-on-europe-within-5-years-danish-intelligence-warns/	2025-02-11T17:53:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1174515273.jpg
Ukraine will no longer create new brigades, official says	Ukraine will no longer form new military brigades, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa said in a television interview on Feb. 11. His comments come as Ukraine&apos;s army is set to reform its structure, introducing a corps system to replace its current brigade-level system. The government will now focus on strengthening existing brigades operating in combat zones by replenishing them, Palisa said. &quot;There is a detailed plan... In my opinion, the transition to a corps system is long overdue,&quot; Palisa said. &quot;This... is not just a matter of time, it will allow us to be more effective on the battlefield in terms of management and use resources more efficiently.&quot; Training will continue in existing brigades taking into account situations that arose in the past, Palisa added, possibly referring to recent military controversies. Ukrainian authorities have faced criticism for shortcomings in the military, including problems with the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov ordered an investigation on Dec. 16 into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers in the 211th Brigade by their commanders. The incidents involving the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade garnered widespread backlash. In one of the alleged cases of abuse, Senior Lieutenant Vladyslav Pastukh ordered subordinates to tie a victim to a wooden cross, where the soldier was immobilized for four hours. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed a military ombudsman to oversee conditions in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-no-longer-create-new-brigades-official-says/	2025-02-11T16:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247428702-1.jpg
Hungarian deputy FM arrives in Ukraine, demands explanation for 'slander campaign'	Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar criticized Ukrainian officials for a so-called &quot;slanderous campaign&quot; against Hungary in a visit to Kyiv on Feb. 11. Hungarian authorities have criticized Ukraine in the past, often repeating Kremlin propaganda. Budapest is regarded as Moscow&apos;s key ally in the European Union. Hungarian intelligence services have evidence of a &quot;slanderous campaign against Hungary&quot; backed by Ukraine, Magyar claimed in a Facebook post. &quot;The government will protect the country from all attempts at external influence, as there is nothing more important to us than the interests of Hungary,&quot; he said. Magyar did not cite evidence to support his allegations of a Ukrainian-backed slander campaign against Hungary. He said he was in Kyiv to ask Ukrainian authorities for &quot;explanations&quot; and to discuss Budapest&apos;s &quot;possible response.&quot; Magyar also accused Ukraine of restricting the rights of Hungarians living in Zakarpattia Oblast, a border region with Hungary. Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian government denies. Hungary feels it has been stabbed in the back after coordinating humanitarian support for Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Magyar said. The Hungarian government under Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked aid to Kyiv, delayed sanctions against Moscow, and downplayed Russian aggression against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s other key ally in Europe, Slovakia, has also recently accused Ukraine of backing a hostile campaign to disrupt the government. Both Hungary and Slovakia are heavily reliant on Russian gas, which Ukraine recently stopped transporting to Europea via its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-deputy-foreign-minister-arrives-in-ukraine-demands-explanation-for-slander/	2025-02-11T16:06:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-5_14_55-PM.png
US, UK, Australia sanction Russian cyber firm Zservers over ransomware attacks	The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia jointly imposed sanctions on the Russian cyber company Zservers for its role in ransomware attacks, the U.S. Treasury Department announced on Feb. 11. Zservers, a bulletproof hosting (BPH) services provider, supported the cybercrime group LockBit in perpetrating mass ransomware attacks, the department said. The sanctions against Zservers build upon penalties the three countries imposed last year against LockBit leaders. Lockbit, a prolific ransomware group, has carried out thousands of &#xA0;cyberattacks in the U.S. and Europe, resulting in losses of billions of euros. &quot;Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on U.S. and international critical infrastructure,&quot; said U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith. &quot;Today&apos;s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.&quot; The U.S. sanctions target Alexander Igorevich Mishin and Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov, both Russian nationals and adminstrators of Zservers. Their assets have been frozen and they are prohibited from financial transactions with institutions or individuals in the U.S. Financial institutions or other persons that do business with Zservers could also be exposed to sanctions. In addition to Mishin and Bolshakov, the U.K. named four other Zservers employees in its action against the company. &#xA0; &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin has built a corrupt mafia state&#x202F;driven by greed and ruthlessness,&quot; U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement. &quot;It is no surprise that the most unscrupulous extortionists and cyber-criminals run rampant from within his borders. This government will continue to work with partners to constrain the Kremlin and the impact of Russia&apos;s lawless cyber underworld.&quot; The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions against Russian hacker networks and cybercriminals. Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections. U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled willingness to step up sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Putin to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-uk-australia-sanction-russian-cyber-firm-zservers-over-ransomware-attacks/	2025-02-11T15:07:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197448662.jpg
Foreign Ministry denounces corruption allegations made by Tucker Carlson	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi denied corruption allegations by far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson in a social media post on Feb. 11. Carlson had earlier claimed that U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are resold on the black market, accusing the Ukrainian military of selling arms &quot;to drug cartels.&quot; Carlson provided no evidence to support his allegations. Tykhyi decried Carlson&apos;s claims in a post on X. &quot;This is a lie,&quot; the spokesperson said. Multiple U.S. inspections have never revealed the exploitation of military aid provided to Ukraine, Tykhyi added. &quot;Every piece of military equipment delivered to Ukraine is tracked. All supplied weapons are monitored by independent mechanisms.&quot; Tucker Carlson has previously repeated the Kremlin&apos;s talking points, and infamously interviewed both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Carlson for spreading Russian propaganda on Feb. 4. Carlson, a far-right media personality, is also a close ally of U.S. Presidend Donald Trump, whose return to the White House marks a shift in U.S. policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Other Trump allies have been scrutinized for their connections to Russia. Kash Patel, Trump&apos;s nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-denounces-tucker-carlsons-claims-of-corruption/	2025-02-11T14:18:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
Trump envoy who negotiated prisoner release secretly assigned to help end Ukraine war, NYT reports	Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, has been secretly tasked with helping negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 11, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes on the same day the White House announced that Witkoff successfully negotiated a deal with Russia to secure the release of imprisoned American teacher, Marc Fogel. Trump directed Witkoff weeks ago to expand his role beyond the Middle East and help play a part in the Ukraine peace process, multiple people told the NYT. While Trump has already appointed retired general Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, he believes Witkoff can successfully manage negotiations with the Russian side, sources said. Witkoff, a real estate billionaire, is a close personal friend of Trump. He flew to Russia himself to fly Fogel out of the country on his private jet &#x2014;&#xA0;the first time a senior U.S. official has been known to visit Moscow since 2021. According to the NYT&apos;s sources, Witkoff spoke directly with close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of his visit. Sources said Witkoff has also discussed Ukraine with contacts in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz called the deal to relase Fogel an &quot;exchange,&quot; but it is not clear what Russia is gaining in the agreement. Waltz also said the deal marked a sign of progress toward ending &quot;the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.&quot; Witkoff&apos;s authority regarding the Ukraine-Russia peace process is unclear, the NYT reported. Trump has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end the full-scale war, now nearing its third year. Kellogg, who is set to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, is reportedly preparing several options for a ceasefire deal to be presented to the White House. Trump claimed on Feb. 9 that he was in contact with Putin and had discussed ending the war in Ukraine with the Russian leader. U.S. and Russian officials have not confirmed or denied these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-envoy-who-negotiated-prisoner-release-secretly-assigned-to-help-end-ukraine-war-nyt-reports/	2025-02-11T13:54:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197640711.jpg
Russia releases imprisoned American teacher in 'exchange' deal	The Kremlin on Feb. 11 released Marc Fogel, a U.S. schoolteacher jailed in Russia on drug charges, in a deal negotiated with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport for possessing marijuana, which his family and supporters say was prescribed for medical use. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Russia released Fogel on Feb. 11 in an &quot;exchange,&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement. Witkoff flew Fogel out of the country on his own private plane, marking the first known visit of a U.S. official to Moscow since 2021. The details of the exchange deal with Russia have not been disclosed. The U.S. government officially classified Fogel as &quot;unjustly detained&quot; in December 2024, a classification that typically increases diplomatic efforts to secure a detainee&#x2019;s release. Fogel&apos;s family pushed for the designation after Fogel was excluded from a high-profile prisoner swap in August 2024 that secured the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan. In a statement following the release, Fogel&apos;s family thanked Trump for arranging the deal. &quot;We are beyond grateful, relieved and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,&quot; the statement read. While U.S. officials have not said what Russia is gaining in exchange for Fogel&apos;s release, Waltz said the deal was a sign that Trump was making progress in his attempts to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. &#xA0; &quot;President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the president&apos;s advisers negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,&quot; he said. The release of Fogel comes days after Trump claimed to have spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The Kremlin has not confirmed or denied the alleged conversations. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in December 2024, following Trump&apos;s election but before his inauguration, that Moscow would be open to participating in another prisoner exchange with the U.S. Russia has arrested many U.S. nationals since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine, with several Americans now serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. Under former President Joe Biden, the White House accused Moscow of orchestrating the arrests in hopes of future prisoner swaps for Russians held in the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-releases-imprisoned-american-teacher-in-exchange/	2025-02-11T12:53:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/prison.jpeg
Defense Ministry building testing ground for new AI-powered demining tech	The Defense Ministry is initiating the creation of a trial site to test new technologies used in demining, including those involving artificial intelligence, according to a statement published Feb. 11. Over 139,300 square kilometers of Ukrainian land are potentially contaminated with explosives from the full-scale war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion, according to the Economy Ministry. The project aims to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian demining, test innovations, and share experiences between Ukrainian and international partners, the Defense Ministry&apos;s statement read. &quot;The training ground, which is at the disposal of the Defense Ministry, can become a unique platform for joint research, testing, and training,&quot; Olha Drobot, representative of the Secretariat of the National Mine Action Authority, said. The latest technologies and their development can significantly accelerate the process of non-technical surveys of territories, improve the safety of deminers, and reduce risks to the civilian population, Drobot added. During the meeting, the participants also discussed new approaches to analyzing satellite and aerial imagery for mapping mined areas, using neural networks to automatically recognize minefields, and integrating modern artificial intelligence algorithms into safe demining. Ukraine remains the most mined country in the world. Over the past two years, Defense Ministry specialists have cleared 30,000 square kilometers of mines &#x2014; an area comparable to the size of Belgium or Moldova. Some 399 civilians have been killed, and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Multiple countries have been assisting Ukraine with demining efforts and providing training and equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-initiating-construction-of-testing-ground-for-new-demining-ai-powered-technologies/	2025-02-11T12:36:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: 'We'll swap one territory for another' — Zelensky on trade territory in potential peace talks with Russia	Key developments on Feb. 11: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to exchange territories if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, according to an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play &quot;an important part&quot; in future negotiations, Zelensky previously said. &quot;We will swap one territory for another,&quot; Zelensky told The Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. &quot;I don&apos;t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,&quot; he said. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&apos;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot; Ukrainian forces struck Russia&apos;s Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. Unverified videos posted to social media showed a large fire and search lights raking the sky reportedly in the vicinity of the refinery. &quot;The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),&quot; the General Staff said, adding that the facility supplies Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the Rosneft facility. The full extent of damage is being determined, it added. The attack was carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces, the military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, as well as other units, according to the statement. The confirmation of the attack on the Saratov oil refinery came after earlier reports of a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. The Russian Telegram news channel Shot also reported at least 11 explosions over Engels, a city lying across the Volga River from Saratov. The Russian strategic aviation airbase Engels-2, which has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian long-range strikes, lies in the vicinity. The U.S. plans to review the deployment of its troops around the world but is not going to send them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a press conference on Feb. 11. Hegseth&apos;s remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire is negotiated. &quot;We are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine,&quot; Hegseth told reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, during his visit to U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command headquarters. Hegseth added that Washington currently has no plans to reduce the U.S. contingent abroad but will review its deployment by President Donald Trump&apos;s strategic vision. The U.S. Defense Secretary also expressed hope for a swift peace agreement in Ukraine, which Trump has pledged to conclude. &quot;With hopefully a rapid peace deal in Ukraine, which the President (Donald Trump) is committed to delivering, we can then review force posture and encourage as you&apos;re going to see tomorrow (on Feb. 12) ... at the Ukraine contact group and the NATO ministerial, we&apos;re going to have straight talk with our friends,&quot; Hegseth said. Hegseth is expected to attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein summit, as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagon statement published Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to &quot;reiterate President Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,&quot; the statement read. However, this time, Hegseth is not likely to announce new military aid supplies, which was a regular occurrence during the Joe Biden administration, according to the Washington Post (WP). The Pentagon chief will not hold separate meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts but will rather be a &quot;listener&quot; at the Ramstein and at the meeting of NATO defense ministers on Feb. 13, an unnamed U.S. official told WP on condition of anonymity. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. In February, for the first time since the establishment of the Ramstein format, the meeting was convened by the U.K., not the U.S. North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea&apos;s Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia&apos;s war, confirming earlier warnings by the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-border incursion launched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia&apos;s technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support, Yonhap reported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region. Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for both Ukraine and Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade&apos;s statement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher. (The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade)Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically produced drones to front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes. It features a stationary installation with 12 radially arranged 213 mm caliber barrels and was adopted by the Soviet Navy in 1961.

As US vacates its leading role, Europe takes helm at Ramstein	The U.K. is set to gather the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Feb. 12, taking over the role the U.S. had assumed at the start of the all-out war. With U.S. President Donald Trump pulling his country out of established international agreements and formats, it&apos;s now up to European countries to fill in the gaps. &quot;Now, it will be mostly the Europeans who will determine the volume and range of weapons they are willing to provide to Ukraine,&quot; lawmaker Yehor Cherniev told the Kyiv Independent. Cherniev, who chairs Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said that European nations would likely focus on supplying their self-produced weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. &quot;The U.S. will continue to provide us with assistance, but the main burden will now be shifted to Europe,&quot; Cherniev said. &quot;The U.K.&apos;s presidency in the Ramstein format symbolizes the changes in support for Ukraine that will take place in 2025.&quot; The U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO said last week that Defense Secretary John Healey will chair the upcoming gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein meeting, in Brussels to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense priorities. Ukraine&apos;s pressing needs include bolstering the country&apos;s air defense, its deep-strike capabilities, and securing a steady ammunition supply, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to NATO Natalia Galibarenko said. &quot;We expect strong participation from our partners and look forward to hearing new pledges of military support,&quot; Galibarenko told the Kyiv Independent, saying that the three topics to be discussed at the Ramstein meeting are: &quot;the situation on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s security needs, and the pledges made by our partners and allies.&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will attend the meeting in Brussels but won&apos;t be announcing new military shipments to Ukraine. London&apos;s takeover of the meeting that gathers over 50 nations to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense needs holds &quot;a symbolic political meaning,&quot; according to lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliament&apos;s committee on foreign policy. He added that the meeting was to show that Europe would continue to support Kyiv no matter what happened in the U.S. Contrary to Cherniev&apos;s assessment, Merezhko believes that the U.S.&apos; will return to the driving seat after &quot;a transition period&quot; following Trump&apos;s return to power. &quot;I hope that they will return soon to their traditional leadership role,&quot; Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. The adjustment in the regular Ramstein meetings comes as Ukraine and Europe await Trump&apos;s next moves. Uncertainty looms over whether the Ramstein meeting would even exist under Trump. The U.S. president has claimed to have a plan to end the war in Ukraine and said he is in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 4, 2025. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Hegseth, who&apos;ll begin his European tour with the Ramstein meeting in Brussels, will stress &quot;Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible&quot; and Europe&apos;s boosting of security assistance to Kyiv, according to an official statement by the Pentagon. Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the American think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), agreed that it was already good news that Ramstein continues regardless of the change in the U.S. leadership and that Hegseth will still take part in it. Rather than waiting for Trump&apos;s presidency, Europe should have long taken over Washington&apos;s leadership role at Ramstein and suggested a rotation system of European chairs to lift the weight, Fix said. The Trump administration is demanding that European nations &quot;take over the security&quot; and assistance for Ukraine, but it should also be in Europe&apos;s interest to take the lead if it deems it as &quot;existential&quot; to its future, according to the expert. &quot;I think it was very comfortable for Europeans to rely on the U.S. leadership, and then there&apos;s also the question of who would lead Europe,&quot; Fix said, adding that &quot;it&apos;s always a competition between the U.K., France, Germany, and Poland.&quot; The downside, Fix explained, is that the U.S. is making less commitments because it won&apos;t be chairing the meeting, and the concern is how far London and Washington could push for more support for Ukraine &#x2014; and whether the latter would even try pressuring other countries. With Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, saying that the president would try to create leverage for both sides to kickstart potential peace negotiations, securing more weapons and resources has become ever more important for Kyiv. The past 25 rounds of Ramstein meetings, usually taking place at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, have helped Kyiv to receive over $145 billion in military aid from NATO countries, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. The first-ever meeting was held in April 2022 and chaired by then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was instrumental in gathering dozens of countries to discuss Ukraine&apos;s needs. The &quot;crucial platform for coordinating military aid&quot; has enabled Kyiv to receive basic resources from artillery shells, armored vehicles and tanks to modern air defense systems and U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in its January report. The February Ramstein meeting takes place at a crucial time when Ukrainian forces lose one settlement after another in the country&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast amid a critical manpower shortage. &quot;The only way a ceasefire can be achieved is through increasing leverage on Russia, and that includes continuous weapon deliveries and continuous provision of weapons to Ukraine by the Ramstein format,&quot; Fix said.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-main-burden-will-now-be-shifted-on-europe-uk-led-ramstein-meeting-to-kick-start-tomorrow-in-brussels/	2025-02-11T11:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193601148.jpg

A slipping CPI score signals Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts are stagnating	Another year has passed, and we are once again analyzing Ukraine&#x2019;s position in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). This year, Ukraine lost one point, now with 35 out of 100 possible points, ranking 105th out of 180 countries. While the loss of a single point falls within the margin of error, even this minimal change carries significance. This drop may signal stagnation in the fight against corruption, despite active legislative and governmental actions implemented last year. Ukraine&#x2019;s 2024 CPI score should serve as a wake-up call to the authorities, signaling that factors within the country are impeding progress in the fight against corruption. Overcoming these obstacles requires more than isolated declarative changes; systemic reforms in governance are essential. Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at the results of other EU-integration countries. The indicators of Georgia, Montenegro, and Turkey remained unchanged, while North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina lost two points each, and Serbia dropped by one point. Only two countries showed improvement: Moldova and Albania. The stagnation or decline observed in these countries is characteristic of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. Ukraine&#x2019;s result reflects a combination of both positive and negative developments in anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, it must be viewed through the lens of a country repelling a full-scale war imposed by a world superpower. Ukraine still outpaces Russia and Belarus, both of which lost four points each and are now ranked 154th (22 points) and 114th (33 points), respectively. This is particularly ironic, given Russia&#x2019;s previous narrative of Ukraine as a corrupt, failed state. In contrast, Ukraine has made steady progress over the past 11 years, gaining 10 points. Among Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors, only Moldova improved its score by one point, reaching 43. Romania&#x2019;s score remained the same at 46. Other countries in the region saw a decline: Poland (-1/53), Hungary (-1/41), and Slovakia (-5/49). Thus, not only Ukraine but also its neighbors showed lower results compared to last year. Despite Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war against Ukraine, Ukraine has managed to implement significant anti-corruption measures, contributing to previous improvements in the CPI. Some widely publicized events, such as notices of suspicion served to public officials or high-profile investigations, led to positive reforms. Effective collaboration between the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO), and the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) has resulted in numerous high-profile cases, including those involving former ministers, lawmakers, and the former Supreme Court chief. Over the past two years, 142 verdicts have been issued. The Verkhovna Rada expanded NABU&#x2019;s staff and strengthened SAPO&#x2019;s capacity, while launching the reform of the Accounting Chamber. Additionally, defense procurement legislation was updated, and the State Anti-Corruption Program was implemented. E-declarations and political party reporting were restored, and reforms to the Economic Security Bureau (ESBU) were initiated, along with steps to regulate plea bargaining. On the other hand, Ukraine has witnessed high-profile scandals that may have neutralized some of these achievements. Among these were the scandals involving the Ministry of Defense &#x2014; such as the eggs scandal and alleged bribery in clothing procurement for the military. Public outrage was also sparked by alleged corruption involving former Minister Vasyl Lozynskyi and interference in a tender for the reconstruction of the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital. Children walk past the offices of NABU, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Many of the scandals that caused public uproar toward the end of 2024 were not included in the CPI due to methodological reasons. However, these events reinforce negative trends in public perception of corruption and may continue to impact future results. These include scandals involving the Medical and Social Expert Commissions (MSEC), reports in Western media about Kyrylo Tymoshenko&#x2019;s role in reconstruction, and obstacles faced by a French entrepreneur in the recovery of Hostomel. The late 2024 conflict between the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Ministry of Defense (MoD) over the dismissal of the DPA head, along with the procurement of low-quality mines, further fueled public discontent. These cases may be considered in the CPI for 2025, alongside positive developments such as the launch of the Accounting Chamber reform, the announcement of an external audit for NABU, and the resumption of large-scale privatization (e.g., the sale of AEROC, formerly Russia-affiliated assets). As in previous years, the CPI scores are based on eight studies covering the period from February 2021 to September 2024. In three of these studies, Ukraine&#x2019;s score improved, while in five studies, it dropped by two to six points. Notably, in 2024, Transparency International reviewed its methodology, which means fluctuations of +/- 1 point are considered within the margin of error and reflect technical changes. However, even a slight drop in points should be treated as an early warning. Ukraine&#x2019;s 2024 CPI score suggests that progress in the fight against corruption has largely been driven by commitments made to international partners. European integration remains the key driver of reforms in Ukraine. Nevertheless, delays, a lack of political will, and attempts to preserve undue influence have hindered progress. It is crucial to remember that Ukraine is in the midst of one of the most brutal wars since World War II &#x2014; a war waged by Russia to spread autocracy, subjugate Ukrainians, and destroy our democracy. In this context, unity and support for European integration are vital. The authorities must implement necessary reforms efficiently and on time, without pushing through initiatives that may risk corruption or undermine anti-corruption efforts. Negative reactions from society should not serve as an excuse for slowing down legislative progress. Compliance with international best practices should be the default aspiration for Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine&#x2019;s position in this year&#x2019;s CPI serves as a call to action for the authorities. Delays, political maneuvering, and attempts to avoid essential changes have impacted the country&#x2019;s progress. We must not lose the gains made over the past decade. Even in the face of war and challenging circumstances, Ukraine must strive to improve, as this is the only path to preserving our statehood and securing our future.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 13	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 13 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 3&#x2013;Feb. 9, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to review High Administrative Court bill, but passage uncertain Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is set to review bill #12368-1, which proposes the establishment of the High Administrative Court, during the first plenary week of its new session. The bill, authored by Serhiy Vlasenko from the Batkivshchyna faction, faces an uphill battle, as it does not align with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) memorandum requirements and is unlikely to secure enough support for passage. Moreover, the Committee hasn&#x2019;t made a decision regarding this draft law yet. As previously reported, this version of the bill assigns jurisdiction over cases related to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) competitions and audits to the Kyiv City District Administrative Court (KMOAC). Additionally, it proposes creating a separate Kyiv City Administrative Court of Appeal for appeals &#x2014; an approach that diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the IMF&#x2019;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Meanwhile, another IMF structural benchmark, the repeal of the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; on pre-trial investigation deadlines, remains absent from the legislative agenda &#x2014; despite its original December 2024 deadline. The session&#x2019;s procedural uncertainty was further highlighted on Feb. 4, when lawmakers failed to secure enough votes to approve the 2025 parliamentary legislative plan and session agenda. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to debate ARMA reform bills This week, Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada will consider several bills aimed at reforming the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA). The agenda includes the government-backed draft law #12374, along with two alternative proposals &#x2014; draft law #12374-1, sponsored by MP Tkachenko, and draft law #12374-2, introduced by MP Oleksii Movchan. The legislative amendments is a key requirement under the Ukraine Facility plan, with a Q1 2025 deadline. The reform package seeks to enhance the appointment process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, ensuring an independent selection process, as well as introducing external audits and performance evaluations to improve accountability. Zelensky backs completion of Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant reactors Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly endorsed the completion of the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant expansion project, calling it a cornerstone of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy independence and regional stability. &#x201C;The completion of this project is key to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy independence and the region&#x2019;s energy security. It is important that Ukrainian lawmakers support this initiative,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a Feb. 4 video address. However, MPs and anti-corruption NGOs raise concerns over the financial feasibility of the project. Investigative outlet Nashi Groshi reported that Ukraine is expected to pay $1.1 billion to acquire old Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria, with additional construction and installation costs still undetermined. Six years ago, the project&#x2019;s estimated cost was Hr 80 billion ($2 billion at the time), but state nuclear operator Energoatom has now launched a tender for a revised cost assessment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-13/	2025-02-11T10:23:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-170977739.jpg
Ukrainian drones destroy Russian Smerch-2 rocket launcher in Donetsk Oblast	Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for both Ukraine and Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade&#x2019;s statement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher. (The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade)Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically produced drones to front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes. It features a stationary installation with 12 radially arranged 213 mm caliber barrels and was adopted by the Soviet Navy in 1961.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-destroy-russian-smerch-2-rocket-launcher-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-11T09:45:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-19_09_40.png
London-based digital bank Revolut officially launches in Ukraine	British fintech company Revolut officially launched its services in Ukraine after a beta testing phase, introducing a special Clear Sky debit card in Ukraine&apos;s national blue and yellow colors, the company announced on its website on Feb.11. Ukrainian residents can set up a European Revolut account and receive access to a range of services, such as instant, free transfers between app users, said the company. Revolut has been supporting Ukrainians since Russia&apos;s invasion began, offering refugees from Ukraine free access to its services, including money transfers and currency exchange, and temporarily waiving the usual requirement for proof of European residency. According to the company, over 700,000 Ukrainians residing in the U.K. and Europe already use Revolut services. Since 2022, people have sent more than 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) to Ukraine through Revolut, mainly from Germany, the U.K., Ireland, Poland, and the Netherlands. &#x201C;I am immensely proud of Revolut&#x2019;s continuous support for Ukraine. A record number of Ukrainians have joined our waiting list to be among the first to get their Revolut account,&#x201D; said Vlad Yatsenko, &#x441;o-founder and CTO of Revolut, adding that more Revolut products would be available in Ukraine soon. Ukrainian customers will be able to order virtual and physical debit cards, including the special Clear Sky VISA debit card free of charge. Users in the U.K. and Europe can get this card by donating at least five euros ($5.17) to get the card unlocked. All donations will go to the UN Refugee Agency which supports Ukrainian war refugees. Revolut announced that since Russia&apos;s invasion began, it has raised over 10 million pounds ($12.4 million) for the Red Cross Ukraine, including a 1.5 million pound ($1.9 million) company donation. Revolut was co-founded by Ukrainian Vlad Yatsenko and Russian Nikolai Storonsky, who renounced his citizenship due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company has also suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/london-based-digital-bank-revolut-officially-launches-in-ukraine/	2025-02-11T08:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-6_14_44-PM.png
US Treasury Secretary to visit Ukraine this week for talks on critical minerals deal, Bloomberg reports	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine this week to discuss a potential deal between Kyiv and Washington on critical minerals, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11, citing undisclosed sources. In recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Ukraine with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for continued support from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-treasury-secretary-to-visit-ukraine-this-week-for-talks-on-critical-minerals-deal-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-11T08:02:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197389153.jpg
Ukraine can help dismantle Russia’s influence in the Middle East	The fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has dealt a significant blow to Russia&#x2019;s ambitions in the Middle East. Yet Russia still retains influence across the region through trade, diplomacy, and military ties. Even now, Moscow maintains a presence in Syria, making it imperative for the West to capitalize on Russia&#x2019;s setback there and work to reduce its influence across the region. One way to achieve this is by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s efforts to build stronger ties in the Middle East. First, Ukraine can assist in rebuilding Syria, an effort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed willingness to undertake. While much attention is given to the future of Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria, its commercial ties to the country are equally important. The U.S. can support Ukrainian trade with Syria, starting with food. Until recently, Russia was the largest supplier of wheat to Syria &#x2014; grain largely stolen from Ukraine. However, with the fall of Assad&#x2019;s regime, these shipments have been suspended, creating an ideal opening for Kyiv. Wheat could serve as a starting point for expanded trade, alongside the development of diplomatic, cultural, and potentially military ties between the two nations. Ukrainians have already taken initial steps to build diplomatic relations with Syria, and a strengthened Ukrainian presence there could limit Russia&#x2019;s options beyond its military bases, should it manage to retain them. Second, Ukraine can assist the West in countering Russian narratives across the Middle East and Africa. Moscow&#x2019;s influence in these regions has been significant, helping explain why some Middle Eastern partners have not supported Western efforts to isolate Russia. Russian military vehicles enter the Khmeimim Air Base in Jabla, Syria, on Dec. 15, 2024. (Izzettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images)Ukrainians themselves acknowledge their failure to invest in the region, allowing Russian propaganda to take root. In private conversations, Ukrainian officials have admitted to this misstep, but they are now taking steps to change it, including opening more embassies across the Middle East and Africa. The West can support Ukraine in these efforts, helping the region understand Ukraine&#x2019;s position. Building meaningful relationships in the Middle East has proven challenging for Ukraine, and here the West can play a crucial role. Kyiv lacks sufficient diplomats to staff its embassies, and the West can help build Ukraine&#x2019;s diplomatic capacity. Moreover, Ukrainians would benefit from Western guidance in navigating the region&#x2019;s complex cultural landscape to craft more effective messaging. Kyiv urgently needs personnel capable of engaging with the region. In addition to diplomatic and cultural training, Ukrainians could collaborate with Western governments to establish a more prominent media presence as a counterbalance to outlets like RT Arabic and Sputnik. Lastly, Ukraine can share its experience with Iran as part of its increased engagement with the Middle East, assisting Arab partners (and Israel) in countering Iranian influence. After Russia&#x2019;s use of Iranian drones in Ukraine and Iran&#x2019;s supply of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, Ukraine has gained valuable insights into dealing with Iran. These lessons could benefit audiences in the region, and the West can help shape this engagement, highlighting the similarities between Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia and Middle Eastern efforts to push back against Iran&#x2019;s malign activities. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the interconnectedness of the Middle East and European theaters. Western support for Ukraine can help Kyiv secure new revenues to fund its fight against Russia, as well as bolster its credibility in the Muslim world. A greater Ukrainian presence in the Middle East will offer multiple benefits for the West, contributing to a shift in the regional power balance in its favor and countering Russia&#x2019;s influence. Ukrainians understand that victory over Russia requires expanding their influence beyond Europe. The West has every reason to empower them in this effort in the Middle East.

Ukraine could trade territory in potential peace talks with Russia, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to exchange territories if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, according to an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play &quot;an important part&quot; in future negotiations, Zelensky previously said. &quot;We will swap one territory for another,&quot; Zelensky told The Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. &quot;I don&apos;t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-exchange-territories-in-case-trump-manages-to-get-ukraine-russia-to-negotiating-table/	2025-02-11T07:27:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Chinese refiners offered discounted Russian oil as US sanctions deter buyers, Bloomberg reports	Chinese refiners are being offered Russian ESPO crude at discounted prices as rising concerns over U.S. sanctions create logistical and administrative challenges, deterring buyers, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 11. In one of his final moves in office, U.S. President Joe Biden imposed sanctions on Russia on Jan. 10, targeting Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegaz, over 180 oil tankers transporting crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, and insurance companies involved in oil logistics. Following the sanctions and rising oil prices, China temporarily halted purchases of Russian crude, despite being one of Russia&#x2019;s largest oil buyers in 2024. With the new U.S. sanctions in place, the cost of delivering Russian oil to China surged fivefold, from $1.5 million in early January to $7 million by the end of the month. This spike increased fuel and freight costs for Chinese buyers, prompting them to seek alternative suppliers in the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, Bloomberg reported. ESPO is a higher-quality Russian crude than Urals and is typically in high demand in Asian markets, where it usually trades at a premium, according to Bloomberg. Supplies of ESPO crude from the Far Eastern port of Kozmino, transported on non-sanctioned tankers and loaded in March, are selling at a $2&#x2013;$3 per barrel premium to Brent. In January, the premium for shipments under the same conditions exceeded $5. Oil delivered on sanctioned tankers is being offered at an even steeper discount. However, China&#x2019;s state-owned refiners have so far refused to sign ESPO supply contracts for February as they weigh the risks and potential consequences. Some buyers and sellers are considering using lesser-known oil terminals or unloading shipments outside Shandong province before transferring them to another tanker to keep ESPO trading. However, traders told Bloomberg this would reduce government oversight while driving up costs that most refineries cannot afford. China has strengthened economic ties with Russia since the start of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though Beijing has denied accusations of directly supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Russia&#x2019;s fossil fuel industry remains the primary economic driver of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Mounting economic pressure has nonetheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale back their dealings with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-refiners-offered-discounted-russian-oil-as-us-sanctions-deter-buyers-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-11T07:19:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Ukraine secures $58 million grant from Japan for reconstruction	The Ukrainian government approved a draft agreement with Japan to secure an 8.8 billion yen ($58 million) grant for reconstruction projects, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Feb. 11. The funds will be provided through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Shmyhal expressed gratitude for Japan&apos;s &quot;consistent, unwavering support&quot; and emphasized that Ukraine continues to work with partners to secure reconstruction resources. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Tokyo has also supported Ukraine&apos;s energy sector, which has suffered severe damage from Russian attacks, and has provided expertise on nuclear safety. In December 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Japan would allocate $3 billion to Ukraine as part of the G7 loan covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets. The World Bank estimated in February 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction may cost up to $486 billion over the next decade.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-58-million-grant-from-japan-for-rebuilding-projects-pm-shmyhal-says/	2025-02-11T06:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
US envoy in Moscow holds talks with Russian deputy FM	Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met with U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy in Moscow on Feb. 11, Russian state media outlet TASS reported without providing details on the content of the discussions. Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova later said the meeting focused on &quot;the activities of foreign institutions.&quot; According to Rybakov, diplomatic contacts between Russia and the U.S. have been kept to an absolute minimum in 2024. Relations between Moscow and Washington have sharply deteriorated since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both the Russian Embassy in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow continue to operate in limited capacities. U.S. consular services in Russia have been largely suspended since 2021 due to Moscow&apos;s restrictions on diplomatic staffing. The meeting comes as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 9 that the U.S. had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to provide details. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been in contact but did not specify whether their discussions occurred before or after his inauguration. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, American political analyst Alexandra Filippenko pointed out that Lynne and Rybakov&apos;s talks mark an unusually high-level meeting. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that the American side is making (an effort to restore ties), but the Russian side is showing an increased level of communication,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ryabkov-meets-us-envoy/	2025-02-11T06:23:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1251952759.jpg
Parliament approves controversial purchase of Russian nuclear reactors from Bulgaria	Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted in favor of buying two Russian-made reactors from Bulgaria for the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on Feb. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the lawmakers last week to approve the project, calling it a &quot;key to energy independence.&quot; Bulgaria has offered to sell its unused 15-year-old VVER-1000 reactors and other equipment for units 3 and 4 of the western Ukrainian nuclear power plant as Ukraine faces regular Russian attacks against its energy grid. Some lawmakers have criticized the deal, arguing that the reactors are obsolete and expensive. The parliament has long struggled to pass the law, prompting Bulgaria to extend the deadline for concluding the deal until March. The price of the two reactors was set at $600 million, said lawmaker Andrii Zhupanyn. Nuclear power is key in sustaining Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, covering more than half of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. Russian missile and drone attacks have dealt devastating damage to Ukraine&apos;s thermal and hydroelectric generating capacity, necessitating regular emergency shutdowns. The Khmelnytskyi plant, one of the three remaining operational nuclear stations in Ukraine-held territories, is being expanded to offset the loss of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, currently under Russian occupation. The news comes as Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, who has advocated for purchasing Russian-made reactors, is under mounting political pressure. Opposition lawmakers accused the minister of &quot;systemic corruption in the energy sector,&quot; &quot;failure to protect parts of the energy infrastructure,&quot; and &quot;lies and manipulations&quot; and called for his dismissal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-approves-controversial-purchase-of-russian-nuclear-reactors-from-bulgaria/	2025-02-11T05:24:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1645854809.jpg
Ukraine’s army is reforming its structure. Will it help the fight against Russia?	As Ukraine nears the fourth year of full-scale war with Russia, it is launching a major army reform aimed at improving its efficiency and organization on the battlefield. &quot;We need the corps system,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 3, adding: &quot;Today we discussed approaches to the appointment of corps commanders: these should be the best-trained, most promising officers with combat experience and modern thinking.&quot; &quot;The army must be modern.&quot; The Ukrainian army currently operates largely under a brigade-level system. According to Zelensky, there are more than 100 brigades, each of which is subordinated to operational-tactical groups (OTU), which are subject to operational-strategic command (OSUV), and operational commands (OK). According to experts speaking to the Kyiv Independent, this has created an unwieldy management system that leads to poor coordination, as each OTU or OSUV may have dozens of brigades under its command. John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Kyiv Independent that OTUs and OSUVs are temporary bodies, so their commanders do not know their brigades as well as a permanent corps commander would. A related problem is that battalions from one brigade are often scattered across different parts of the front and attached to other brigades, undermining unit cohesion, he added. Hardie also said micromanagement is another drawback of this system, as there have been cases of interfering commanders without knowledge of a complete or up-to-date picture of the situation on the ground. Drawing on the experience of NATO partners, Ukraine plans to implement a corps system instead of a brigade one, seeking to improve cohesion. A corps is an army formation consists of several brigades rather than dozens, and includes various branches of the forces and support units. The upcoming reform will add the corps level to the army structure, which will be organizationally above the brigades. The Ukrainian military command plans to create 20 corps, Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net reported, citing undisclosed sources. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army Major-General said a corps usually has only three to seven brigades at its disposal, which allows commanders to better focus on their troops, and distributes the management load more efficiently. &quot;(The transition to the corps) will allow them just to get their arms around the brigades, have some brigades planning for operations, some brigades conducting operations, some brigades resting from operations,&quot; Ryan said. A Ukrainian soldier in his fighting position near Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Nov. 17, 2024.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;It will allow for more efficient employment of land combat forces and a more efficient link between the tactical and General Staff,&quot; he added. Ryan said the transition to the corps system is also part of the Ukrainian army&apos;s adaptation to NATO standards and separation from its Soviet heritage. Yet, the newly created corps could be different from those deployed by the U.K. and the U.S. during the Cold War, as there have been &quot;profound changes&quot; in technology since 1990s, he said. &quot;The West should look on with some interest because the reality is, besides the Americans, most Western military organizations are brigade-centric organizations,&quot; Ryan said. There are currently five corps in the Ukrainian Armed Forces &#x2014; the 9th, 10th, and 11th corps of the Ground Forces, the Rapid Reaction Corps in the Air Assault Forces, and the Marine Corps in the Navy. &quot;Ukraine currently has some army corps, but they&apos;re basically corps in name only. Their units are often scattered to different parts of the front line, and the corps lack many corps-echelon support units,&quot; Hardie said. &quot;Even in instances where multiple units from a corps have operated alongside one another, such as during the 2023 counteroffensive, the corps commanders didn&apos;t exercise command and control, and at any rate, the units lacked sufficient cohesion to function together as corps,&quot; Hardie added. Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent that the past performance of existing corps should be a cause for concern. Damaged cars and buildings in Kurakhove, near the front line in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;In 2023, the 9th and 10th corps failed in the offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In 2024, the 7th corps surrendered Vuhledar and then Kurakhove,&quot; he said. &quot;In 2025, we still believe that the corps (system) is a panacea for all diseases.&quot; According to Kevliuk, the change to a corps system won&apos;t address other fundamental issues with Ukraine&apos;s army, not least its critical manpower shortage, and struggles to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. He added that corps commands are likely to be formed by those who &quot;failed to manage the OTUs.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to change the command system. The main problem is to get commanders to change their management style,&quot; Kevliuk said, adding: &quot;Other problems are to make the headquarters interact horizontally and to provide the technical equipment to command.&quot; &quot;At best, the transition will have no impact. But we should expect a deterioration in the command (of the units),&quot; he concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-army-switching-to-corps-system-how-will-it-change-situation-on-battlefield/	2025-02-11T04:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190892824.jpg
With cuts looming, it's time to reform Ukraine’s humanitarian aid system	Since Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the international community has sent nearly $11 billion in humanitarian aid, with billions more from individuals, charities, and Ukrainians. The UN recently announced a new $3.3 billion appeal for 2025. Yet, despite this support, key players in humanitarian aid &#x2014; state donors, UN agencies, and International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs) &#x2014; have missed a crucial chance to reform a broken, top-heavy system. This failure is especially concerning as Ukraine faces potential cuts to international aid in the coming months and years. This is the conclusion of the latest &#x201C;Annual Localization Survey,&#x201D; conducted by Refugees International and the Ukrainian NGO East SoS. The survey, which involved 50 interviews with those who control or direct the bulk of international humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, found that UN agencies and INGOs still monopolize funding, leadership, and policy influence. Despite widespread research showing that locally led humanitarian responses are more cost-effective (between 15.5%-32%, depending on the program), efficient, and better positioned to serve people in need amid donor cuts, international organizations continue to dominate. According to FTS, less than 1% of the $11 billion in humanitarian aid sent between 2022 and 2024 went directly to Ukrainian NGOs. Unsurprisingly, cash and voucher programs, the largest type of international humanitarian intervention in Ukraine, are almost entirely managed by UN agencies and INGOs. Only 3.4% of more than $2.1 billion has been handled end-to-end by Ukrainian NGOs. Direct funding to local groups from donors is widely recognized as crucial for improving humanitarian responses. It avoids the more costly, circuitous use of international intermediaries and empowers those who know the terrain best. Additionally, it strengthens the resilience and durability of local organizations by providing them with more funding to cover overhead costs and improve long-term capacity, helping ensure they will endure after international aid declines. Even when Ukrainian organizations receive funding and in-kind goods through UN agencies and INGOs as subcontractors &#x2014; or &#x201C;implementing partners&#x201D; &#x2014; the survey found that international actors retain the majority of funding despite Ukrainian partners doing most of the actual service delivery. This is particularly true along the extensive front line. International agencies also control the design and implementation of many aid programs, even though Ukrainian responders have made clear that this impedes their empowerment and service delivery. Donors, including European states and the United States, claim they are working to empower Ukrainian organizations by funding them directly. However, progress has been hindered by two factors that no longer hold up. People receive humanitarian aid in Hostomel, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, on April 6, 2022, after it was liberated from Russian occupation amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)People receive humanitarian aid provided by volunteers in Kherson, Ukraine, on June 11, 2023, amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.

This argument may have made sense in the early stages of the response, when many Ukrainian NGOs transitioned to humanitarian action from political and civil society programs. But as the response approaches its fourth year, data shows that a robust ecosystem of Ukrainian NGOs is handling large grants and complex requirements, well beyond the few that currently receive direct funding from major donors. Second, the perception of corruption risks among Ukrainian NGOs no longer stands up to scrutiny. Across 32 donors, INGOs, and UN agencies surveyed, which have completed hundreds of audits, no respondent pointed to any substantial, confirmed cases of corruption by Ukrainian partners. While some noted minor program irregularities, such as misunderstandings regarding budget lines, the finding is significant given the high perception of corruption in other sectors in Ukraine. Together with the cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability gains, donors should increase their support for Ukrainian responders by decisively shifting power and resources to them in 2025. This move is even more critical to mitigate the negative effects of any future cuts. The largest donors to the Ukraine response have an opportunity to embrace this improved approach, but their willingness to do so remains unclear. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has frozen most foreign aid for a 90-day review and is trying to dismantle the main U.S. aid agency. Some advocates are holding out hope, however, that Trump will eventually shift resources directly to local responders, citing the position of a leading pro-Trump think tank before the election. Regardless of what happens in the U.S., European Union states, which contribute the most humanitarian aid to Ukraine, can do much more to get funding flowing directly to Ukrainians. For instance, one leading EU state agency that cited national rules against direct funding to Ukrainian NGOs was surprised to learn from the authors that a separate agency within the same government was providing humanitarian funding directly to one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest NGOs. The EU&#x2019;s European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) arm has similarly maintained that it cannot provide funding to non-European NGOs due to an EU regulation. However, the regulation also states that an NGO&#x2019;s headquarters can be in the recipient country, which applies to Ukraine and many other countries. Ukrainian humanitarian NGOs are rapidly building coordination and oversight mechanisms, solidarity networks, and operational partnerships to take over as aid budgets shrink and international actors reduce their role. Donors, UN agencies, and INGOs are encouraging these efforts. But with drastic budget cuts looming, more than just encouragement and pilot projects are needed. Seizing this moment will have lasting implications, not only in Ukraine but for many other humanitarian emergencies around the world that are no less deserving or ready.

Russia records worst-ever ranking in key corruption index	Russia ranked 154th out of 180 countries in Transparency International&apos;s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index, marking its worst performance in the index&apos;s history, the organization reported on Feb. 11. &quot;In order for autocratic regimes to secure power, they dismantle critical checks and balances &#x2014; allowing corruption to run rampant,&quot; Transparency International said in the report. Russia was given a score of 22 points, with a lower number of points indicating higher corruption perceptions. In 2023, Transparency International placed Russia 141st with a score of 26 points. The organization highlighted that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has further entrenched authoritarianism, with the Kremlin suppressing dissent, redirecting resources to its military agenda, and eliminating independent voices. Ukraine ranked 105th with 35 points, moving up one spot from 2023 relative to other countries but losing one point. Kyiv saw a three-point increase between 2022 and 2023. &quot;Despite the Russian invasion, Ukraine is making strides in judicial independence and high-level corruption prosecutions,&quot; Transparency International said. After the EuroMaidan Revolution ousted pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, Ukraine launched an extensive anti-corruption campaign. Observers warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion presents an increasingly significant challenge to Ukraine&apos;s anti-graft reforms. Andrii Borovik, the executive director of Transparency International Ukraine, noted that while a one-point drop is not necessarily a sign of decline, it suggests stagnation and warns authorities that more reforms are needed. Tackling corruption is one of the main conditions for Ukraine&apos;s integration into Western political structures, namely the EU. Among the reforms recommended by Brussels in 2022 were changes to Ukraine&apos;s anti-corruption bodies, judiciary reforms, legislation against money laundering, and more. Among other countries in the region, Moldova improved its performance by reaching 43 points, ranking 76th, while Albania climbed five points to 80th place with 42 points. The European Union&apos;s average score dropped by two points this year to 62. Denmark topped the index for the seventh consecutive year with a score of 90, followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-records-worst-ever-ranking-in-corruption-perceptions-index-report-shows/	2025-02-11T04:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-835906084.jpg
North Korea has sent 200 long-range artillery guns to Russia, Seoul says	North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea&apos;s Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia&apos;s war, confirming earlier warnings by the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-border incursion launched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia&apos;s technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support, Yonhap reported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv&#x2019;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-sends-200-long-range-artillery-units-to-russia-seoul-says/	2025-02-11T03:58:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1911909732.jpg
US to consult allies on Ukraine peace plan, seeks Europe's arms purchases for Kyiv, media report	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has paused the development of a Ukraine peace plan to hold consultations with European allies, The Telegraph reported on Feb. 10, citing undisclosed sources. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, reportedly assured European diplomats that NATO allies would be consulted before finalizing any proposal. He also promised to engage with European heads of state on the issue, according to the outlet. The Trump administration is also exploring ways to continue arming Ukraine without significantly increasing U.S. spending, according to Reuters. One approach reportedly under discussion is encouraging European allies to purchase more American weapons for Kyiv. U.S. officials, including Kellogg, are expected to raise this issue during the Munich Security Conference this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation at the conference, where he is expected to meet with U.S. officials. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Kellogg will represent the Trump administration. While Bloomberg previously reported that Trump&apos;s team might unveil a peace plan in Munich, Kellogg denied this on Feb. 6. Ukraine is preparing to host Kellogg on Feb. 20 following the conference, according to sources cited by RBC-Ukraine. The Munich Security Conference comes at a critical moment for Kyiv, as Ukraine seeks to establish working relations with the new U.S. administration, which has taken a different approach to the war than its predecessor. Kellogg has described a &quot;near-term&quot; resolution as achievable within 100 days of the inauguration, calling it his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution within that timeframe.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-consult-allies-on-ukraine-peace-plan-seeks-european-weapons-purchases-media-reports/	2025-02-11T03:29:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
6 injured in Russian airstrike on Kharkiv Oblast village, including child	Russia launched an airstrike against the village of Zolochiv in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 11, injuring at least six people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A 12-year-old boy was among the injured. Three of the victims have been hospitalized, while the others were provided medical assistance on the spot, the governor said. Russian forces reportedly struck the town with guided aerial bombs at around 11:27 a.m. local time, hitting a house. The full extent of damage and casualties is being determined. Zolochiv, with a pre-war population of 7,700, lies around 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the Ukraine-Russia border and some 35 kilometers (20 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv. Kharkiv Oblast in Ukraine&apos;s northeast is a regular target of Russian missile, drone, and glide bomb attacks from across the border or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-injured-in-russian-airstrike-on-kharkiv-oblast-town/	2025-02-11T03:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1513217350.jpg
Russia concerned with weakening sway over its allies amid Western pressure, FT reports	Russian officials are concerned that the Western sanctions are undermining Russia&apos;s economic influence over countries in its close neighborhood and the Global South, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 10, citing a leaked government report. Moscow is reportedly attempting to restore its position and access to global trade by placing itself at the center of a Eurasian trade bloc that would rival the economic influence of the U.S., EU, and China. The news underscores the impact of Western sanctions on Russia and its mounting economic challenges connected to the nearly three years of the full-scale war against Ukraine. The planned initiative aims to connect Russia with the Global South through shared access to raw materials, financial and transportation links, and a unified economic policy, including a separate sanctions framework, according to the news outlet. Russia reportedly sees the project as a long-term strategy that will continue regardless of the outcome of negotiations on the war in Ukraine. The report acknowledges significant obstacles. Western pressure has hindered Moscow&apos;s efforts to integrate nations in its neighborhood, as Central Asian countries have sought to align with global markets that bypass Russia. The report also notes that Western governments have used a combination of threats and incentives to ensure compliance with sanctions. Russia&apos;s allies have exploited the situation by pushing Russian businesses out of their jurisdictions, taking control of trade flows, and demanding additional commissions to offset the risks of sanctions violations. Belarus is cited as a success story for Moscow, while Kazakhstan has distanced itself by refusing to recognize Russia&apos;s territorial claims in Ukraine and demonstrating compliance with Western sanctions. Kyrgyzstan, by contrast, has become a key route for sanctions evasion. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU has adopted 15 sanctions packages targeting Moscow&apos;s economy, while the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland have imposed similar measures to curb Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-reassert-global-trade-position-with-new-eurasian-bloc-ft-reports/	2025-02-11T02:32:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251592140.jpg
3 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 11. Overnight, Russia launched 124 Shahed-type combat and decoy drones, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones across 11 oblasts, while 64 others were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. Moscow&apos;s forces also launched up to 19 cruise, ballistic, and guided missiles from ground- and sea-based platforms, targeting gas production facilities, the report said. As a result of a missile strike on Poltava Oblast, Naftogaz facilities were damaged, and nine settlements in the Myrhorod district were left without a gas supply. Governor Filip Pronin reported no casualties. Two people were killed and six injured during Russian attacks in Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Six high-rise buildings and 12 houses were reportedly damaged. Russian forces launched heavy drone and artillery attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, injuring at least four people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Two women aged 18 and 44 were injured in the Russian shelling of Nikopol on the evening of Feb. 10, while a 67-year-old man and a 78-year-old woman were injured in Marhanets. Dozens of houses, high-rise buildings, and other buildings were damaged across the region. In Cherkasy Oblast, two men were injured by drone debris after Ukrainian air defenses shot down 17 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, Governor Ihor Taburets said. The victims have been hospitalized and are in a condition of moderate severity, according to the governor. Russian attacks injured three people in Donetsk Oblast over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin said, reporting victims in Pokrovsk, Kostiantynivka, and Leontovychi. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was killed and two others were injured in Russian strikes against the Zaporizhzhia and Polohy districts, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone debris started a fire at a non-residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi city district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. A kindergarten, &#xA0;two school buildings, and other buildings were damaged elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast, but no casualties were reported, according to the regional military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-125/	2025-02-11T01:19:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-11_08-41-00.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russia's Saratov oil refinery, military confirms	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian forces struck Russia&apos;s Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. &quot;The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),&quot; the General Staff said, adding that the facility supplies Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. This comes as a confirmation of earlier reports of a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the facility. The full extent of damage is being determined.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russias-saratov-oil-refinery-military-confirms/	2025-02-11T00:56:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Saratov-Feb-11.jpeg
Trump signs 25% tariff on steel, aluminum imports; Ukraine's economy to feel the effect	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 10 imposing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions, according to the White House. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture. &quot;In recent years, we have made every effort to ensure that Ukrainian steel remains outside the 25% tariff limit in the U.S.,&quot; said First Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Development Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, implying that these efforts have been unsuccessful. Svyrydenko added that the decision to impose tariffs will naturally affect Ukraine&apos;s steel industry. Trump defended the tariffs as a way to simplify duties on metals and hinted at retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on American goods. The European Commission previously vowed to &quot;react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers, and consumers from unjustified measures.&quot; The dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion of European exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting tariffs and replacing them with a quota system while the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s new tariffs threaten to reignite the trade conflict. The European Commission argued that such restrictions would disrupt the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S., raising costs and harming trade between both regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-signs-executive-order-imposing-25-tariffs-on-all-steel-aluminum-imports/	2025-02-11T00:49:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Russia strikes Ukraine's energy grid, forcing emergency shutdowns	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an aerial strike against Ukraine&apos;s power grid overnight on Feb. 11, forcing the country&apos;s energy operator to implement emergency power outages, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The attack, which included strikes on gas infrastructure overnight and continued into the morning, has further strained Ukraine&apos;s energy grid. &quot;At night, Russia attacked gas infrastructure. As of this morning, the energy sector is still under attack,&quot; Halushchenko said. Russian forces reportedly launched cruise missiles from the Black Sea overnight, triggering air alerts in Kyiv and several oblasts. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since the start of its full-scale invasion, aiming to disrupt power supplies and weaken civilian morale.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-imposes-power-outages-after-russian-attack-on-energy-system-gas-infrastructure/	2025-02-10T23:12:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1247620452.jpeg
Drone strike reportedly targets Russia's key Saratov oil refinery	A drone strike targeted the Saratov oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast on Feb. 11, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. &quot;The Saratov Oil Refinery is one of the key facilities in Russia&apos;s fuel infrastructure. Its refining capacity reaches 7 million tons of oil annually,&quot; Kovalenko said, adding that the refinery is crucial in supplying fuel to the Russian military. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones struck an industrial facility in the region but did not specify whether it was the oil refinery. &quot;Operational services are working in the places where debris could have possibly fallen. According to preliminary data, there are no victims,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. 0:00/1&#xD7;Alleged aftermath of the drone attack on Saratov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 11, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko / Telegram)Russian Telegram channels reported explosions and a fire at the facility, while Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over Saratov Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Saratov, a city nearly 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, hosts multiple strategic military and industrial sites. The last known Ukrainian attack on Saratov Oblast occurred overnight on Jan. 8, igniting a large fire at an oil depot in the city of Engels, according to Russian Telegram channels.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-target-russias-key-saratov-oil-refinery/	2025-02-10T23:00:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Saratov-Feb-11.jpeg
‘Ukraine may be Russian someday,’ Trump suggests while announcing $500 billion rare earth 'agreement'	U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine may or may not lose its sovereignty to Russia, adding he wants compensation for the provided U.S. aid regardless of how the war ends, he said in an interview with Fox News published on Feb. 10. &quot;They (Ukraine) may make a deal. They may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday. But we&#x2019;re going to have all this money in (Ukraine) and I say, I want it back,&quot; Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Breit Baier. The U.S. president has repeatedly pledged to broker a swift peace deal to end the full-scale war nearing its third anniversary, claiming that the conflict would have never happened if he had been in office in 2022. Following up on his earlier proposition of ensuring the U.S. support for Ukraine in exchange for rare earth minerals, Trump claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal on a $500 billion resource deal. &quot;I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth (minerals), and they&#x2019;ve essentially agreed to do that,&quot; the U.S. president said. Ukraine has already signaled it is open to developing a partnership in resource extraction with the U.S. and other partners in exchange for security guarantees, but details on such a deal remain murky. In the interview, Trump again claimed that the U.S. had provided more support to Ukraine than European partners, placing Washington&apos;s contribution to over $300 billion. The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed last month that less than half of that assistance arrived in Ukraine. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Despite pledges to broker a deal within 100 days, the Trump administration has provided few details on a possible peace plan. Trump&apos;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, who is set to visit Ukraine on Feb. 20, is reportedly preparing several options for a ceasefire deal to be presented to the White House. Later this week, Zelensky is expected to meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference, as well as Trump in Washington, to discuss the ongoing conflict and a possible resolution. The U.S. president has also recently revealed he has been in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin after planning a face-to-face meeting, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-be-russian-someday-trump-suggests-while-announcing-500-billion-rare-earth-agreement/	2025-02-10T22:43:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197808420.jpg

Lithuania to allocate $32 million for education of Ukrainian refugees	Lithuania will allocate nearly 32 million euros ($32.9 million) in 2025 to support the education of Ukrainians who have relocated to the country due to the war, Lithuanian broadcaster LRT announced on Feb. 9. The funding will allocate 4.2 million euros ($4.3 million) to cover university tuition, grants, and scholarships. 28.7 million euros ($29.5 million) will cover education for Ukrainian children in pre-school, primary, municipal, and private schools. The funds will be designated for Ukrainians who enrolled in Lithuanian universities in 2022-2023. A decision on additional funding starting September 2025 will be made later, depending on the number of potential students. Lithuania has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine in many areas since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including through humanitarian initiatives, military aid, and diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-to-allocate-32-million-for-education-of-ukrainian-refugees/	2025-02-10T20:59:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-20_12-42-11.jpg
US Congressman proposes bill to restore lend-lease for Ukraine program	U.S. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson announced his plan to introduce the Freedom First Lend-Lease Act to Congress, on Feb. 10. Reauthorizing this program would grant U.S. President Donald Trump the authority to send Ukraine weapons through lend-lease. Wilson argued that this initiative would help deter &quot;War Criminal (Vladimir) Putin&quot; and he claimed that former U.S. President Joe Biden should have taken similar action earlier. &#x201C;Bring Russia to the table through American strength,&#x201D; Wilson wrote on X. Currently, details about the bill remain unclear, including whether it has support from other members of Congress. The $895 billion U.S. defense bill passed by Congress in Dec. 2024 did not include a provision to extend the lend-lease act for Ukraine. The U.S. passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act in May 2022, but it expired in September 2023 without ever being used. Ukrainian diplomats have been lobbying for its reintroduction as it allows the U.S. president to loan or lease arms to Ukraine while cutting through congressional red tape.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congressman-proposes-bill-to-restore-lend-lease-for-ukraine-program/	2025-02-10T19:30:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg
Russian court sentences soldier for killing 4 other servicemen, Mediazona reports	Russian Corporal Nikita Posmetukhov was sentenced to life in prison on Feb. 10 by Russian authorities for shooting four other Russian soldiers in November 2023, Mediazona reported. Russian troops have deserted or sabotaged operations as Russia presses on with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine for over three years with high casualties, using so-called &quot;meat wave&quot; tactics to gain ground. Posmetukhov was allegedly angry with a captain who imposed disciplinary measures and threatened to transfer him to an assault unit, according to a document provided Mediazona. The Southern District Military Court did not officially describe the incidents as the case proceeded behind closed doors. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the details of the incident as outlined by Mediazona. The soldier is accused of killing the patrolmen of a command bunker which Posmetukhov entered after having a drink. The accused allegedly killed Junior Sergeant Vladimir Glazyev in the bunker, according to findings by Mediazona. After the incident, Posmetukhov allegedly entered a dugout and shot Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Klyukin, Captain Mikhail Trubin, and Private Vladimir Petrichenko while they were sleeping. At the conclusion of the closed-door trial, Posmetukhov was found guilty of killing two or more people &quot;for official activities and out of hooligan motives,&quot; and charged with &quot;violent actions against military command in the context of an armed conflict&quot; under the Russian criminal code. As Russia presses on with its war against Ukraine, Russia has lost over 850,000 troops and high equipment losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-sentences-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-allegedly-shooting-4-other-soldiers/	2025-02-10T17:02:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
German authorities investigating assets of sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, Spiegel reports	Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is under investigation for undeclared assets in Germany, Spiegel reported on Feb. 8, citing the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office. Abramovich is widely known as the former owner of the Chelsea soccer club. The Russian billionaire allegedly owes up to $1.2 billion in unpaid taxes in the U.K., a media investigation has found. The EU has imposed sanctions on Abramovich, requiring the billionaire to declare his assets. If found guilty, Abramovich could face hefty fines or up to a year in prison for failing to report his assets. Luxury cars including two Bugatti Chirons, a Lamborghini Reventon, and a Mercedes CLK GTR have been frozen while authorities in Germany investigate, Spiegel reported. Several pieces of artwork have been confiscated from a villa in Bavaria that persecutors allege belong to Abramovich. The billionaire&apos;s lawyers maintain Abramovich is not the owner of the villa or the frozen luxury cars. When reached for comment by Spiegel, the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office confirmed it was investigating a &quot;58-year-old businessman from the Russian Federation&quot; under the country&apos;s Foreign Trade Act, although did not confirm directly that it was Abramovich. Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU and the U.K. following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The billionaire unsuccessfully appealed for the sanctions to be removed in 2023. Abramovich was forced to sell the Chelsea soccer club he once owned due to sanctions. U.K. lawmakers have called for assets from the sale to be spent on Ukraine aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-authorities-investigating-russian-billionaire-roman-abramovich-for-undeclared-assets/	2025-02-10T15:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-521573236.jpg
EU to review its foreign aid programs amid US decision to reform USAID	The European Union will review its multibillion-euro foreign aid program to align the distribution of funds &quot;more closely&quot; with its foreign policy interests, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 10. The EU&apos;s move coincided with the Trump administration&apos;s plans to liquidate the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Meanwhile, the European Commission is also grappling with the challenges of rising defense spending due to the war in Ukraine and views divergence with the new U.S. policies. The European Commission will update the provision of foreign aid and make it more &quot;targeted for partners,&quot; Bloomberg reported, citing the draft document. The EU seeks to restructure its foreign aid to meet its strategic interests, including strengthening alliances with like-minded countries, securing access to raw materials, and curbing the influx of migrants, according to the media. The EU&apos;s overall budget, which traditionally amounts to about 1% of the bloc&apos;s GDP, is overstretched given the wide range of demands, from the green transition to defense. In the coming weeks, the European Commission will outline ideas for improving its next seven-year budget from 2028 to 2034, Bloomberg said. Trump has targeted USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, from his first days in office. His administration has ordered a three-month freeze on nearly all international development funding and reportedly plans to lay off most of the agency&apos;s global workforce. The White House has repeatedly accused USAID of widespread waste and fraud, even though foreign aid comprises only 1% of the federal budget. The administration earlier this week placed the agency under the control of the State Department. Crews were seen on Feb. 7 removing the USAID signage from the front of the agency&apos;s headquarters in Washington. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency&apos;s programs help to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, repair critical energy infrastructure, and fund civil society initiatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-review-its-foreign-aid-programs-amid-us-decision-to-reform-usaid/	2025-02-10T14:16:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151789882.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia massing troops for new assaults in Chasiv Yar; Ukraine strikes oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai	Key developments on Feb. 10: Russian forces are gathering troops for fresh assaults in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, a spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Feb. 10. Chasiv Yar in Ukraine&apos;s east has been one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The town, located 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kramatorsk, has been under Russian attack since early 2024. &quot;Now there is a period of accumulation and concentration (of Russian forces)... on the approaches to Chasiv Yar and regrouping in the town itself for further assault operations,&quot; Zaporozhets said on national television. The spokesperson added that over the past week, Russian forces have avoided using armored vehicles, instead relying on quad bikes and buggies for logistical support. On Jan. 29, The Moscow Times reported that Chasiv Yar had fallen to Russian forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially confirmed the claim. Comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers indicate that intense fighting continues in the town. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces slowing Russia&apos;s advances through brutal street-to-street combat. Despite Russian pressure, Ukrainian defenders resist, preventing a rapid breakthrough. Drones attacked Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10, reportedly targeting the Afipskiy oil refinery, a key facility processing 6.25 million tons of oil annually, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. The refinery, located roughly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the front line, is a strategic logistics hub for diesel fuel and aviation kerosene used by Russian troops, Kovalenko said. While other Ukrainian officials have not commented on the report, the strike would align with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to disrupt Russian fuel supplies and reduce Moscow&apos;s war funding. It is not immediately clear whether the refinery suffered significant damage in the attack. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed the drone attack against the region, saying that a residential complex in Krasnodar was hit. According to the governor, downed drone debris fell on a technical superstructure of a high-rise building, causing no casualties. The Russian Telegram channel Shot, close to Russian security forces, reported that residents heard powerful explosions around 2:00 a.m. local time, with eyewitnesses noting &quot;air defense activity&quot; near the Afipskiy refinery. Kovalenko emphasized the refinery&apos;s importance, claiming it provides fuel for Russian military equipment, particularly in southern Ukraine. &quot;That is why the Afipskiy refinery is not only an industrial facility but also an important element of Russia&apos;s military infrastructure,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues, a critical source of funding for its war effort. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 9 that the United States had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to disclose details about his communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Putin had been in contact. Asked whether the conversations occurred before or after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump said: &quot;I&apos;ve had it. Let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve had it. &#xA0;And I expect to have many more conversations.&quot; The president also noted the U.S. was in contact with both Russia and Ukraine. &quot;If we are talking, I don&apos;t want to tell you about the conversations. I do believe we&apos;re making progress.&quot; Trump first revealed he had spoken to Putin during an interview with the New York Post on Feb. 8 without revealing specifics of their talk, adding only that the Russian leader &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has pushed for a swift resolution to the war, aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the administration&apos;s aim to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; Trump announced on Feb. 7 that he might meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington in the coming days and expressed interest in a meeting with Putin &quot;very quickly.&quot; Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has officially approved the domestically-produced Baton (&quot;a loaf of bread&quot; in Ukrainian) drone for use by the Armed Forces, the ministry announced on Feb. 10. The Baton drones are designed to meet military requirements for simplicity and reliability in difficult battlefield conditions. Built on frames of various sizes, they boast high-speed capabilities, allowing them to catch up with and strike targets, according to the ministry. The new drones can operate effectively in extreme weather, including freezing temperatures and intense heat, the ministry said. Ukraine has prioritized drone warfare since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, heavily investing in aerial, naval, and ground-based unmanned systems. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; an initiative to integrate drone technology further into front-line operations. Kyiv has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids, which feature turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a production target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. The Latvian Defense Ministry has ordered an unspecified number of Patria 6x6 armored personnel carriers for Ukraine, the country&apos;s ministry announced on Feb. 10. Latvia has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and pledged to annually allocates 0.25% of its GDP to provide military aid to Ukraine. The Patria 6x6 is a six-wheeled armored personnel carrier produced by the Finnish defense industry company Patria. It can carry up to 10 soldiers and be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transportation, mobile command posts and medical evacuation. Ukraine is expected to receive Patria 6x6 vehicles in late 2025. The delivery will not affect the volume and schedule of the previously placed order for the Latvian army, the statement read. &quot;We will not only support Ukraine in the fight against the occupier, but also test the use and durability of armored vehicles in real combat conditions, which will provide useful lessons for the national Armed Forces,&quot; said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. In early February, Ukrainian Ambassador to Riga Anatolii Kutsevo inspected the production of the first batch of the vehicles in the town of Valmiera. Latvia signed an agreement for the purchase of these vehicles in August 2021. The deal includes an order for more than 200 armored personnel carriers, as part of the Finnish-Latvian-Swedish-German cooperation program.

US foreign aid freeze threatens Russian war crimes investigations in Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign funding has begun to affect international efforts to hold Russia accountable for war crimes in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 10, citing eight unnamed sources and an obtained Ukrainian document. More than 140,000 Russian war crimes have been recorded by Kyiv since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. War crimes include acts such as deliberate attacks on civilians, attacks on cultural sites or medical institutions, torture, and deportations. Six U.S.-funded projects at Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, worth $89 million, are at stake, the document seen by Reuters showed. Funding for at least five of these projects has already been frozen, five sources told Reuters, citing payment disruptions. Those affected were working on issues ranging from preserving evidence from the battlefield to anti-corruption initiatives and reforming Ukraine&apos;s prosecution system. Previously, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said that several commissions involved in judicial selections have either halted work or faced operational issues due to the suspension of the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) operations. Two of the projects were funded by USAID, three by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, and one by the U.S. State Department, according to the document. A total $47 million of the funding was directly allocated to prosecute Russian war crimes, Reuters reported. Additionally, nearly 40 experts at Georgetown University&apos;s International Criminal Justice Initiative, the lead implementing organization of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine (ACA), stopped working, two sources told the news agency. ACA is an international initiative funded by the U.S., U.K. and EU that have provided expertise and oversight to Ukrainian authorities. It has sent more than 150 experienced experts to help Ukrainian prosecutors. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Trump&apos;s administration is reportedly planning to eliminate most positions at USAID, The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Billionaire Elon Musk, now head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump agreed to shut it down.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-foreign-aid-freeze-threatens-russian-war-crimes-investigatin-in-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-02-10T14:00:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1243622325.jpg
Russian soldiers wounded in war in Ukraine receive treatment, rehabilitation in North Korea, ambassador says	Russian soldiers wounded in the war in Ukraine undergo treatment and rehabilitation in North Korea, Alexander Matsegora, Russia&apos;s ambassador to North Korea, said in an interview with the Russian state-controlled media outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta published on Feb. 9. North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past three years, particularly in the context of geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. In the fall of 2024, Russia and North Korea ratified a strategic partnership agreement which includes the development of trade, scientific, technical, and defense cooperation. However, the agreement did not mention the treatment of wounded Russian soldiers. Treatment for the Russian military in North Korea is provided free of charge in &quot;the best hospitals and sanatoriums,&quot; Matsegora said. The ambassador added that &quot;hundreds&quot; of wounded had been sent to North Korea. &quot;When we offered to compensate our (North Korean) friends for at least part of their expenses, they were sincerely offended and asked us never to do it again,&quot; Matsegora said. According to Matsegora, the children of Russian service members killed in Ukraine are vacationing in North Korea, and the two countries are developing university student exchanges. The ambassador added that Russia also supplies North Korea with coal, food, and medicine. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014; including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014; to sending soldiers. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian troops in countering a Ukrainian incursion in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-wounded-in-war-in-ukraine-receive-treatment-rehabilitation-in-north-korea-ambassador-says/	2025-02-10T13:35:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241864963-16583266909s1o2.jpg
Ukraine considering offering high annual salary, free education, interest-free mortgage rates for young volunteer fighters, media reports	The Ukrainian military&apos;s &quot;special contracts&quot; for recruited volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, will reportedly include a number of benefits, including a Hr 1 million ($24,000) annual salary, 0% interest mortgage rates, as well free higher education, Ukrinform reported on Feb. 10. &quot;In the coming days, all details will be official,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky was reportedly overheard saying to Nadia Calvino, the president of the European Investment Bank, during her visit to Kyiv, according to Ukrinform. The reported remarks come after Zelensky revealed in an interview with Reuters on Feb. 8 that the military is planning to introduce the so-called &quot;special contracts.&quot; The move follows reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. President Donald Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The details of the contracts, which Zelensky said will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; would be made public in the coming days. &quot;A person will be able to earn one million hryvnias in a year. In addition, young people who serve for a year in the war will be able to choose a higher education institution and study for free without any exams &#x2014; the state will cover all costs,&quot; Ukrinform quoted Zelensky as saying. &quot;I would also highlight the special mortgage conditions &#x2014; 0% interest, with the state covering all payments.&quot; The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considering-uah-1-million-salary-free-education-preferred-mortgage-rates-for-young-volunteer-fighters-media-reports/	2025-02-10T13:17:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-01-at-12.29.54b.jpg
Ukraine's stocks hit pre-war levels on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, Polish media reports	WIG Ukraine, Ukrainian companies&apos; stock price index on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), rose by almost 25% in a few days, reaching pre-war levels, Polish media outlet Puls Biznesu reported. Financial markets have reacted positively to the U.S. government&apos;s promises to present a plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war soon. Following Donald Trump&apos;s win in the elections, Ukraine&apos;s sovereign bonds rose in price as investors expect a quicker end to the war. Trump and his team say they have made progress in efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with Trump recently telling reporters he has been in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since taking office in January, his administration has pushed for a quick resolution, aiming for a deal within the first 100 days. Investors expect to see the recovery of Ukraine-controlled territories and negotiations on the country&apos;s accession to the EU to follow, creating opportunities for Ukrainian and Polish companies listed on the WSE, Jakub Szkopek, an analyst at investment company Erste Securities told Puls Biznesu. &#x201C;This is especially true for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials with experience in the Ukrainian market. Such (Polish) companies include Grupa Kety, whose liquidity makes it easier for foreign investors to buy shares. The situation is similar with Budimex,&#x201D; said Szkopek. The analyst added that the Ukrainian equity index&apos;s growth positively impacted the stock prices of the largest Polish companies. The WIG Ukraine index, which tracks the financial returns of WSE-listed Ukrainian companies, includes the largest agricultural holdings, such as Kernel, Astarta, Ovostar, and IMC.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-stocks-hit-pre-war-levels-on-the-warsaw-stock-exchange-polish-media-reports/	2025-02-10T11:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198207826.jpg
Trump's team to visit Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Representatives of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team are visiting Ukraine this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 10 during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukrinform reported. Zelensky announced on Feb. 4 that the Ukrainian government was &quot;finalizing details&quot; for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Trump&apos;s return to the White House. Yet the president did not specify who exactly would be part of the delegation. &quot;There will be some (high-profile) people from President Trump&apos;s team here in Ukraine this week, even before the Munich Security Conference. Then there will be the conference, and I will have several meetings there, including with the U.S. Vice President (J.D. Vance),&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that it is necessary to focus on joint work between the Ukrainian and U.S. teams. &quot;Of course, there may be different opinions, but (there must be) a common vision of the main things: how to stop (Vladimir) Putin and how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. The Presidential Office also said previously that Ukraine is preparing to host Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&apos;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-to-visit-ukraine-this-week-zelensky-says/	2025-02-10T10:47:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
Kellogg 'preparing options' for ending war in Ukraine to present to Trump, media reports	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is still &quot;preparing options&quot; for ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine to present them to the president later, Semafor reported on Feb. 10, citing three Western officials familiar with the talks. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has been aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. Yet, Trump&apos;s team has not revealed how it plans to end the Russian invasion and announced that it will not present its plan at the Munich Security Conference on February 14-16. Kellogg said that the proposals are still in development during one meeting with U.S. allies, according to Semafor. The envoy also noted that he is eager to meet and coordinate with all officials of each NATO country. Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war, which would involve &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering incentives to both sides. Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing providing access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing. Trump&apos;s special envoy is also expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-preparing-options-for-ending-war-in-ukraine-to-present-to-trump-media-reports/	2025-02-10T10:39:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Negotiations are dictated on the battlefield' — Polish envoy on Russia-Ukraine war	Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. Poland holds a special position among Kyiv&apos;s partners &#x2014; with a shared history of Russian oppression and conquest, its leaders have left no room for doubt that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine represented an existential threat to the region and Europe as a whole. Poland has sent tanks, fighter jets, artillery, and more to boost Ukrainian defenders fighting Russian forces, while the country has opened its doors to nearly 2 million Ukrainian refugees since 2022. Yet Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia has also been marked by tensions, sparked both by historical grievances and modern political and economic factors. The ongoing dispute centered on the World War II-era Volyn massacres by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army of Poles living in what is today western Ukraine and subsequent reprisals. And economic disputes, such as protests by Polish farmers against Ukrainian grain, further complicate ties as Kyiv seeks entry to the EU and the single European market. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Poland&apos;s charge d&apos;affaires in Kyiv, Piotr Lukasiewicz, on Jan. 29 to discuss why Poland stands out among Ukraine&apos;s partners, how to approach the most painful chapters of the shared Polish-Ukrainian history, and why it may be too early to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Since the outbreak of the first invasion, Poland has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine. How has Poland been irreplaceable as an ally? Piotr Lukasiewicz: Four hundred tanks, several hundred APCs (armored personnel carriers), including the modern ones, artillery, spare parts, hundreds of tons of ammunition, thousands of tons of humanitarian and other equipment, military and civilian. The Kyiv Independent: How can we reconcile the fact that Ukraine and Poland have been close allies but also had many heated disputes, even emotional exchanges between Polish and Ukrainian leaders, during the war? Piotr Lukasiewicz: Since we are neighbors, we have our good times and bad times. And such close nations have these ebbs and flows of relations and attitudes. The strategic message from us is that we are here to support Ukraine rather than go back to political and historical discussions from the past. Of course, they are very important to the identity of Ukrainians and Poles. And they have to be somehow resolved, which is happening. The resolution of these disputes is happening as we speak, and I&apos;m happy to report progress on both sides, progress in terms of attitude. People are expecting some form of breakthrough, some form of symbolic act of reconciliation. But these very rarely happen between the nations of Europe. It is a period of reconciliation, rather than an act of reconciliation. It is progress that we call the European Union.

(Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Are you worried that these underlying issues, such as historical and economic disputes, could undermine Poland&apos;s military and security support for Ukraine or, as you call it, this strategic interest? Piotr Lukasiewicz: When historians and specialists gather in Lviv, Kyiv, Warsaw, and Krakow, when Polish leaders come to Ukraine, or Ukrainian leaders go to Poland, and even touch upon the question of history and the troubles from the past, almost in the same sentence they say that if we argue, if we have this heated discussion that prevents us from doing something more, the only one who benefits is Russia. Russia is using its hybrid, information, and malicious influence, both here in Ukraine and Poland, to use this debate to its own benefit. If we turn it into something political, only Russia would benefit. We can always argue about this place or another place, about this number of people killed here, the number of people killed there. This is a matter for serious discussion, and it&apos;s happening. The Kyiv Independent: Just to clarify, we&apos;re talking about Volyn massacres and the victims&apos; exhumations (in Ukraine). Piotr Lukasiewicz: We are talking about the victims, yes. The Kyiv Independent: You spoke against politicizing the Volyn massacres. How would you respond to voices in Ukraine who say that Poland itself is politicizing the issue by linking it to Ukraine&apos;s efforts to join the EU? Several politicians have said that Ukraine will not be able to join the EU unless the Volyn issue is settled. Piotr Lukasiewicz: So there are narratives on both sides. But there are facts on the ground that are moving this process towards a good resolution. What else can I say? Of course, I won&apos;t comment on this politician or another to say whether (what they have said) is true or not. The second thing is that EU accession talks are not conditioned on individual bilateral relations between countries with the candidate states. This applies not only to Ukraine but also to Moldova, the western Balkans, and others. It is merit-based. The European Union is a collection of national interests. So, we are conducting these negotiations with Ukraine with our national interests in mind. But it&apos;s very important to understand &#x2014; for Ukrainians especially &#x2014; that the process is not a Polish-Ukrainian one. It&apos;s a process (involving) all member states. President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda commemorate the victims of the Volyn Massacre in the Ukrainian city of Lutsk on July 9, 2023. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent: There are still many historical topics that are viewed very differently in Poland and Ukraine, such as Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or its commander, Roman Shukhevych. Do you expect that these topics will continue to strain Polish-Ukrainian relations and hinder Ukraine&apos;s effort to join the EU? Piotr Lukasiewicz: As is mentioned in many books, including (Timothy) Snyder&apos;s Bloodlands, Polish and Ukrainian history is full of blood, tragedy, and crimes committed against each other. You mentioned names that sound tragic in Polish history and our understanding of our identity. We are not going to pay respect to these names, but we can&apos;t really influence what Ukrainians think. We are not going to choose heroes for neighboring nations. But it&apos;s very important for me and the Polish people, Polish historians, and Polish politicians that what is happening now, in the last 12 years of the Ukrainian struggle against the Russian empire, is that these times are producing greater, better, more suitable heroes for Ukrainian identity. If you look at our embassy here in Kyiv, you will notice the pictures of Ukrainian soldiers with Polish roots. These are Poles living here in Ukraine who resisted the Russian invasion during the last 12 years. For me, these are true heroes. I can relate to, and understand them. I&apos;m Polish, they were Polish-Ukrainian. I&apos;m not advising Ukrainians to build their history only on them. But their examples, their beautiful faces, which are shown at our embassy&#x2026; there you can say: &quot;These are the heroes that we can build our friendly relations upon.&quot; These are the people who are fighting for modern Ukraine, not for Ukraine as it was 100 or 70 years ago. They are future-oriented heroes rather than heroes who wrote many, many ugly things in the past. If Ukrainian society is trying to understand or is searching for a national example in history, it should also look at what happened between Poles and Germans, between French and Germans, and between many nations and how they reconciled. This was based on European values of reconciliation &#x2014; European Union values. This should be future-oriented rather than expressing the sole identity of a particular nation. Russia is not threatening only Ukraine, or only Polish independence, or Latvian, Lithuanian, or Estonian independence. They are collectively threatening Europe as a whole rather than our own particular, individual identity. The Kyiv Independent: Poland took over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU this January with the promise to help Ukraine speed up the accession process. What steps can Poland take in this regard? Piotr Lukasiewicz: First, you should remember that the presidency of the EU Council is not what it used to be. It is a management rather than a leadership position. But what we can do is that we can speed up the discussion. For instance, the opening of so-called clusters or chapters of negotiations is a process of three or four steps &#x2014; accepting the screening report, issuing the benchmarks, and then starting negotiations. So there are three or four steps that we can speed up during these six months, to maintain the Ukrainian agenda at the highest possible level, conduct very professional, merit-based, but still fast negotiations. And we are seeing great will from the Ukrainian side to speed up this process. We are working to achieve the unanimity of the votes among the representatives of the member states in Brussels. And we are quite optimistic in delivering this first chapter, the so-called fundamentals, in the next two or three months. Second, Poland had its own history of accession. We are very similar to Ukraine in terms of size, demographics, and type of economy. During our presidency, we want to share the best experiences, practices, and lessons learned by Polish negotiators. The Kyiv Independent: What do you see as the main obstacles to Ukraine&apos;s EU accession efforts? Piotr Lukasiewicz: It&apos;s the particular interests of the member states that can be driven by individual interests rather than strategic interests in mind. The strategic interest of the EU as a whole is Ukraine as a free and democratic member in, hopefully, the best and fastest possible way. The Kyiv Independent: But looking from the perspective of Poland specifically, are you, for example, worried about accepting Ukraine into a single European market? We saw the mass protests and border blockades that came as a result of Ukrainian agricultural imports. Piotr Lukasiewicz: You are asking about Poland&apos;s particular interest, which I&apos;m trying to put into a different perspective. It&apos;s a collective negotiation of all member states rather than just Poland and Ukraine. When we were entering the European market, we had this period of delay in particular sectors of the economy. In the first period of our membership, the farmers were paid both by the EU and our government. I remember very well the Polish lessons, a kind of disillusionment when several member states in 2000, 2002, and 2003 were voicing the same thing you asked &#x2014; how the Polish accession to Europe would change the agricultural market further west in France or Spain? Every nation has its own agricultural or economic interests. This is the experience we should pass on to Ukrainians so they can understand how they have to adapt to the common market, and how they have to change their structure, transportation policy, and agricultural infrastructure. What we are trying to do for Ukraine is help them understand that it&apos;s not Poland that is particularly blocking something. It&apos;s a collection of the national interests of other member states as well. We also have to adapt to this changing market. But the Polish example is that since we joined the European market with all the obstacles I mentioned, our GDP has grown almost by 300%. After 20 years, we are three times richer than we were when we entered. This is an example that Ukrainians should consider. It is not a threat to them or to us. It&apos;s rather a question of adapting to new economic realities. The Kyiv Independent: With the start of the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, there are expectations that Europe should take greater responsibility for helping Ukraine resist Russian aggression and for ensuring the security of Europe as a whole. What role can Poland, as one of the most powerful militaries on the continent, play in this regard? Piotr Lukasiewicz: I&apos;m in a very privileged position among the ambassadors here in Kyiv to say that we are actually answering the calls to spend much more on defense. Everywhere you go, Poland is being given as an example of how to spend, what to spend, and how much to spend on defense. Of course, we cannot sit back and say: &quot;Okay, we achieved 5% (of GDP on defense spending), we are done.&quot; So we are calling on other nations that are lagging behind with this expenditure. Secondly, given the importance of the Polish geographical position vis-a-vis Ukraine, we notice a much greater interest from our Central European and Nordic allies to gather around the example of Poland and the necessity to work together. I&apos;m talking about these northern formats organized by the Polish government this year. The second format is the so-called Weimar Plus with France, Germany, and Poland being the core. And plus several other nations, the so-called big European five. The Kyiv Independent: One hotly debated subject recently was the possibility of deploying European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire deal in Ukraine. What is Poland&apos;s position toward this idea? Piotr Lukasiewicz: A very clear position. There is no description of such a mission. There is no definition of such a mission. If there is a ceasefire, hopefully with the best Ukrainian position, then we will talk about a future peacekeeping contingent or not. It very much depends on what will be achieved on the front lines. We are focusing right now not on discussing possible scenarios of the future, but rather on how to support Ukraine here and now.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe a successful and strong ceasefire deal? Piotr Lukasiewicz: A ceasefire can take many forms. Over the past 12 years, we have observed how the ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine looked, how it was immediately broken by Russia after the first phase of the war in 2014, and how Russia committed itself to gradually invading more and more. It is a rather baseless discussion right now about what (the ceasefire) would look like. What we have now is a heroic defense of Ukraine with the capabilities they have, which we are trying to strengthen. It is the basic knowledge that peace negotiations should be conducted from a position of strength. And we are helping Ukraine to achieve the best achievable position in these future talks. The second thing is that we cannot adopt the kind of mental position that Russia is enforcing something. We should be speaking from a position of strength &#x2014; we are 10 times bigger in the sense of military, economy, and many advantages Europe has over Russia. It is us who should be imposing our conditions on Russia and imposing our threats on the Russian economy. The Kyiv Independent: What should be non-negotiable in possible talks with Russia? For example, Russia recently declared that it will insist on barring Ukraine from entering NATO. Piotr Lukasiewicz: The negotiations are dictated by the battlefield. This is war, not a political process. And the war changes a lot on a monthly basis. So we should not talk about the politics of how we should communicate with Russia, but rather achieve a reality on the ground that would serve political and diplomatic messages, with Ukraine being a leader or an actor in it. Putin wants&#x2026; to have one partner, one of the big global powers, so he can be again seen as a global leader. And we are in the same basket with the Ukrainians, the Czechs, the Germans, and others being talked over our heads, about our agency, existence, and well-being. So, the basic condition for us, as for many Europeans, is strengthening Ukraine and then being part of the scenario or architecture in the future. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

As US cuts Ukraine funding, EU's lending arm steps in with nearly 1 billion euros in investments	The European Union&apos;s lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB), has signed agreements to mobilize close to 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) in investments into Ukraine&#x2019;s public and private sectors as the U.S. moves to cut funding to development projects in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s decision to freeze all foreign assistance has cast uncertainty on the future of projects in Ukraine in nearly every sector, from critical infrastructure to civil society development. Nadia Calvino, the EIB&apos;s president, said at a press briefing on Feb. 10 that she had discussed Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent funding needs with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to see where the bank could fill the gaps if international partners withdraw their support. &quot;We discussed the priority areas where the EIB could step up its support &#x2014; for example, in the areas of border management, transport, energy, and municipalities,&quot; Calvino said in Kyiv during her first visit to the country since taking up office as head of the EIB a year ago. &quot;We&#x2019;re working very closely with the government to finance the necessary investments to rebuild, repair, and make national infrastructure more resilient,&quot; she said. The investment announced on Feb. 10 includes 420 million euros ($433 million) in Ukraine&#x2019;s public sector to help restore critical infrastructure such as energy, heating, water supply, hospitals, schools, and social housing. On the private sector side, the bank has signed an agreement to mobilize close to 500 million euros ($515 million) in financing for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the whole country, including in front-line regions, Calvino said. The bank also announced the German Economy Ministry is providing a 16.5-million-euro ($17 million) loan through the EIB&#x2019;s climate initiative fund to finance renewable energy projects in Ukraine. &#xA0;The EIB is a key lender in funding Europe&#x2019;s green transition. Calvino said the EIB has been working with the Ukrainian government to speed up the implementation of projects on the ground over the last year. The bank signed a pledge with Ukraine&apos;s government last year to accelerate the deployment of 560 million euros ($596 million) it had ready to help rebuild Ukraine in 2024. &#xA0; &quot;Municipalities and small and medium-sized businesses can start already approaching their banks to see about this financing and we hope that it will be mobilized as soon as possible,&quot; she said at the press briefing. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the EIB has delivered over 2.2 billion euros ($2.26 billion) in financing mainly dedicated to repairing and modernizing Ukraine&#x2019;s municipal infrastructure. This latest round of investment announcements are part of the bank&#x2019;s 2-billion-euro ($2.06 billion) contribution to the EU&#x2019;s 50-billion-euro ($51 billion) Ukraine Facility loan and grant program. As Trump&#x2019;s team looks to negotiate an end to Russia&#x2019;s nearly-three year full-scale invasion of Ukraine, talks of reconstruction in Ukraine have returned to front and center. Russia&#x2019;s constant missile and drone attacks since 2022 have seriously damaged Ukraine&#x2019;s housing, water and energy systems. Costs to rebuild are approaching the $500 billion mark. Calvino said she is sure the EIB will play an important role in supporting the reconstruction of the country &quot;not only because of our direct investment but because of our ability to mobilize public and private investment to support the public and private sector in Ukraine, and beyond.&quot; Meanwhile, European member states recently called on the EIB to increase its lending to the bloc&#x2019;s defense industry and beef up its defenses against any possible Russian attack in the future. &#xA0; The president said she welcomes the support the bank has received from European membes states on stepping up the EIB&#x2019;s role in supporting Europe&#x2019;s defense and security sectors &quot;while safeguarding our financing capacity and AAA rating.&quot; The bank already invested 1 billion euros ($1.03 billion) into the sector last year and plans to double it to 2 billion euros ($2.06 billion) in 2025, she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-us-cuts-ukraine-funding-eus-lending-arm-steps-in-with-nearly-1-billion-euros-in-investments/	2025-02-10T09:03:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196077958.jpg
Russian man admits to killing two war-wounded Ukrainian soldiers in Germany	A Russian national accused of killing two war-wounded Ukrainian soldiers aged 23 and 36, has admitted to the crime in a German court, Deutsche Welle reported on Feb. 10. In April 2024, the suspect and two Ukrainian soldiers who were undergoing rehabilitation in Murnau, Germany, were drinking together in a bar, according to investigators. As a result of an argument about the Russian war in Ukraine, the Russian allegedly stabbed the two men. &quot;Now, in a sober state, I deeply regret what happened,&quot; the 58-year-old suspect said at the start of his trial. Due to the argument, the Russian citizen felt &quot;violated in his national pride,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Central Office for Combating Extremism and Terrorism of the Munich Public Prosecutor. The suspect has been living in Germany since the early 1990s and is a &quot;supporter of an exaggerated Russian nationalism&quot; who &quot;unreservedly advocates the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; according to the indictment. On April 27, 2024, the two Ukrainians were found with stab wounds in a shopping center in Murnau. The 36-year-old man died from severe injuries at the scene, while the 23-year-old died in hospital the same evening. The suspect was also detained on April 27. The investigation did not rule out political motives for the crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-suspected-of-killing-two-war-wounded-ukrainian-soldiers-in-germany-pleads-guilty-in-court/	2025-02-10T08:49:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2150546515.jpg
The Baltic Sea’s energy infrastructure is under attack. NATO must act	The European Union and NATO must strengthen cooperation to protect critical energy infrastructure from attacks, which pose a growing threat to European stability. The Kremlin, with its history of weaponizing energy, remains a prime suspect. NATO must properly secure the Baltic Sea &#x2014; the so-called NATO lake. The Baltic states achieved independence from the post-Soviet energy system in February by connecting to the continental grid via Poland. However, this transition is being overshadowed by a series of incidents in the Baltic Sea, underscoring the urgent need to secure the energy bridge from Poland, known as the LitPol Link. Poland and the Baltic states are ramping up their preparations. Energy ministers from the Baltic states and Poland discussed preparations on Jan. 24 for the synchronization scheduled for Feb. 8-9. They announced plans for joint protection of the infrastructure required for this effort, following multiple incidents in the Baltic Sea. The synchronization will proceed without relying on the Estlink 2 cable, which was damaged in one of these incidents. The meeting in Riga focused on finalizing preparations for synchronization and strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure. &#x201C;The damage to the Estlink 2 power cable connecting Finland to Estonia has not impacted the ability of the Baltic states to safely disconnect from the Belarusian and Russian energy system and connect to the European grid,&#x201D; the ministers concluded. Analyses indicate that the Baltic states have sufficient cross-border capacity through Estlink 1, NordBalt, and LitPol Link to synchronize with Europe without relying on Estlink 2. Synchronization entails disconnecting the Baltic states from the post-Soviet BRELL system &#x2014; which will continue to include Belarus and Russia &#x2014; and adapting Baltic energy systems to operate on the continental frequency. The LitPol Link power connection, running through Poland, will facilitate this transition. Synchronizing with the continental grid will eliminate energy exchanges with the BRELL system. This move is particularly significant for Kaliningrad Oblast, which will become an energy island &#x2014; just as the Baltic states would have been if disconnected from BRELL without European synchronization. However, we cannot be sure that other parts of the critical infrastructure needed for a successful disconnection from the post-Soviet system are safe from malign activity. The Baltic states and Poland are enhancing the security of LitPol Link and other critical infrastructure elements to protect the synchronization process. &#x201C;The resilience and protection of infrastructure have never been more important. The Russian Federation is deliberately destroying Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid, and its hybrid activities in the Baltic Sea underscore the importance of a well-secured energy system for defense,&#x201D; said Krzysztof Bolesta, state secretary at Poland&#x2019;s Ministry of Climate and Environment.

(Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images)Poland is also taking lessons from another energy bridge to Lithuania, known as Harmony Link. Rising costs and security considerations led Polish and Lithuanian operators to plan Harmony Link as a subsoil cable instead of the originally proposed sea route. Land-based infrastructure is easier to secure and &#x2014; more importantly &#x2014; can be repaired faster. If sabotage damage can be repaired within a few weeks, the act of sabotage loses much of its impact. That is why the news that Finnish telecom company Elisa managed to repair two undersea cables in about two weeks was so encouraging. Another type of threat is emerging as well. Baltic operators have reported the spread of disinformation regarding the synchronization of their energy systems with Europe. &#x201C;We urge the public to critically evaluate information, resist emotional opinions, and refrain from spreading unverified reports,&#x201D; participants of the Riga meeting emphasized. Beyond spreading fear, the enemy may be attempting to promote a false economic narrative &#x2014; that disconnection from BRELL would significantly increase electricity costs. That narrative is false. According to a study conducted during the preparations, the average increase in energy prices for consumers with an average consumption of 140 kWh per month would be minimal: 50 cents per month in Lithuania, 60 cents in Estonia, and around one euro in Latvia. Relatively speaking, this is not a heavy impact. In return, the Baltic states gain energy independence from the Russian operator and market coupling with Europe, which promotes price decreases. Energy system operators in Poland and the Baltic states have been instructed by their governments to implement an urgent package of measures to enhance the security of critical energy infrastructure. Lithuania&#x2019;s Interior Ministry expedited the strengthening of the LitPol Link cable&#x2019;s protection, advancing the timeline from April to Jan. 15 in response to the severing of the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia on Dec. 26, 2024. Poland is also taking action. &#x201C;Polish Transmission System Operator (PSE) ensures the protection of transmission infrastructure within the Republic of Poland&#x2019;s territory. The company collaborates with relevant national services and institutions, as well as transmission system operators in neighboring countries,&#x201D; PSE stated in a comment for the Energy Drink podcast. &#x201C;Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, a state of heightened readiness has been in place, and the infrastructure is continuously monitored, with particular attention given to interconnections with Lithuania, Sweden, and Ukraine. New measures to enhance physical security are also being implemented.&#x201D; (L-R) Henna Virkkunen, Mette Frederiksen, Ulf Kristersson, Gitanas Naus&#x117;da, Alexander Stubb, Mark Rutte, Kristen Michal, Edgars Rink&#x113;vi&#x10D;s, Olaf Scholz, and Donald Tusk pose at the Baltic Sea NATO summit in Helsinki, Finland, on Jan. 14, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva/AFP via Getty Images)PSE reports ongoing collaboration with operators in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to strengthen regional infrastructure protection. &#x201C;Discussions are underway about launching joint projects in this area and securing EU funding for them,&#x201D; the statement adds. The increasing frequency of attacks on critical infrastructure &#x2014; such as the recent incident involving the undersea cable between Latvia and Gotland &#x2014; highlights the difficulty of attributing blame in a complex and interconnected world. Scandinavian media reports suggest it could have been an accident. However, there have been too many such &#x201C;accidents&#x201D; since Russia&#x2019;s unlawful aggression against Ukraine began. The West needs to take the initiative and stop retreating. The EU and NATO must develop new tools and strategies to address these challenges and protect collective security &#x2014; especially in the Baltic Sea, which must be properly secured as a NATO-controlled waterway.

NABU confirms 'pre-trial investigation' of Defense Minister Umerov over potential abuse of power	Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has confirmed it is investigating possible abuses of power by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, the agency&apos;s director Semen Kryvonos said at a press conference on Feb. 10. A &quot;pre-trial investigation&quot; was launched after Umerov dismissed Marina Bezrukova from her post as director of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and appointed Arsen Zhumadilov in her place, prompting the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) to file a complaint with NABU. &quot;The pre-trial investigation is ongoing, and all the circumstances are being determined &#x2014; whether there is a crime or not, whether there are perpetrators or not,&quot; Kryvonos said. &quot;I would not say that criminal proceedings have been initiated against anyone. It was initiated based on a complaint about possible abuses,&quot; he added. NABU launched the pre-trial investigation on Jan. 28. The dismissal of Bezrukova followed a week of escalating tensions between the ministry and the DPA. On Jan. 21, the DPA supervisory board voted unanimously to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. But due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Zhumadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are unlawful. ANTAC accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment. Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025. Umerov also dismissed two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the situation on Feb. 2, saying that the defense minister has the right to do everything to ensure that supplies do not slow down. According to Ukrainian law, if officials have abused their power or position in a manner leading to &quot;serious consequences,&quot; they are punishable by imprisonment for three to six years and disqualified from holding certain positions or engaging in certain activities for up to three years.	https://kyivindependent.com/pre-trial-investigation-ongoing-national-anti-corruption-bureau-looking-into-umerovs-potential-abuse-of-power-office-position/	2025-02-10T08:00:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648104571.jpg
Ukraine to receive Patria 6x6 armored vehicles from Latvia this year	The Latvian Defense Ministry has ordered an unspecified number of Patria 6x6 armored personnel carriers for Ukraine, the country&apos;s ministry announced on Feb. 10. Latvia has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and pledged to annually allocates 0.25% of its GDP to provide military aid to Ukraine. The Patria 6x6 is a six-wheeled armored personnel carrier produced by the Finnish defense industry company Patria. It can carry up to 10 soldiers and be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transportation, mobile command posts and medical evacuation. Ukraine is expected to receive Patria 6x6 vehicles in late 2025. The delivery will not affect the volume and schedule of the previously placed order for the Latvian army, the statement read. &quot;We will not only support Ukraine in the fight against the occupier, but also test the use and durability of armored vehicles in real combat conditions, which will provide useful lessons for the national Armed Forces,&quot; said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. In early February, Ukrainian Ambassador to Riga Anatolii Kutsevo inspected the production of the first batch of the vehicles in the town of Valmiera. Latvia signed an agreement for the purchase of these vehicles in August 2021. The deal includes an order for more than 200 armored personnel carriers, as part of the Finnish-Latvian-Swedish-German cooperation program.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-patria-6x6-armored-vehicles-from-latvia-by-2025-ministry-says/	2025-02-10T06:42:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GjbD8SLX0AA3_Qz.jpg
Ukraine approves high-speed Baton drones for battlefield deployment	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has officially approved the domestically-produced Baton (&quot;a loaf of bread&quot; in Ukrainian) drone for use by the Armed Forces, the ministry announced on Feb. 10. The Baton drones are designed to meet military requirements for simplicity and reliability in difficult battlefield conditions. Built on frames of various sizes, they boast high-speed capabilities, allowing them to catch up with and strike targets. The new drones can operate effectively in extreme weather, including freezing temperatures and intense heat, the ministry said. Ukraine has prioritized drone warfare since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, heavily investing in aerial, naval, and ground-based unmanned systems. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; an initiative to integrate drone technology further into front-line operations. Kyiv has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids, which feature turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a production target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-high-speed-baton-drones-for-battlefield-deployment/	2025-02-10T05:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/small_whatsapp-image-2025-02-10-at-14-03-21-8d5a19a207-2.webp
Czech authorities investigating allegations of unauthorized drone shipments to Ukraine	Prague is investigating allegations of unauthorized drone shipments from Czechia to Ukraine, Ceske Noviny reported on Feb. 9, citing Defense Minister Jana Cernochova. The investigation is focused on the Nemesis project, organized by the Skupina D association, which has been raising funds to procure drones for Ukraine. According to media outlet Aktualne.cz, members of Skupina D are suspected of supplying drones to Ukraine, possibly with the involvement of Czech military personnel, without authorization from the parliament. Czech military police spokesperson Katerina Mlynkova confirmed that authorities are examining &quot;possible unauthorized handling of Defense Ministry property and possible use of military personnel outside the tasks of the armed forces.&quot; According to Aktualne.cz, members of the Czech Army&apos;s 601st Special Forces Group allegedly transported military equipment to Ukraine without the necessary parliamentary approval. The Czech constitution requires lawmakers&apos; consent before deploying national armed forces abroad. An unnamed source cited by the outlet claimed that &quot;someone decided to send soldiers&quot; to Ukraine with military equipment without following proper legal procedures. At least one such trip reportedly took place in 2024. &quot;We can&apos;t just close up and say everything is fine when we know it&apos;s not, based on the inspection,&quot; Cernochova said. Last year, Cernochova voiced concerns over the Czech Army&apos;s General Staff&apos;s participation in the Nemesis initiative. The Defense Ministry subsequently launched an inspection over the use of military facilities for drone testing. Chief of Staff of the Czech Army, General Karel Rehka, is the honorary chairman of Skupina D. According to the Czech media, Rehka&apos;s relationship with Minister Cernochova has long been mired by disputes over defense procurement. Despite the controversy, the Nemesis drone initiative has gained significant public support, raising over 203 million Czech crowns ($8.5 million) to supply drones to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/czech-authorities-investigating-drone-shipments-to-ukraine/	2025-02-10T05:45:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/dsc00143.jpg
Romanian President Iohannis announces resignation to avert political crisis	Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Feb. 10 to avert a possible crisis caused by an upcoming parliamentary vote on his impeachment. Far-right opposition parties submitted, for the third time, an initiative to the Romanian parliament to impeach the president, as Iohannis remained in office longer than the prescribed term after the results of the country&apos;s first round of presidential election had been annulled. Speaking to reporters, Iohannis said he is resigning to avoid the internal and external crisis in Romania. &quot;We will become a laughingstock for the whole world,&quot; he said. Iohannis&apos;s resignation will enter into force on Feb. 12. According to the Romanian constitution, Senate chairman Ilie Bolojan from the National Liberal Party should serve as the interim head of state. Iohannis has served as Romania&apos;s president since 2014. His second presidential term ended on Dec. 21, but he remained in office until his successor was sworn in. The results of the first round were annulled by the constitutional court over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok meant to prop up far-right Romanian politician Calin Georgescu. Pro-Russian Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner after the Nov. 24 vote, securing 23% of the ballots. Pro-EU candidate Elena Lasconi came in second with 19%. The far-right politician, who has opposed military support for Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania, remains the leading candidate for the rescheduled vote in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-president-announces-resignation/	2025-02-10T05:33:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184592124.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Inside Ukraine's historic first all-drone assault on Russian positions	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Feb. 8, 2025, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine &#x2014; In the early hours of December 2024, as the sun began to rise, the sound of drones filled the air. But this wasn&#x2019;t just any drone operation. This was the first successful all-drone assault on Russian positions &#x2014; a groundbreaking event in the history of modern warfare. The attack took place near Lyptsi, in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine. Initially expected to fail, the mission tested whether multiple drone units could coordinate an assault with dozens of FPV, recon, turret-mounted, and kamikaze drones working in unison on the ground and in the air. The Counteroffensive is the first news outlet to publish a detailed account of this milestone in drone warfare, based on interviews with some of the unit&#x2019;s military officers. &quot;Happy,&quot; the call sign of a soldier from Mykolaiv Oblast, is known for his ever-present smile and a mustache groomed to resemble that of a Zaporizhzhian Cossack. He chose the distinctive look to stand out. For security reasons, he asked to be identified only by his call sign. At just 22 years old, he commands a platoon known as the Ground Unmanned Robotics Unit, nicknamed &#x201C;Deus Ex Machina,&#x201D; which translates from Latin as &#x201C;a God from a machine.&#x201D; &#x201C;We will be here until the end. We will defend our land, and we will move forward to victory with confidence,&#x201D; Happy told The Counteroffensive. Happy graduated from a military university in Kyiv and later joined the Khartiia Brigade. His background is in military engineering, with a focus on demining and placing mines. He spoke while alternating between curling his Ukrainian-styled mustache and taking drags from his cigarette. Happy began commanding the platoon this past summer. In just a few months, he and his unit became quick experts in using, innovating with, and repairing Ukrainian ground drones &#x2014; while also developing effective tactics for using them alongside other weaponry. &#x201C;When we felt discomfort, we developed. We did not have expertise in drones, so it was uncomfortable for us,&#x201D; Happy explained. &#x201C;It forced us to work more intensively on ourselves and with drones.&#x201D; The unit has a less-strict culture than the rest of the Ukrainian military, reflecting its role as a laboratory for cutting-edge military innovations. &quot;It doesn&apos;t really matter what your rank is. It depends on people. If you have people who can do things efficiently, we don&#x2019;t care about your rank. It can be some random soldier who does better work than a high-profile officer. We don&#x2019;t care about this,&quot; said &#x201C;Mathematician,&#x201D; an officer who advises units on using drone technology for maximum tactical impact. The units involved in this assault were tasked by the Khartiia Brigade commander with a mission: could they organize an all-drone assault within a week &#x2014; and pull it off?

(Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;I was skeptical&#x2026; and didn&#x2019;t expect any level of success,&#x201D; Mathematician said, adding that the higher-ups half-expected they would soon receive word that the drone force had been wiped out early in the mission. To make this work, they needed to invent a new playbook. It was a completely novel approach to an assault. As part of the planning, they established checkpoints, routes, and designated communication channels. The assault was rehearsed three times, with one of the main concerns being that the Russians might spot the incoming wave of Ukrainian drones and destroy them before they could be deployed effectively. Given the significant ordnance being carried by the ground drones, an early Russian counterattack could have caused the kamikaze drones to explode, destroying the entire assault force. Forty-eight hours before the mission, drones were moved to their starting points. Success was defined as all drones arriving at their targets and hitting their designated assignments. The mission involved complex logistics and communication. No swarm technology was used, meaning each drone was piloted by an individual operator. Less than 100 soldiers participated in the operation, including pilots, logisticians, planners, and support staff &#x2014; launching around 30 drones, according to Mathematician. The operation used several kamikaze and machine-gun-mounted ground drones, FPVs &#x2014; including one with a mounted assault rifle &#x2014; and large copter drones that dropped munitions. Dozens of surveillance and recon drones provided battlefield awareness. Multiple units were involved, though the Ukrainian military declined to specify which units or how many. They also declined to share how the troops communicated. What is known is that the ground and aerial drones worked together, with pilots stationed in different locations, coordinating the mission while monitoring the battlefield from a shared video feed. What took days to plan took just one or two hours to execute. The assault took place along a heavily fortified Russian position near a large forest. The simultaneous waves of ground and aerial drones caught the Russians off guard, causing panic. While aerial drone attacks are common on the front lines, the coordinated use of ground drones was unexpected. Ukrainian forces intercepted Russian communications revealing chaos and fear among Russian troops, who were fighting machines with no human soldiers in sight. This was the intended effect: to create pressure on the Russian lines and suppress the enemy. Thanks to careful planning, they didn&#x2019;t lose any drones to Russian electronic warfare, which often disrupts communication between pilots and drones. Several Russian FPV drones attempted to strike the attacking Ukrainian drones but were unsuccessful. Terrain posed a major challenge. Ukrainian mud, known for its thick, sticky texture, made movement difficult for cars, tanks, and ground drones alike. The trade-off between air and ground drones comes down to payload. Air drones can fly over obstacles but carry much less weight, while ground drones carry more but must contend with thick mud and foliage. During the mission, one Ukrainian ground drone got stuck in the mud. However, a planner from the unit noted it was never destroyed and was eventually recovered. The mission exceeded expectations: right after the ground drones completed their task, infantry moved in and secured the position, Mathematician told The Counteroffensive. Ukrainian troops still hold the position today. The goal of the mission was to save Ukrainian lives. The more drones are used in operations, the fewer human lives are at risk. &quot;The advantage is obvious: robots do it, not people. And if robots are destroyed, they don&#x2019;t feel pain. It&#x2019;s just a tin can. It is much better to lose a drone than the life of a human,&#x201D; Happy said. This success will likely lead to more iterations, experimentation, and larger-scale attacks. &quot;This is just the beginning. We will work to do more &#x2014; and even better &#x2014; missions,&quot; Happy said. When not working with drones, Happy is a fan of Stephen King novels. He&#x2019;s no stranger to the horror of unintended consequences. He is particularly concerned about how artificial intelligence might merge with drone technology. While drones can&#x2019;t make most decisions without human input &#x2014; yet &#x2014; he worries about the potential for a major mistake. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a matter of time before a person makes a big mistake,&#x201D; he said. Despite these concerns, Happy remains optimistic about the immediate future. He is also disinterested in taking credit for this significant achievement in military technology. For now, he&#x2019;s unsure how to contextualize the achievement. Perhaps he will only understand its significance years from now, with the benefit of time. Right now, it&apos;s too close to what happened. And there&apos;s still much work to do.

Russia massing troops for new assaults in Chasiv Yar, military warns	Russian forces are concentrating troops for fresh assaults in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, a spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Feb. 10. Chasiv Yar in Ukraine&apos;s east has been one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The town, located 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kramatorsk, has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July 2024. &quot;Now there is a period of accumulation and concentration (of Russian forces)... on the approaches to Chasiv Yar and regrouping in the town itself for further assault operations,&quot; Zaporozhets said on national television. The spokesperson added that over the past week, Russian forces have avoided using armored vehicles, instead relying on quad bikes and buggies for logistical support. 0:00/1&#xD7;A view of the streets of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, amid intense fighting as Russia continues its offensive in Ukraine&apos;s east. (Interior Ministry / Facebook).On Jan. 29, The Moscow Times reported that Chasiv Yar had fallen to Russian forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially confirmed the claim. Comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers indicate that intense fighting continues in the town. The battle for Chasiv Yar has been ongoing for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces slowing Russia&apos;s advances through brutal street-to-street combat. Despite Russian pressure, Ukrainian defenders resist, preventing a rapid breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-massing-troops-for-assault-on-chasiv-yar-ukrainian-military-says/	2025-02-10T05:05:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159885054.jpg
Illegal border crossing attempts in Ukraine have nearly halved since last summer, Border Guard says	The State Border Guard has recorded a decrease in attempts to illegally cross Ukraine&apos;s border since July 2024, spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on Feb. 10. &quot;If we compare January with July last year, we see a 45% decrease,&quot; Demchenko said. Speaking on national TV, the spokesperson said that despite this trend, attempts to illegally cross the border occur every day. Men of the conscription age are prohibited from leaving the country during martial law, save for several exceptions. Many attempt to reach neighboring countries in spite of that, hoping to avoid mobilization. Most such cases occurred outside the checkpoints on the border with Romania and Moldova, and fewer cases are recorded on the border with Slovakia and Hungary. The lowest number of attempts to illegally cross the border outside of checkpoints was recorded on the border with Poland, according to the spokesperson. There have been multiple reports of men attempting to illegally flee Ukraine by swimming the Tysa River, which flows along the border with Hungary, Romania, and Moldova. &quot;Attempts to illegally cross the border through checkpoints continue. Most of these cases occur on the border with Poland, because it has the highest passenger traffic,&quot; Demchenko added. People turn to criminal groups to plan a route for escape, offering them money, the spokesperson said. More than 760 such groups have been uncovered since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, including around 40 in January 2025, Demchenko said. Some countries, like Lithuania or Poland, voiced support for helping Ukraine bring back its military-aged men living abroad but rejected the possibility of forcibly deporting them.	https://kyivindependent.com/illegal-border-crossing-attempts-have-nearly-halved-since-last-summer-ukraines-border-guard-says/	2025-02-10T04:31:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152827912.jpg
EU vows retaliatory measures as Trump set to announce 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum	The European Commission on Feb. 10 threatened retaliatory measures if U.S. President Donald Trump goes forward with his plan to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. Trump said on Feb. 9 that Washington would announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. later this week. The EU&apos;s executive arm commented that it had &quot;not received any official notification regarding the imposition of additional tariffs on EU goods&quot; but said it would &quot;react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.&quot; The European Commission criticized the decision as &quot;unlawful and economically counterproductive,&quot; arguing that the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S. would suffer under such restrictions. The dispute over tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on American goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting the tariffs and replacing them with a quota system. In exchange, the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s latest move threatens to reignite the trade dispute. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that tariffs on EU goods could backfire on the U.S. economy by driving inflation. In an interview with CNN, Macron urged Washington to focus on confronting China, managing the Middle East crisis, and supporting Ukraine rather than engaging in a &quot;trade war&quot; with its European allies. The announcement comes amid a flurry of executive orders from Trump&apos;s administration in his first weeks back in office, which have caused domestic and international disruptions. These include freezing foreign aid, tightening immigration policies, and conducting a widespread purge of federal agencies. The freeze on foreign aid has already affected key organizations in Ukraine, including independent media and efforts to repair the country&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-vows-retaliatory-measures-as-trump-announces-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum/	2025-02-10T04:06:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Europe mulls large-scale seizures of Russia's 'shadow fleet' ships, Politico reports	European countries are privately discussing large-scale seizures of Russian oil tankers in the Baltic Sea after a number of incidents, Politico reported on Feb. 10, citing two unnamed EU diplomats and two government officials. The media outlet referred to a late December incident in which an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia was damaged, likely by a tanker believed to be part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. The Eagle S vessel, carrying Russian oil, was detained in Finnish territorial waters in connection to the incident. Helsinki launched an investigation to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that &quot;NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea&quot; following the incident in the Gulf of Finland. According to Politico, European countries are also drafting new legislation that would enable potential seizures of Russian oil tankers on legal grounds. Among the proposals under consideration is the use of international law to seize vessels on environmental or piracy grounds. Individual countries could also make independent decisions, jointly introducing new national laws to arrest ships in more distant maritime zones, the news outlet wrote. Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that nearly 50% of the sanctioned trade in Russian marine oil goes via the Gulf of Finland. The Nordic countries have been on high alert due to mounting security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes in the Nordic countries. The European Union, the U.K., and the U.S. have slapped sanctions on oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet. In early February, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; captains, targeting Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other methods to bypass price caps.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-large-scale-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-politico-reports/	2025-02-10T03:19:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Zelensky-Putin talks and Kursk strike | Ukraine This Week	This Sunday, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur gives updates on Ukraine-Russia peace talks, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s ongoing aid freeze, and the debate surrounding a deadly strike on civilian infrastructure in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-putin-talks-and-kursk-strike-ukraine-this-week/	2025-02-10T03:16:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_8798.jpg
Transnistria rejects EU aid offer under Moscow's pressure, Moldova's PM says	The Moldovan government said that Transnistrian authorities refused to accept the European Union&apos;s offer of 60 million euros ($62 million) in energy aid under pressure from Moscow, the Moldovan media outlet Newsmaker reported on Feb. 10. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that Tiraspol rejected the EU&apos;s financial assistance due to the conditions attached to the aid, attributing the decision to Russian influence. The Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria has faced critical energy shortages since Russia&apos;s Gazprom halted its gas supplies in January, a move coinciding with Ukraine ending a deal on Russian gas transit. The Russian energy giant claimed the decision was taken due to an alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues. &quot;Tiraspol has refused (the EU&apos;s offer of aid). Russia does not allow them to accept European aid for fear of losing control over the region,&quot; Recean said. The European Commission has offered 60 million euros ($62 million) to Transnistria as part of its two-year strategy on energy support for Moldova. The aid package was contingent on commitments from local authorities to improve &quot;fundamental freedoms and human rights&quot; and to ensure that the funds would not be used for &quot;energy-intensive activities.&quot; According to Recean, the primary condition that led Transnistrian authorities to reject the aid was a requirement for a gradual increase in consumer tariffs. &quot;As a result, they cannot receive European aid. This means that the residents of Transnistria will continue to live in a state of unpredictability,&quot; he added. Despite the rejection, Chisinau said it would continue supplying gas to the region. Moldova&apos;s government reached an agreement with Hungary&apos;s MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG, which will secure funding from Dubai&apos;s JNX General Trading to provide gas. &quot;Both companies have been audited and will supply gas to the Moldovan border under a contract with Moldovagaz... This is not an agreement between the Moldovan government and Russia; it is a decision to keep people (in Transnistria) from freezing,&quot; Recean said. Currently leading talks on EU accession, Moldova has pivoted toward European supplies but remains dependent on electricity from Transnistria&apos;s Kuciurgan power plant, which runs on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-rejects-eu-aid-offer-under-moscow-pressure-moldovan-pm-says/	2025-02-10T02:50:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Scholz, Merz agree on continued support for Ukraine ahead of German elections	German Chancellor Olaf Schlolz and his chief challenger in the upcoming elections, Friedrich Merz, agreed during a television debate on Feb. 9 that Berlin must continue supporting Ukraine and that Russia&apos;s war must end as soon as possible. Polls show Merz&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance as a clear favorite for the Feb. 23 snap elections. The vote was called after Social Democrat (SPD) Scholz&apos;s ruling coalition lost the parliamentary majority with the exit of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). During the debate, Merz said that the war &quot;could have ended sooner if Ukraine had been supported more decisively and with less hesitation,&quot; reiterating his earlier position that Germany should provide Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz, whose government has become the second-largest military donor to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war, has long refused to supply the long-range cruise missiles, fearing it could draw Germany into the conflict. Merz called for a united strategy between Europe and the U.S. allies on the Russia-Ukraine war and warned against excluding Ukraine from the conversation. According to the German conservative leader, it is also important to see what Washington&apos;s next steps will be. The German chancellor, in turn, stressed the need to help Ukraine build up a powerful army, reminding the assistance his government had already provided. &quot;We must help Ukraine have a strong army. Because its economy will not be able to finance an army of the size it needs for defense,&quot; Scholz said. Berlin has supplied Kyiv with $11 billion in military assistance since 2022, ranking below only the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The provided hardware included Leopard 1 and 2 tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, Patriot, IRIS-T, and Gepard air defenses, and more. As Ukraine&apos;s leading European backer, Germany is expected to play a key role in the pro-Kyiv coalition amid the uncertain future of U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-merz-agree-on-germanys-continued-support-for-ukraine/	2025-02-10T02:22:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198031078.jpg
European Investment Bank head Calvino arrives in Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The European Investment Bank (EIB) head, Nadia Calvino, arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 10, the EU Ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, announced. The news comes as 19 EU member states have proposed expanding financing for arms production through the EIB on Jan 31. The step aims to ensure that the European defense industry responds appropriately to both short- and long-term challenges, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv signed a financing agreement with the European Investment Bank under the Recovery III project at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin last year. Great to arrive in Kyiv with @NadiaCalvino, welcomed warmly by @Pertsovskyi_O.

Trump claims 'progress' on ending Russia-Ukraine war, confirms contact with Putin	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 9 that the United States had made progress in talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine but declined to disclose details about his communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he and Putin had been in contact. Asked whether the conversations occurred before or after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump said: &quot;I&apos;ve had it. Let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve had it. &#xA0;And I expect to have many more conversations.&quot; The president also noted the U.S. was in contact with both Russia and Ukraine. &quot;If we are talking, I don&apos;t want to tell you about the conversations. I do believe we&apos;re making progress.&quot; Trump first revealed he had spoken to Putin during an interview with the New York Post on Feb. 8 without revealing specifics of their talk, adding only that the Russian leader &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has pushed for a swift resolution to the war, aiming to reach a deal within the first 100 days. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated the administration&apos;s aim to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; Trump announced on Feb. 7 that he might meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington in the coming days and expressed interest in a meeting with Putin &quot;very quickly.&quot; Washington and Kyiv are reportedly discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; though the U.S. president did not specify further. Trump has previously suggested that Ukraine could provide rare earth minerals in exchange for U.S. aid, a proposal Kyiv has been open to discussing.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-confirms-talks-with-putin-says-making-progress-on-ending-russias-war/	2025-02-10T01:16:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
China's Xi to visit Moscow for Victory Day celebrations, Russian envoy says	Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to visit Moscow on May 9 to attend Russia&apos;s Victory Day celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, pro-Kremlin media Interfax reported on Feb. 10, citing Russian Ambassador to Beijing Igor Morgulov. Morgulov also claimed that Xi invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to China to commemorate Japan&apos;s surrender and the conclusion of World War II. Beijing has not yet officially commented on these reports. China has strengthened ties with Russia since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, becoming Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of dual-use goods that bolster Russia&apos;s defense industry. The Kremlin uses Victory Day celebrations for propaganda purposes, showcasing its military might and drawing on the Soviet victory in World War II to justify its aggression against Ukraine. Putin has falsely accused Ukraine of fascist and Nazi tendencies, framing the invasion as an effort to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; the country &#x2014; rhetoric rooted in Russia&apos;s broader disinformation campaign. While China has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war, it has simultaneously criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying weapons to Ukraine. NATO has labeled China a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s aggression. North Korean soldiers will reportedly participate in Russia&apos;s Victory Day parade in Moscow for the first time, Japanese broadcaster NHK World reported in January. Slovakia&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico also said he had accepted Putin&apos;s invitation to attend the May 9 celebrations. Ukraine has distanced itself from Soviet-era commemorations. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 2023 law moving Ukraine&apos;s World War II remembrance day to May 8, aligning with most of Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-xi-to-visit-moscow-for-victory-day-celebrations-russian-envoy-says/	2025-02-10T00:28:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2179663881.jpg
2 killed, 16 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least two civilians and injured 16 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 10. Overnight, Russia launched 83 Shahed-type combat drones and decoy drones, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 61 drones over 11 oblasts, while 22 others were lost without causing damage. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed one resident of Kramatorsk, and 12 others were wounded in Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, one person was injured, and another was killed in Russian drone attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Sumy Oblast, a civilian was injured, and windows in four apartment buildings and 15 cars were damaged in Russian strikes, according to the region&apos;s military administration. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 32-year-old man was injured in a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack on the village of Liutivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, an 83-year-old woman suffered injuries to her arm during Russian shelling of the front-line town of Huliaipole, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine has endured daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities consistently reporting casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-16-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day-2/	2025-02-09T23:58:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-09_23-12-38.jpg
Drones reportedly target key Russian oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai	Drones attacked Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 10, reportedly targeting the Afipskiy oil refinery, a key facility processing 6.25 million tons of oil annually, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. The refinery, located roughly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the front line, is a strategic logistics hub for diesel fuel and aviation kerosene used by Russian troops, Kovalenko said. While other Ukrainian officials have not commented on the report, the strike would align with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to disrupt Russian fuel supplies and reduce Moscow&apos;s war funding. It is not immediately clear whether the refinery suffered significant damage in the attack. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev confirmed the drone attack against the region, saying that a residential complex in Krasnodar was hit. According to the governor, downed drone debris fell on a technical superstructure of a high-rise building, causing no casualties. The Russian Telegram channel Shot, close to Russian security forces, reported that residents heard powerful explosions around 2:00 a.m. local time, with eyewitnesses noting &quot;air defense activity&quot; near the Afipskiy refinery. Kovalenko emphasized the refinery&apos;s importance, claiming it provides fuel for Russian military equipment, particularly in southern Ukraine. &quot;That is why the Afipskiy refinery is not only an industrial facility but also an important element of Russia&apos;s military infrastructure,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues, a critical source of funding for its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-russian-oil-refinery-in-krasnodar-krai-key-fuel-hub-for-military/	2025-02-09T23:08:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-7_50_17-AM.jpeg
Zelensky, Vance to meet at Munich Security Conference, CBS News reports	Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President JD Vance are expected to meet during the Munich Security Conference later this week, CBS News reported on Feb. 9, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a quick resolution of Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine that nears its three-year mark. The U.S. delegation to the top European security conference, taking place between Feb. 14 and 16, will also include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg. Though the details of the expected Vance-Zelensky meeting have not been disclosed, Kellogg previously said that U.S. officials would talk in Munich about Trump&apos;s &quot;goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine.&quot; The retired general later denied media reports that he was planning to unveil Trump&apos;s strategy for ending the war during the event. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky in Washington the following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has also allegedly held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&#x2019;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-vance-to-meet-at-munich-security-conference-cbs-news-reports/	2025-02-09T22:39:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176025411.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 850,490 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 850,490 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 10. This number includes 1,170 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,001 tanks, 20,813 armored fighting vehicles, 36,638 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,879 artillery systems, 1,273 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,059 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,623 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-850-490-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-09T22:15:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Thousands of North Koreans taking construction jobs in Russia, media reports	Thousands of North Koreans entered Russia in 2024 to take jobs in construction, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 9. The report comes a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Moscow&apos;s key ally, pledged his country&apos;s unwavering support for Russia as it pursues its &quot;just cause&quot; in Ukraine. North Korea sent thousands of workers to take jobs at construction sites across Russia in 2024, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS). The move represents an apparent violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions passed in the wake of North Korea&apos;s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests. Russia is party to U.N. Resolution 2397, a 2017 decision that prohibits North Korea from sending its citizens to work overseas. Moscow and Pyongyang may be skirting the prohibition in the guise of student visas, Yonhap reported. According to data from Russia&apos;s federal statistics service, 13,221 North Koreans entered Russia in 2024 &#x2014;&#xA0;up 12 times from the previous year. Nearly 8,000 of those arrivals reportedly claimed to be entering the country for educational purposes. Russia has faced severe labor shortages as a consequence of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both military mobilization and the decreasing number of migrants entering the country have exacerbated the crisis, and Russia is heading into a drastic population decline over the next two decades. The 13,000 North Korean workers will not reverse Russia&apos;s economic downturn, but the recent arrivals may mark &quot;the beginning of larger influxes ... that could more significantly help Russia&apos;s labor shortage issues,&quot; analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote on Feb. 9. Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang also deepened in 2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin signing a mutual defense pact with Kim in June. Soon after, North Korea escalated its involvement in Russia&apos;s war from providing weapons &#x2014;&#xA0;including artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles &#x2014;&#xA0;to sending soldiers. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian troops in countering a Ukrainian incursion in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-of-north-koreans-taking-construction-jobs-in-russia-media-reports/	2025-02-09T21:14:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184920006.jpg
We need to recoup those costs' — Mike Waltz on future of US aid to Ukraine	United States National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Feb. 9 that U.S. officials will discuss the future of Washington&apos;s financial support for Ukraine during meetings in Europe this week. Waltz&apos;s comments come ahead of the Munich Security Conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. President Volodymyr Zelensky will head Ukraine&apos;s delegation, while the U.S. will be represented by Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, will also attend the conference. Waltz told NBC News that &quot;the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine&quot; was among President Donald Trump&apos;s priorities for the coming talks. &quot;We need to recoup those costs,&quot; Waltz said. &quot;And that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians, in terms of their rare earths, their natural resources, and their oil and gas, and also buying ours. Those conversations are going to happen this week.&quot; The future of U.S. aid to Kyiv has been murky since Trump won re-election in November with promises to swiftly end the war and get America &quot;out&quot; of the conflict. Previously approved weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have allocated any new military aid to Ukraine. In recent days, Trump has suggested that new aid shipments might depend on trade deals that the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. Trump said on Feb. 3 that he wanted to offer Ukraine weapons and aid in return for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Zelensky has said he&apos;s open to an arrangement that would grant U.S. companies access to Ukraine&apos;s reserves of rare earth minerals in exchange for Washington&apos;s continued support. Waltz also said that Europe would need to take on a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,&quot; he said. &quot;President Trump is going to end it, and then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.&quot; According to Waltz, Trump is prepared to impose sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;Russia&apos;s economy is not doing well. (Trump) is prepared to tax, to tarrif, to sanction. We need to get all sides to the table to end this war,&quot; he said. Trump has been engaging other world leaders in his efforts to bring about a ceasefire, Waltz said. He claimed that Trump has recently discussed the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and &quot;leaders across the Middle East.&quot; Waltz declined to comment on Trump&apos;s recent claim, reported in the New York Post, that he has personally discussed ending the war in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Waltz did not confirm or deny that such a conversation had taken place.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-to-recoup-those-costs-mike-waltz-on-future-of-us-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-09T19:02:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
EU should consider 'full trade embargo' on Russia, Estonian president says	The European Union should stop importing Russian energy products and &quot;seriously consider&quot; a complete trade embargo against Russia, Estonian President Alar Karis said on Feb. 9. Karis&apos; statement comes a day after the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected their energy systems from Russia&apos;s power grid, marking a historica shift away from Russian energy dependence and toward European integration. &quot;European Union should boost independence even further and end all Russian energy imports to the EU,&quot; Karis said in a post on X Feb. 9. &quot;We should even seriously consider a full trade embargo on Russia.&quot; In the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European countries took measures to significantly reduce their dependence on Russian energy products. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gasimports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027. Energy exports help fuel Moscow&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine, leading to calls among Kyiv&apos;s allies to phase out the purchases completely. Estonia has ranked among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion, offering humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Estonia has also pushed for harsher sanctions against Russia, including complete economic isolation. Ukraine imposed a full trade embargo on Russia in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-should-consider-full-trade-embargo-on-russia-estonian-president-says/	2025-02-09T17:13:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/P1390565_synced_00_09_35_21_Still002-1.jpg
Musk to reveal fraud, slash 'billions' at Pentagon, Trump says	Elon Musk will likely uncover billions of dollars in wasteful and fraudulent spending at the U.S. Defense Department, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 9. Musk, currently the world&apos;s richest man, heads the Trump-established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an organization tasked with eliminating waste from the federal budget. Trump praised Musk&apos;s work &#x2014;&#xA0;which has thus far included mass government layoffs and unprecedented cuts to humanitarian aid &#x2014;&#xA0;as &#xA0;&quot;terrific.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him very soon&#x2026; to go check the Department of Education. He&apos;s going to find the same thing. Then I&apos;m going to go into the military. Let&apos;s check the military,&quot; he told Fox News on Feb. 9. &quot;We&apos;re going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse, and the people elected me on that.&quot; The remarks come amid Trump and Musk&apos;s joint efforts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), America&apos;s chief foreign aid distributor. Musk has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization.&quot; USAID funds critical reconstruction efforts in Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. It also supports a range of humanitarian initiatives worldwide, such as clean water access, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. The Trump administration has frozen all foreign aid for 90 days and plans to lay off most of USAID&apos;s global workforce. While Trump and Musk have repeatedly denounced widespread fraud at the agency, they have not provided any evidence to support these claims. The White House has also taken steps in the last two weeks to dismiss government officials and replace them with Trump loyalists. Reuters reported in November 2024 that the Trump team wasalso &#xA0;preparing lists of names for mass dismissals at the Pentagon. Musk&apos;s attempts to slash funding at the Pentagon may further threaten the already tenuous future of U.S. military support for Ukraine. Previously allocated weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have approved new arms shipments to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-to-reveal-fraud-slash-billions-at-pentagon-trump-says/	2025-02-09T16:28:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418262-1.jpg
Kursk incursion stopped Russian invasion of Zaporizhzhia, Zelensky claims	Ukraine&apos;s offensive into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast prevented Russian forces from carrying out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with ITV News on Feb. 7. Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive. Speaking during an interview with the British outlet ITV News on the six-month anniversary of the incursion, Zelensky called the Kursk operation &quot;one of our most successful operations.&quot; The aim of the incursion was to create &quot;a buffer zone&quot; that would protect Ukraine&apos;s major northeastern cities, Kharkiv and Sumy, from another Russian offensive, Zelensky said. Russia launched a new assault against Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, advancing as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles) before Ukrainian troops halted the advance at the first line of defense. &quot;(T)he idea was to preventatively carry out an attack and create a buffer zone not on Ukrainian territory, but on Russia&apos;s territory in those regions,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s what happened.&quot; The Kursk incursion prevented Russia from fulfilling its operational goals in Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, while also providing Ukraine with nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers to replenish Kyiv&apos;s prisoner exchange fund, Zelensky said. It also prevented Russia from a southern offensive, he claimed. &quot;(T)hey withdrew their operational forces from the south of our country, because they were planning to attack Zaporizhzhia, this was their next operation after Kharkiv and Sumy, they were going to Zaporizhzhia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;So they were forced to give up their military units from the Zaporizhzhia direction and parts from the East.&quot; Russia redirected troops in these regions to Kursk Oblast, Zelensky alleged. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. Zelensky said on Nov. 25 that Ukraine was tracking Russian troop movement in the southern region, and had observed &quot;existing threats.&quot; While the military reported that Russian forces have deployed assault groups in the region, Moscow has not yet staged a large-scale offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, instead concentrating its attacks in eastern Ukraine. Parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast have been occupied by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion of 2022. The region remains a regular target of Russian aerial attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-incursion-stopped-russian-invasion-of-zaporizhzhia-zelensky-claims/	2025-02-09T15:31:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/ze.png
Ukraine to launch 'Drone Line' project to enhance battlefield operations	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 9 the launch of the &quot;Drone Line,&quot; a new military initiative aimed at integrating unmanned aerial systems into frontline operations. The project seeks to enhance combat effectiveness by expanding the use of drones within elite units of the Ground Forces and the State Border Guard Service. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov described the initiative as a transformative step in modern warfare, emphasizing that unmanned systems will play a central role in combat. &quot;This is the new standard of war, where unmanned systems become a key element of combat, helping our defenders carry out the most complex missions,&quot; Umerov said. The first phase of the project will focus on five elite regiments and brigades: the 20th Separate Regiment &quot;K-2,&quot; the 429th Regiment &quot;Achilles,&quot; the 427th Regiment &quot;RAROH,&quot; the 414th Brigade &quot;Magyar&apos;s Birds,&quot; and the &quot;Phoenix&quot; Regiment, which is part of the &quot;Pomsta&quot; Brigade. These units have already demonstrated effectiveness in drone warfare and will now see their capabilities significantly scaled up, according to the minister. By integrating infantry and UAVs into a unified strike system, the Drone Line aims to create a 10-15 kilometer deep kill zone, ensuring that enemy forces cannot move without sustaining heavy losses. &quot;This will fundamentally change battlefield tactics, giving our warriors a decisive advantage,&quot; Umerov said in his post on Facebook. The initiative will also provide constant aerial support for infantry and enhance target detection and destruction before adversaries reach Ukrainian positions. The Defense Ministry credited President Volodymyr Zelensky for spearheading the initiative and highlighted the ongoing work of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry in advancing drone technology.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-launch-drone-line-project-to-enhance-battlefield-operations/	2025-02-09T12:35:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186291789.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv says Russian Su-25 warplane downed in Donetsk Oblast, 70 Russian drones shot down overnight	Key developments on Feb. 8-9: Ukraine&apos;s military said on Feb. 8 that it had downed a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft near the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;One more Russian attack aircraft has been lost in the Toretsk direction thanks to our air defense troops,&quot; the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Telegram. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the brigade&apos;s report. The report comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold the front amid a grinding Russian offensive, facing severe manpower and resource shortages. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is fighting to retain its last strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, now nearly in its fourth year. The Soviet-designed Su-25, nicknamed &quot;Frogfoot&quot; by NATO, is a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft. It has seen extensive use by both sides in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi highlighted key military achievements during his first year in office, including long-range strikes, technological advancements, and NATO-standard training, in a Facebook post on Feb. 8. According to the statement, over the past year, Ukraine&apos;s defense forces successfully targeted 377 military sites in Russia, with attacks reaching as far as 1,700 km. &quot;DeepStrike&apos;s range deep into Russian territory has already reached 1,700 kilometers. We are preparing new long-range weapons, which will indeed be used,&quot; Syrskyi said. The Ukrainian Air Force and defense units also destroyed 9,200 air targets, more than doubling the previous year&#x2019;s total. Additionally, Ukraine has worked to modernize its military structure, introducing extended training programs of 1.5 months, and shifting foreign weapons training to Ukraine to optimize costs and efficiency. Syrskyi highlighted the transition to NATO standards in training, command, and troop management, reinforcing Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic alignment with Western military principles. &#x201C;The preservation of Ukrainian soldiers&apos; lives remains our top priority. To achieve this, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive program focused on modernizing the army, improving soldier training, and enhancing medical care at all stages,&#x201D; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Syrskyi to his position on Feb. 8, 2024, in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Prior to his appointment, Syrskyi served as the head of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces and commanded the Khortytsia Operational and Strategic Group fighting in eastern Ukraine. Following the full-scale invasion, he played a key role in the Battle of Kyiv, Ukraine&apos;s successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast in fall 2022, and the Battle of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military is planning to introduce &quot;special contracts&quot; to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. &quot;Combat brigades, experienced ones, together with the Defense Ministry have been working on a contract option for young people aged 18 to 24,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is for those who want to join up, it is not a mobilization.&quot; Such contracts will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; according to the president. He said the details of such contracts would be made public in the coming days. The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said in January that Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract young people exempt from mobilization. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. Ukrainian air defense shot down 70 Russian drones across the country overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Feb. 9. Drones were shot down over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 74 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Decoy drones are less deadly, but are much cheaper to manufacture and being combined with other drones in an attempt to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence service said last year. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall. These deadly attacks have forced civilians to live under constant threat and often target critical infrastructure in an attempt to knock out water, heating, or electricity services.

The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 10-Feb. 16. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. This week&#x2019;s key event is the 61st Munich Security Conference (MSC), taking place on Feb. 14-16. European defense, Europe-US relations, and Ukraine support/ ceasefire talks will take center stage (all major themes at a somewhat nervous Feb. 3 &#x201C;informal retreat&#x201D; of EU 27 + UK + NATO leaders; Ukraine was not invited). Special US Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg is expected to visit Kyiv, either before heading to Munich or &#x201C;later in February&#x201D; (note: while it would make sense for Kellogg to visit Kyiv before Munich, heartening Ukrainians and signaling a peace deal will not be made &#x201C;over their heads&#x201D;, we see some uncertainty) Kellogg stated that US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is developing a reliable plan to end the war within 100 days. Kellogg is expected to attend MSC (but not to present the plan, which is Trump&#x2019;s prerogative), together with Vice-President JD Vance (he will travel there from the AI Action Summit on Feb. 10-11 in Paris) and possibly the US president himself. (note: This year&#x2019;s MSC comes just a week before snap elections in Germany, which could influence ongoing German support for Ukraine.) Earlier, the European Parliament will hold a plenary session in Strasbourg on Feb. 11 on maintaining the EU&#x2019;s unwavering support for Ukraine, which is awaiting a vote. The session will review ongoing and future commitments across military, economic, and humanitarian assistance and Ukraine&#x2019;s EU accession process Key topics expected are additional weapons deliveries, long-term security assistance, joint procurement of ammunition and air defense systems, and legal and political challenges to using Russian assets held within the EU to finance Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction. MEPs will also discuss renewing the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology between the EU and Ukraine. The agreement facilitates joint research projects, knowledge exchange and funding opportunities between Ukrainian and EU institutions. Renewal would ensure continued access to collaborative scientific initiatives. The &#x201C;Ramstein summit&#x201D; of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) is expected to take place on Feb. 12 in London under the chairmanship of the UK (rather than the US, likely a signal of US disengagement from Europe). UDCG includes over 50 countries (incl. all 32 NATO members). It previously met at the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany If you have an upcoming event that you would like featured in our newsletter, please get in touch via insights@kyivindependent.com.

Explosion on oil tanker at Russian port prompts investigation	An explosion occurred on an oil tanker at the Ust-Luga port in northwest Russia in the morning of Feb. 9, prompting an evacuation of the crew, according to the country&apos;s Federal Agency for Sea and Inland Water Transport (Rosmorrechflot). Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident. Rosmorrechflot reported on Telegram that the blast took place in the engine room of the Koala, a vessel docked at the port west of St. Petersburg. While the explosion forced crew members to leave the ship, officials said that no oil spill or cargo leak had occurred. The ship was not at risk of sinking, they added. The incident follows a series of tanker-related accidents in recent months. In December, two oil tankers were wrecked in the Black Sea, causing a large fuel spill that continues to wash up along the shoreline. The tanker, built in 2023 and sailing under the Antigua and Barbuda flag, had arrived at Ust-Luga on Feb. 6, according to ship-tracking data from Vesselfinder. Russia&#x2019;s Baza Telegram channel reported that the vessel was carrying 130,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. Authorities have not yet disclosed the cause of the explosion, and the ship&apos;s condition is set to be inspected. The U.S. government in January designated over 180 Russian vessels as part of a &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to export crude oil despite Western sanctions. However, the Koala is not included in this list. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s security services claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a fuel terminal at Ust-Luga, describing the port as a hub for Russia&#x2019;s sanctioned oil and gas exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-on-oil-tanker-at-russian-port-prompts-investigation/	2025-02-09T10:05:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
Musk calls for shutting down US-funded outlets Radio Free Europe, Voice of America	Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Feb. 9 called for shutting down U.S.-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Responding to comments by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions Richard Grenell, Musk wrote on X: &quot;Yes, shut them down. Europe is free now (not counting stifling bureaucracy). Nobody listens to them anymore. It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.&quot; &quot;Radio Free Europe and Voice of America are media outlets paid for by the American taxpayers. It is state-owned media. These outlets are filled with far left activists,&quot; Grenell reportedly said on Feb. 9. &quot;I&#x2019;ve worked with these reporters for decades. It&#x2019;s a relic of the past. We don&#x2019;t need government paid media outlets.&quot; Both Elon Musk and Richard Grenell have voiced strong opposition to government funding of media organizations, arguing that taxpayer money should not be used to support these outlets. Musk, as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has criticized federal payments to media organizations like Politico, the Associated Press, and The New York Times, deeming them inefficient uses of taxpayer funds and moving to eliminate them. Similarly, Grenell, as Trump&#x2019;s special mission envoy, has publicly condemned government spending on media subscriptions, echoing Musk&apos;s stance that such funding should be terminated immediately. These calls come amid broader scrutiny and controversy surrounding government-funded media, with the Trump administration taking steps to halt subscriptions to outlets like Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-calls-for-shutting-down-us-funded-outlets-radio-free-europe-voice-of-america/	2025-02-09T09:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196638354.jpg
German military investigates unidentified drones flying over German military bases where Ukrainians train, media reports	Germany&apos;s Bundeswehr is investigating potental espionage after unidentified drones were spotted six times in January flying over a sensitive German military base where Ukrainians have been training, Der Spiegel reported on Feb. 9. Germany failed to force the drones to land or to locate their pilots despite the use of special jamming devices, the Der Spiegel report said. The &#xA0;Schwesing base is located in the North Sea and has been used to train both Germans and Ukrainians on the Patriot air defense system. These advanced weapons systems have played a crucial role in defending Ukraine&apos;s skies from missile and drone attacks, which have drastically increased over the past several months. The Bundeswehr believes Russia is the top suspect behind the drone flights, said Der Spiegel, referencing an internal report on the matter. Incidents of drones believed to be spying on German bases where Ukrainians train have been reported for over a year. In December, Germany charged three German-Russian citizens with espionage on behalf of Moscow, after the suspects were said to have photographed and explored potential targets in Germany for sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-military-investigates-unidentified-drones-flying-over-german-military-bases-where-ukrainians-train-media-reports/	2025-02-09T07:45:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-158520585-1.jpg
Ukraine gas imports remain high after infrastructure attacks, Reuters reports	Ukraine is maintaining high levels of gas imports from the EU after a series of Russian missile attacks on its gas facilities, according to a Reuters report on Feb. 9. Ukraine imported 16.3 million cubic meters on Sunday, Reuters said, citing data provided by the operator of the state-run gas transmission system. The gas appeared to come from Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in western Ukraine. Earlier in the week, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. He declined to provide figures on the severity of the impact. At the beginning of this year, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers using Ukraine&apos;s pipelines. The deal had expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-gas-imports-remain-high-on-sunday/	2025-02-09T07:37:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/344739975_907645373861326_5870873476025670998_n.jpg
Ukraine's ambassador to Poland gives more details on Volyn exhumation plans	Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Bodnar, said on Feb. 8 that the preparations for the exhumation of remains of Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy are underway. Speaking in an interview with Polish TV channel TVN24, Bodnar said that exhumation will begin in the spring, but that the exact time will depend on the weather. Work is already underway to determine all the locations in Poland and Ukraine where exhumations will need to be carried out, he said, according to Ukrainian media. The Volyn tragedy, also known as the Volyn massacres, took place in 1943 in Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) killed tens of thousands of poles. Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed by Polish military in retaliation. The topic of the massacres and the long-unresolved dispute over exhumation of the remains have strained relations between the two allies. Poland repeatedly raised the issue as a potential roadblock to Ukraine&apos;s desire to join the EU, before Speaker of the Polish Parliament Szymon Holownia walked back these statements in September. A breakthrough on the issue was announced in January, when the two countries agreed to begin first exhumations of the victims. Later in the month, Polish media said that the exhumations would begin in April. According to Bodnar, Ukrainian legislation requires a licensed Ukrainian company to carry out the exhumations. A Polish partner for the project has been identified, he said. While Poland is providing the majority of the funding, Ukraine is also financing part of the project, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-ambassador-to-poland-gives-more-details-on-volyn-exhumation-plans/	2025-02-09T06:50:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-24-at-2.52.23-PM.png
Russian drone strike injures 2 in Nikopol, governor says	A Russian kamikaze drone injured two men in Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Feb. 9, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on Telegram. The victims, ages 41 and 39, suffered varying degrees of injuries, according to Lysak. &quot;One of them sustained an explosive mine injury and a shrapnel wound to the face. He will be treated as an outpatient. The other is hospitalized in serious condition,&quot; he wrote. A gas station and a car were also damaged in the attack, Lysak said. Nikopol, located on the banks of the destroyed Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-injures-2-in-nikopol-governor-says/	2025-02-09T05:27:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-09-15_02_02.jpeg
70 Russian drones shot down overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian air defense shot down 70 Russian drones across the country overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Feb. 9. Drones were shot down over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Volyn, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 74 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Decoy drones are less deadly, but are much cheaper to manufacture and being combined with other drones in an attempt to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence service said last year. Since the end of last year, Russia has sharply escalated the number of drones attacks launched at Ukraine. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall. These deadly attacks have forced civilians to live under constant threat and often target critical infrastructure in an attempt to knock out water, heating, or electricity services.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-shooting-down-70-russian-drones-overnight/	2025-02-09T03:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Trump wants Ukraine's 'rare earths'	The following is the Feb. 4, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. President Donald Trump came out on Feb. 3 saying he wanted to make a deal with Ukraine by giving the war-torn country weapons and aid in return for its &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he said. It&#x2019;s not quite clear what exactly Trump meant by &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; Ukraine is home to all sorts of highly sought-after raw materials from critical minerals to rare earth elements. What&#x2019;s more clear is why Trump wants them. China controls 70% of global rare earth mining capacity and 90% of processing capacity. Having easy access to these materials could boost the U.S.&#x2019;s competitiveness &#x2014; something at the top of the new president&#x2019;s &#x201C;America First&#x201D; agenda. For Kyiv&#x2019;s part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has positioned Ukraine&#x2019;s natural materials as part of a peace plan. Reports late last year said Zelensky&#x2019;s team had even delayed a deal on critical materials with former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s team so it could offer it to Trump in case he won the elections. So what critical resources does Ukraine actually have and how viable are they, really? Ukraine has 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals like titanium used in the aerospace and defense industries and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. Ukraine also possesses rare earth elements &#x2014; under which titanium and lithium do not fall &#x2014; such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Demand for these materials has jumped in recent years as the world shifts to renewable forms of energy. Rare earth elements are crucial for making the powerful magnets used in wind turbine generators. The issue, however, is geography. Raw materials are unevenly distributed across Ukraine and around $12 trillion has ended up in Russian-occupied territory, according to SecDev, a global digital risk and resilience firm. And there&#x2019;s the fact that a lot of these mineral deposits are underdeveloped, with the total value unknown, according to an analysis from the Kyiv School of Economics. Existing estimates put the value of Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals anywhere between $3-$26 trillion. Read reporter Dominic Culverwell&#x2019;s full article here. Ukrainian then-President Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 17, 2010. (Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images)Making millions off stolen Ukrainian resourcesSpeaking of critical resources. Oleksandr Yanukovych, the son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, has made billions selling coal from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories to Turkey, independent Russian investigative outlet Important Stories reported on Feb. 4. Viktor Yanukovych was Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin president from 2010 to 2014 before fleeing to Russia with his family in the wake of the EuroMaidan Revolution. In October 2024, reports emerged that Oleksandr Yanukovych had been granted Russian citizenship. The company behind the coal exports, Energoresurs, is registered in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, and has exported nearly half a million tons of coal abroad between 2023 and 2024. Journalists linked Energoresurs to Oleksandr Yanukovych through his coal holdings and mining enterprises. According to the investigation, the firm sources coal from suppliers in occupied Donbas and transports it to Turkey by rail and sea. The coal is reportedly sold to an offshore company, Energy Union, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Energoresurs sells the coal at a significantly low price &#x2014; an average of $60 per ton in 2024 &#x2014; allowing the company to minimize export duties before reselling it at a higher price on international markets. A Huless tethered drone system. (Brave1/LinkedIn)Ukrainian drone maker attracts $1 millionHuless, a Ukrainian company developing tethered drone systems, secured over $1 million in private financing, loans, and a grant from Ukrainian Defense Tech cluster Brave1, the company said in a press release on Jan. 30. Huless makes the Highline-T, a drone that can operate for up to four hours at heights up to 100 meters, even without GPS signals, the company says. Unlike kamikaze or bomber drones that blow up Russian positions or vehicles, the Highline-T&#x2019;s main function is to carry radio equipment that boosts the operational range of other drones and remote-controlled ground vehicles. The tethered drone stays connected to the ground via a cable that provides constant power and data connection independent of interference from electronic warfare. Huless plans to use the funding to expand its market presence and develop its tethered drone technology for military communications, the company said. A bakery worker sifts flour to bake bread in Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 16, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)Front-line lifelineOne of the oddities of Russia&#x2019;s war has been the parallel realities that coexist, almost seamlessly: on the one side are daily air raid sirens, Russian attacks, and casualties, on the other, people grabbing coffee, children going to school, businesses growing. Nowhere are these two starkly divergent realities more clear than near the front lines. Reporter Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko took a trip to the front-line town of Druzhkivka, located just 15 kilometers from the embattled city of Chasiv Yar to talk to the local entrepreneurs and businesses that remain despite the dangers. In one scene in Sekretarenko&#x2019;s article, taxi driver Serhiy Pohrebnyakov sits calmly behind the wheel of his car waiting for customers as explosions go off and people around begin running in different directions for cover. Beyond the services or goods they provide &#x2014; taxi rides, baked bread, and shampoo and razors for soldiers at roadside kiosks &#x2014; these small businesses contribute to a semblance of normalcy in their community amid all the devastation wrought by Russia.

Poor harvests and higher wages amid labor shortages are currently driving the rising inflation, according to the bank. Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% year-on-year in December 2024, surpassing the bank&#x2019;s earlier projections. After peaking in the middle of the year and cooling to 8.4% by year&#x2019;s end, the bank expects inflation to reach a target 5% in 2025. Ukraine&apos;s largest private delivery company Nova Poshta invested Hr 1.8 billion ($43 million) to expand its Ukrainian network in 2024, a 35% increase from 2023, the company said on social media. The company opened 1,747 new branches across Ukraine and installed 8,410 self-service delivery package lockers in 2024, bringing the total number of its service points across the country to 37,210. Within the last six months, 93 companies in Ukraine have removed signs of Russian ownership and continue to do business in the country, despite a moratorium on altering the registration of companies with Russian owners, the monitoring service Opendatabot reported. The monitoring service also found that some of these companies have participated in the Ukrainian public procurement tenders. Ukraine&#x2019;s State Property Fund announced an auction to privatize the state-owned Radiorele plant in Kharkiv &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s largest switching equipment manufacturer, the fund said on Feb. 3. Radiorele produces low-current, miniature, electromagnetic switches, and relays, which are used to control voltage, current, and temperature in electrical systems. The plant has been put up for auction in the past but has so far been unable to attract a buyer. The auction, which is for a 100% stake in the plant, will be held on Feb. 4. Its starting price is Hr 234.4 million ($5.6 million), which includes debts for the last six months.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 12	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 12 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 27&#x2013;Feb. 2, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukrainian Government approves Ukrposhta&#x2019;s plan to establish a bank The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has approved the transfer of shares in First Investment Bank, formerly owned by Russian stakeholders, to the Community Development Ministry, with plans for subsequent ownership by state postal operator Ukrposhta. The decision, made on Jan. 28, paves the way for Ukrposhta to launch its own bank by 2025. According to Ukrposta, the planned postal bank will not engage in large-scale corporate lending or high-risk foreign exchange transactions. Instead, it will focus on providing basic financial services to rural and front-line communities, addressing financial inclusion gaps in underserved regions. After extensive discussions with international partners, such conditions for establishing a bank based on Ukrposhta were included in the text of Ukraine&#x2019;s memorandum with the IMF. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to resume legislative work on Feb. 11 Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada will hold a session on Feb. 4 to formally open its new legislative term, though no decisions are expected, as the meeting is a constitutional requirement. The first plenary week, during which lawmakers will debate and vote on key legislation, is scheduled to begin on Feb. 11. However, it remains uncertain whether lawmakers will consider two key bills &#x2014; the repeal of the &#x201C;Lozovyi amendments&#x201D; and the creation of the High Administrative Court. Both are structural benchmarks under Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF memorandum. Ukraine meets another milestone under the Ukraine Facility program President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed into law Bill #12131, which introduces a system for monitoring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation fulfills one of the key requirements under Ukraine&#x2019;s financial assistance plan within the Ukraine Facility program. Kyiv was expected to meet this condition by the end of the second quarter of 2025 as part of its broader commitments to European integration and environmental governance. Zelensky backs Defense Minister amid defense procurement dispute President Zelensky voiced support for Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in an ongoing dispute with the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). &#x201C;The defense minister has the right to do everything necessary to prevent any delays in supplies,&quot; Zelensky stated In his recent interview for Associated Press. The president&#x2019;s comments follow concerns raised by Ukraine&#x2019;s international partners. Earlier on Feb. 3, G7 ambassadors urged Kyiv to resolve the situation at the DPA, emphasizing the importance of adhering to good governance principles and NATO recommendations to maintain public and international trust. The dispute escalated after the DPA&#x2019;s Supervisory Board decided to extend the contract of its head, Maryna Bezrukova, for another year. However, the Defense Ministry refused to approve the decision, leading to her removal. Arsen Zhumadilov was appointed as interim director. Over the past week, the leadership of the DPA has changed six times in the official registry, highlighting the ongoing turmoil in the agency&#x2019;s management.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-12/	2025-02-09T03:02:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-843323892.jpg
Trump says he spoke with Putin about ending war in Ukraine, New York Post reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine but declined to say how many times they had spoken, the New York Post reported on Feb. 8. Trump also claimed that Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if he had been president in 2022. He told the New York Post, which interviewed him aboard Air Force One, that he &quot;always had a good relationship&quot; with Putin. Trump said he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, &quot;I hope it&#x2019;s fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.&quot; He also said he believes Putin &quot;does care&quot; about the deaths on the battlefield. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he could not confirm or deny whether Trump had spoken with Putin. Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have emphasized their desire for a swift resolution to the war. On Feb. 7, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they hoped to end the war &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; The administration had previously set a goal of reaching a resolution within the first 100 days of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Also on Feb. 7, Trump said he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky next week in Washington. Zelensky has said Ukraine&#x2019;s security is his priority in any negotiations and that it is crucial for him to meet with Trump before any talks with Putin. &quot;It is very important. Otherwise, it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters in an interview published Feb. 7. &quot;It is still important for partners to discuss their issues first and then have a conversation with the enemy.&quot; Trump has also stated that Washington wants access to Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-spoke-with-putin-about-ending-war-in-ukraine-new-york-post-reports/	2025-02-09T01:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg

Russia says it sees no progress on disarmament talks with US, media reports	Russia has yet to see any positive developments from the new U.S. administration regarding disarmament, Russia&#x2019;s permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, said on Feb. 9. He noted that while Moscow remains open to cooperation, there has been no progress within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, an international forum that has previously negotiated key arms control agreements. Gatilov reiterated Russia&#x2019;s willingness to maintain stable relations with the U.S. administration but emphasized that Washington has yet to take concrete steps toward resuming arms control discussions. &quot;We expect that the Americans will move from words to action, especially since they have made numerous statements on the matter since January 20,&quot; he told Russian state media. The remarks come as Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed hope that Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House could usher in a new phase in U.S.-Russia relations. Both leaders have indicated interest in an in-person meeting, with Trump emphasizing his intention to end the war in Ukraine. Despite these signals, nuclear arms control discussions between Moscow and Washington remain stalled. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems for both countries, is set to expire on Feb. 5, 2026. With no active negotiations to extend or replace it, the treaty remains the last major nuclear arms control agreement between the world&#x2019;s two largest nuclear powers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sees-no-progress-on-disarmament-talks-with-us-media-reports/	2025-02-08T19:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1826910292--1-.jpg
Russia says its undersea telecom cable in Baltic Sea damaged by 'external impact'	Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled telecom giant Rostelecom announced on Feb. 8 that one of its underwater cables in the Baltic Sea had been damaged due to an &quot;external impact.&quot; The company did not specify the cause of the damage but confirmed that repair work was underway. Rostelecom said that the incident did not affect consumers, according to AFP. The damage comes amid a series of recent disruptions to undersea telecom and power cables in the Baltic Sea. Western experts and officials have accused Russia of engaging in hybrid warfare against countries supporting Ukraine. On Jan. 30, Norwegian authorities detained the Silver Dania vessel with a Russian crew on suspicion of damaging an undersea fiber-optic cable linking Latvia and Sweden. NATO has responded by increasing patrols to safeguard critical underwater infrastructure. On the same day, Finland&apos;s coast guard reported that a Russian vessel was conducting repairs on a damaged underwater cable in the Gulf of Finland. Finnish authorities confirmed that the incident took place within Finland&#x2019;s exclusive economic zone but did not provide details on how or when the damage occurred. In response to growing concerns over subsea security, NATO launched a patrol mission in January to protect vital infrastructure in the region. The operation, called &quot;Baltic Sentry,&quot; involves aircraft, frigates, submarines, and drones monitoring the area for potential threats. Similar incidents have been reported in the past when Finnish authorities discovered damage to another Rostelecom cable in the Baltic Sea. That incident coincided with disruptions to underwater infrastructure in both Sweden and Finland, further raising suspicions of deliberate sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-says-its-undersea-telecom-cable-in-baltic-sea-damaged-by-external-impact/	2025-02-08T18:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
NATO military chair visits Ukraine, discusses continued support with Zelensky	NATO Military Committee Chair Giuseppe Cavo Dragone met with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 8 during his visit to Ukraine. The two toured a long-range weapons plant and held a meeting to discuss ongoing military assistance. Ukraine has relied on NATO in its defense against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine consistently voices its intentions to join the military alliance and regularly holds visits and summits with NATO leaders. Zelensky and Dragone met to discuss preparations for the next Ramstein format meeting and Ukraine&apos;s defense needs. &quot;We are grateful to NATO for its support of Ukraine from the very beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. Thank you very much for your first mission and decision to be in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky and Dragone discussed strengthened coordination of military assistance within the Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) framework, a command plan designed to allocate and coordinate military assistance to Ukraine. &quot;The message I would like to convey not only to you but to everyone is that NATO is on your side. We are determined to fulfill all our commitments and to defend all the values and principles that we share,&quot; Dragone said on Feb. 8. Dragone and Zelensky further discussed direct investment in Ukrainian arms production following the &quot;Danish model&quot; of financing in a visit to a long-range missiles plant.

UK announces $31 million social recovery aid package for Ukraine	The UK is allocating 25 million pounds ($31 million) to launch a social recovery initiative in Ukraine called the SPIRIT program, the British government announced on Feb. 8. Announced during Foreign Secretary David Lammy&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, the program is a collaboration between the UK, Ukraine&#x2019;s government, UNICEF, and the World Bank. Through the funding, the support will &#x201C;help Ukraine to meet the varied needs of the population, and accelerate Ukraine&#x2019;s Euro-Atlantic pathway,&#x201D; the statement read. The SPIRIT initiative will concentrate on three key priorities: expanding access to quality social services, with at least 10,000 families in ten regions benefiting; establishing an Office of Social Recovery under Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Social Policy to coordinate reforms and international partnerships; and launching cross-sectoral initiatives in health, economy, and social services to support vulnerable groups. The program will also provide small grants and training for 100 civil society and local community representatives to expand service delivery and create a sustainable social support system. With a focus on women, families with children, people with disabilities, the elderly, and veterans, SPIRIT aims to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s institutional capacity to manage the social and economic challenges caused by the war. &#x201C;Investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s social systems is an investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s people - and we know that Ukraine&#x2019;s people are its greatest resource,&#x201D; Martin Harris, UK Ambassador to Ukraine, said of the program.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-31-million-social-recovery-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-02-08T13:47:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162001991.jpg
Syrskyi marks first year in office by highlighting key achievements, including strikes on 377 military targets in Russia	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi highlighted key military achievements during his first year in office, including long-range strikes, technological advancements, and NATO-standard training, in a Facebook post on Feb. 8. According to the statement, over the past year, Ukraine&apos;s defense forces successfully targeted 377 military sites in Russia, with attacks reaching as far as 1,700 km. &quot;DeepStrike&apos;s range deep into Russian territory has already reached 1,700 kilometers. We are preparing new long-range weapons, which will indeed be used,&quot; Syrskyi said. The Ukrainian Air Force and defense units also destroyed 9,200 air targets, more than doubling the previous year&#x2019;s total. Additionally, Ukraine has worked to modernize its military structure, introducing extended training programs of 1.5 months, and shifting foreign weapons training to Ukraine to optimize costs and efficiency. Syrskyi highlighted the transition to NATO standards in training, command, and troop management, reinforcing Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic alignment with Western military principles. &#x201C;The preservation of Ukrainian soldiers&apos; lives remains our top priority. To achieve this, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive program focused on modernizing the army, improving soldier training, and enhancing medical care at all stages,&#x201D; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Syrskyi to his position on Feb. 8, 2024, in place of Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Prior to his appointment, Syrskyi served as the head of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces and commanded the Khortytsia Operational and Strategic Group fighting in eastern Ukraine. Following the full-scale invasion, he played a key role in the Battle of Kyiv, Ukraine&apos;s successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast in fall 2022, and the Battle of Bakhmut.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-marks-first-year-in-office-by-highlighting-key-achievements-including-strikes-on-377-military-targets-in-russia/	2025-02-08T11:36:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
North Korea to start drone production in collaboration with Russia, media reports	North Korea is expected to begin drone production this year with Russian technical assistance, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported on Feb. 8, citing undisclosed sources. The agreement will allow North Korea to develop and mass-produce several types of drones in coordination with Russia. According to the sources, the drone production initiative is likely a reciprocated gesture to North Korea after the country has sent soldiers to support Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. This cooperation follows last year&#x2019;s strategic partnership treaty between the two countries. Artyom Lukin of Russia&apos;s Far Eastern Federal University, previously told Reuters that the agreement is &quot;for all intents and purposes... a pact of military alliance,&quot; Moscow&apos;s &quot;first defense alliance outside the post-Soviet space.&quot; The agreement also covers trade, investment, political and security cooperation. As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers were fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, according to Budanov. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-to-start-drone-production-in-collaboration-with-russia-media-reports/	2025-02-08T09:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157616618.jpg
Military to introduce 'special contracts' to motivate younger volunteer fighters, Zelensky says	The Ukrainian military is planning to introduce &quot;special contracts&quot; to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 24, who are exempt from mobilization, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. Currently, Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 are subject to conscription. &quot;Combat brigades, experienced ones, together with the Defense Ministry have been working on a contract option for young people aged 18 to 24,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is for those who want to join up, it is not a mobilization.&quot; Such contracts will have many benefits, including &quot;a very high monetary provision,&quot; according to the president. He said the details of such contracts would be made public in the coming days. The U.S. has reportedly advocated for lowering the conscription age as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. Trump&apos;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz said in January that Ukraine &quot;could generate hundreds of thousands of new soldiers&quot; if it lowered its conscription age to 18. The Ukrainian military faces a critical manpower shortage, struggling to replenish infantry gaps left by heavy losses in battle-hardened brigades. Enlisting in the military currently often means signing up until the war ends, with no end in sight. A one-year contract option would appeal to those interested in contributing to the war effort for a limited period. Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said in January that Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract young people exempt from mobilization. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. Kyiv has long opposed U.S. pressure to lower the draft age, with Zelensky arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-special-contract-for-mobilization-exempt-18-24-year-olds-to-be-presented-soon/	2025-02-08T08:59:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
ICC prosecutor who oversaw arrest order for Putin over Ukrainian children deportation included in Trump's nonpublic sanction list, Reuters reports	International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, who oversaw the court&apos;s arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over Moscow&apos;s deportation of Ukrainian children, was named in the U.S.&apos; as-of-now nonpublic economic and travel sanctions list, Reuters reported on Feb. 7. British national Khan is the first to be targeted under the sanctions authorized by newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump that &quot;target the war crimes tribunal over investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies,&quot; Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. In its report, it said, citing sources including a senior ICC official, that Khan was named in the executive order that Trump signed on Feb. 6. &#xA0; Russia included Khan on a wanted list in 2023 after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and another Russian official, Maria Lvova-Belova, for &quot;unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Khan&apos;s sanctions would mean prohibiting him and his family from entering the U.S., as well as the freezing of their U.S. assets. Khan&apos;s regular trips to the U.S. to brief the United Nations Security Council are part of the U.N.-Washington agreement, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/icc-prosecutor-who-oversaw-arrest-order-for-putin-over-ukrainian-children-deportation-included-in-trumps-unpublic-sanction-list-reuters-reports/	2025-02-08T08:34:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197645700.jpg
Scholz says talk of German peacekeepers in Ukraine 'premature and inappropriate'	Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a Feb. 8 interview that discussions over Germany potentially deploying its peacekeeping troops to Ukraine are &quot;premature and inappropriate.&quot; He told the German newspaper RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) that &quot;first there needs to be an end to the conflict and real negotiations,&quot; and only then it would be possible to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;I find such debates inappropriate and premature,&quot; Scholz told RND. &quot;Because it is assumed that Ukraine will not get parts of its territory back from Russia.&quot; The Telegraph reported in November that, under one of the peace plans being considered by U.S. President Donald Trump, he might call on British and other European troops to enforce a buffer zone that the president would attempt to establish in place of the current front line in Ukraine. The comments come as Ukraine struggles to hold the front line amid relentless Russian offensives in the east. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is increasingly on the back foot, especially in Donetsk Oblast, as it scrambles to gather manpower and resources to defend its last strongholds there. The future of Western military aid remains as uncertain as ever with the return of Trump, a Ukraine skeptic who says he is determined to push both sides into negotiations to end the war. &quot;In any case, Ukraine will have an army that it will not be able to pay for with its financial means alone, and that is where we and all of Ukraine&apos;s friends will be called upon,&quot; Scholz told RND. In January, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the German opposition party Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said that Berlin should not rule out deploying its troops to Ukraine after the war ends, German newspaper Schw&#xE4;bische Zeitung reported. His remarks came as the U.K. and France considered sending their own troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-calls-discussion-over-germany-potentially-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-post-war-ukraine-premature-and-inappropriate/	2025-02-08T07:42:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147904710.jpeg
Ukraine says it downed Russian Su-25 warplane in Donetsk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s military said on Feb. 8 that it had downed a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft near the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;One more Russian attack aircraft has been lost in the Toretsk direction thanks to our air defense troops,&quot; the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade said on Telegram. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the brigade&apos;s report. The report comes as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold the front amid a grinding Russian offensive, facing severe manpower and resource shortages. Losing one town after another, Kyiv is fighting to retain its last strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, now nearly in its fourth year. The Soviet-designed Su-25, nicknamed &quot;Frogfoot&quot; by NATO, is a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft. It has seen extensive use by both sides in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-downed-russian-su-25-warplane-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-08T07:00:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1234099297.jpeg
Security guarantees for Ukraine 'main issue' in talks with Trump, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Feb. 7 interview that security guarantees for Ukraine are the &quot;main issue&quot; he seeks to discuss with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said on Feb. 7 that he may meet Zelensky next week in Washington. In an interview with Reuters published on Feb. 7, Zelensky stressed that it was important for him to meet Trump first before he holds talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;It is very important, otherwise it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters. &quot;It is still important for partners to discuss their issues first, and then have a conversation with the enemy.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come as Ukrainian troops gradually withdraw across the front, struggling with critical manpower shortages and resource constraints. The future of Western military aid remains as uncertain as ever with the rise of Ukraine skeptic Trump to power as Kyiv&apos;s most powerful ally. The Ukrainian leader has long taken a firm &apos;no&apos; stance on any negotiations with Russia. Kyiv emphasizes that Moscow easily breaks promises and that talks have failed over more than 10 years of war. &quot;We have absolutely everything for this - we need peace,&quot; Zelensky told Reuters. Zelensky also commented on Kyiv&apos;s earlier offer to to buy and store liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S. in Ukraine. &quot;It is very interesting for us, I know it&apos;s very interesting for the Trump administration,&quot; he said. &quot;We are ready and willing to have contracts for LNG supplies to Ukraine. And of course, we will be a hub for the whole of Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-security-guarantees-main-issue-to-discuss-with-trump/	2025-02-08T06:08:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Baltic countries disconnected from Russia's power grid	Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected their energy systems from Russia&apos;s electric power grid on Feb. 8 in &quot;another historic day for European integration,&quot; the Estonian Foreign Ministry said. &quot;This legacy of occupation meant that Moscow - which uses energy as a weapon - had control of the frequency,&quot; the ministry said in a statement on X. &quot;That&#x2019;s a critical element in maintaining reliable power supply. That dependency ends today!&quot; The Lithuanian Energy Ministry said in July 2024 that the Baltic countries would fully synchronize with the continental European electricity grid in February 2025. &#xA0; Earlier in February, Latvian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said in an interview that his country is ready for technical difficulties and possible sabotages during the synchronization process. Ukraine also disconnected itself from the Russian energy grid in February 2022, when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. &quot;We stopped buying electricity &amp; gas from Russia right after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,&quot; the Estonian Foreign Ministry said in its Feb. 8 statement. &quot;By making our whole energy system independent of Russia, the Kremlin loses another lever of power to use against Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-countries-exit-russias-energy-grid/	2025-02-08T04:29:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197714501.jpg
Air Force reports shooting down 67 Russian drones overnight	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on Feb. 8 that air defense had shot down 67 Russian Shahed and other drones across the country overnight. The drone attack targeted Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Odesa oblasts, the Air Force said on Telegram. The Air Force also said that it had lost track of 71 decoy drones launched during the attack alongside the combat drones, saying that there were &quot;no negative consequences.&quot; Russia has launched daily drone attacks against Ukraine, forcing civilians &#x2014; even in cities far from the front line &#x2014; to live under constant threat. The drones have often targeted critical infrastructure, sometimes leaving people without water, heating, or electricity. In November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops were launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones at Ukraine compared to the previous fall.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-shooting-down-67-russian-drones-overnight/	2025-02-08T02:54:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/shahed-2.jpg
Russia claims 36 Ukrainian drones downed, oil refinery attacked	An oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast was among the targets of a Ukrainian overnight drone strike on Feb. 8, Russian local authorities claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 36 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by air defense. These include 18 drones over Rostov Oblast, 11 over Volgograd Oblast, five over Belgorod Oblast, and two over Krasnodar Krai. Volgograd Oblast Governor Andrei Bocharov said on Telegram on Feb. 8 that the air defense had intercepted a Ukrainian drone strike on an oil refinery in the Kumylzhenskaya District, over 200 kilometers northwest of Volgograd. Bocharov said no fire had erupted from the falling debris, and no casualties or damage were reported. Despite being on the back foot on the front line, Ukrainian troops have begun to actively strike deep into Russia using their homemade drones, often targeting military sites, oil refineries, and air fields.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-down-36-ukrainian-drones-local-authorities-say-oil-refinery-targeted/	2025-02-08T01:33:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1489472156.jpeg

End war 'as quickly as possible' — US defense secretary outlines Ramstein aims	The United States has a key message for the upcoming Ramstein-format summit in Brussels: end the war in Ukraine &quot;as quickly as possible,&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 7. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will convene on Feb. 12, with the U.K. replacing the U.S. as host for the first time. It is also the group&apos;s first meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. Hegseth will attend the UDCG summit as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagon statement published Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to &quot;reiterate President Trump&apos;s commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,&quot; the statement read. &quot;He will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.&quot; The UDCG includes more than 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members. Formed in April 2022, the coalition coordinates international military aid to Ukraine, typically meeting at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. At the previous Ramstein summit, discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defenses and bolstering domestic defense production. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense, and some of Ramstein&apos;s former functions have already been transferred to NATO control. Trump has also signaled ambivalence regarding ongoing U.S. military aid to Kyiv and has repeatedly promised to secure a swift &quot;deal&quot; to end the war. Previously allocated weapons packages from the U.S. are about to run out, and neither Trump nor Congress have approved new arms shipments to Ukraine. While Kyiv&apos;s best hopes for continued U.S. military assistance may lie in a possible rare earth elements deal, European allies have pledged to ramp up their support for Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Feb. 7 that the upcoming Ramstein summit will yield important decisions on air defense systems and investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, was confirmed as defense secretary on Jan. 24, after U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tie-breaking vote to secure his appointment. Hegseth was among Trump&apos;s most controversial nominees, both due to inexperience and multiple allegations of professional misconduct and sexual assault.	https://kyivindependent.com/end-war-as-quickly-as-possible-us-defense-secretary-outlines-ramstein-aims/	2025-02-07T21:21:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196790881.jpg
Trump's pick for FBI chief took money from Russian propagandist, WP reports	Kash Patel, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 7. A number of Trump&apos;s nominees and allies have faced scrutiny for their apparent support of Russia amid the full-scale war against Ukraine. Patel received the $25,000 payment from Global Tree Pictures, Lopatonok&apos;s Los Angeles-based company, according to financial disclosures submitted as part of his nomination process and seen by the WP. The payment came after Patel participated in a documentary about Trump that aired on TCN, the online network of right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson. Lopatonok holds U.S-Russian dual citizenship and has produced numerous projects advancing pro-Kremlin narratives. Though born in Ukraine, Lopatonok has made films criticizing the EuroMaidan Revolution and appeared on a red carpet alongside pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk, a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was detained by Ukrainian authorities on charges of treason in 2022 and later exchanged in a prisoner swap with Russia. Lopatonok has also claimed Russian state media directors and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko as his supporters, the WP reports. In 2023, Lopatonok helmed a project titled &quot;To Russia With Love&quot; that aimed to circulate pro-Russian videos online. The influence campaign reportedly receive $31,000 in funds from a foundation established by Putin. Patel partnered with Lopatonok on a documentary series called &quot;All the President&apos;s Men,&quot; which portrayed Patel and other figures from Trump&apos;s first term as victims of a conspiracy aimed at undermining the president. The series was broadcast on the online network &#xA0;of Tucker Carlson, who has also frequently spouts Kremlin propaganda narratives and infamously interviewed Putin in Moscow last year. &#xA0; In the documentary, Patel says that Russia is not among the &quot;true enemies&quot; of the U.S. He also promises to &quot;shut down the FBI headquarters building and open it up as a museum to the deep state.&quot; Patel is a Trump loyalist who, if confirmed as FBI director, would hold one of the top positions in the administration. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent in November 2024, U.S. national security expert Evelyn Farkas described Patel as one of Trump&apos;s &quot;yes men.&quot; &quot;Kash Patel, for example, is a guy who also seems to have no principles, only wants power and has a sense of grievance like Trump, so he&apos;s willing to do whatever it takes to make Trump happy,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pick-for-fbi-chief-took-money-from-russian-propagandist-wp-reports/	2025-02-07T19:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196773597.jpg
US federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's efforts to suspend USAID staff	A United States federal judge on Feb. 7 imposed a temporary restraining order on U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s plans to place thousands of employees at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on administrative leave. Before the temporary block, over 2,000 USAID staffers had been set to go on administrative leave at midnight. The &quot;very limited&quot; restraining order covers the the pending employee suspensions as well as &quot;the accelerated removal of people from their countries,&quot; Judge Carl Nichols said following a hearing in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Earlier on Feb. 7, Trump called for the immediate closure of the agency, writing &quot;CLOSE IT DOWN!&quot; on the platform Truth Social. A notice posted on USAID&apos;s website informed staff that all the agency&apos;s direct hires worldwide would be placed on administrative leave as of Feb. 7, 11:59 p.m. The announcement said the agency would pay for their return to the U.S. within 30 days, with limited case-by-case extensions available. Unions representing USAID workers filed for a temporary restraining order to block the surprise suspension, arguing that Trump&apos;s efforts to dismantle the agency are &quot;unconstitutional and illegal.&quot; During the hearing, Judge Nichols, a Trump appointee, asked Acting Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate to explain why the layoffs were so urgent. Shumate said that Trump had determined there was fraud and corruption at USAID, without providing any evidence. Trump has targeted USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, from his first days in office. His administration has ordered a three-month freeze on nearly all international development funding and reportedly plans to lay off most of the agency&apos;s global workforce. The White House has repeatedly accused USAID of widespread waste and fraud, even though foreign aid comprises only 1% of the federal budget. The administration earlier this week placed the agency under the control of the State Department. Crews were seen on Feb. 7 removing the USAID signage from the front of the agency&apos;s headquarters in Washington. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency&apos;s progromas help to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, repair critical energy infrastructure, and fund civil society initiatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-efforts-to-suspend-usaid-staff/	2025-02-07T17:44:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Putin acknowledges inflation as key challenge for Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Feb. 7 that inflation remains a major challenge for the country&#x2019;s economy and directed the government to develop measures to lower it in 2025. Speaking at a televised meeting with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Putin noted that consumer prices in Russia rose by 9.5% in 2024 and have climbed further to 9.9% year-on-year this month, according to the Moscow Times. Putin reportedly emphasized the need for &quot;balanced growth&quot; and reiterated his expectation for the government to present a plan to address inflation and advance structural economic changes. &quot;The task for this year is to reach a balanced growth trajectory, to reduce inflation,&quot; he said, according to a Kremlin transcript. Mishustin reported that the Russian economy grew by 4.1% in 2024, revising an earlier estimate of 3.6% for 2023 to match the latest figure. However, he agreed with Putin that inflation was the biggest concern. The Russian Central Bank recently said that it sees &quot;no signs of a sustainable slowdown in price growth&quot; despite maintaining a high key interest rate of 21%. The regulator pointed to Western sanctions, the ruble&#x2019;s depreciation, and a weak harvest as key inflationary pressures. Additionally, increased defense spending is driving demand beyond the economy&#x2019;s capacity to supply goods and services. The Central Bank forecasts inflation to ease to a range of 5.2% to 8.6% by the end of 2025. Its next rate meeting is scheduled for Feb. 14, where policymakers will assess further measures to stabilize the economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-inflation-as-key-challenge-for-russia/	2025-02-07T16:54:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
US sanctions strain Russia’s oil exports as shipping costs surge, Bloomberg reports	Russia is facing a significant oil transportation crisis due to recent U.S. sanctions, according to Bloomberg oil strategist Julian Lee. On Jan. 10, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 161 oil tankers involved in transporting Russian crude, adding to a series of measures imposed by the Biden administration. These restrictions, which President Donald Trump has yet to relax, have already caused a sharp increase in shipping costs for Russian oil exports. The impact of these sanctions is evident in the rising cost of securing tankers to transport Russia&#x2019;s Urals crude to Asia. Data from Argus Media shows a nearly 50% surge in freight rates since the measures took effect. The difference between the price of Russian oil at export and its delivered price in Asia&#x2014;an indicator of shipping costs&#x2014;has also spiked. The number of sanctioned vessels has now reached 265, with U.S. blacklisting proving to be the most disruptive. Of the 435 ships that transported Russian crude in 2024, 112&#x2014;or 26%&#x2014;are now under Washington&#x2019;s sanctions, according to Bloomberg. When vessels sanctioned by the EU and U.K. are included, the figure rises to 37%. However, given that 80% of these tankers carried multiple shipments, the affected vessels were responsible for 57% of Russia&#x2019;s total seaborne crude exports last year. This presents a significant logistical hurdle for the Kremlin as it struggles to secure alternative shipping options. The growing restrictions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet mean the country must find new ways to sustain its oil export volumes. Some sanctioned ships have already encountered delays, either idling near Russian ports or waiting outside Chinese terminals instead of completing deliveries. Others have been used to transfer cargo to larger storage vessels near Russia&#x2019;s coastline. Freight costs have already surged, with the expense of shipping a barrel of Russian crude from the Black Sea to India now at $10, while transport from the Baltic costs as much as $13 per barrel. While these rates are not yet at the peak levels seen after the initial G7 price cap, they have jumped by 48% since Jan. 10. With Russian oil shipments becoming increasingly difficult, the country&#x2019;s ability to maintain its export levels may come under serious strain. If the recent shipping bottlenecks continue to expand, the sanctions could deal a severe blow to Russia&#x2019;s energy trade, exacerbating its economic challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-strain-russias-oil-exports-as-shipping-costs-surge-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-07T15:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229695308.jpg
Trump demands USAID shutdown as mass suspensions, layoffs begin	President Donald Trump called on Feb. 7 for the immediate closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), just hours before most of its staff faced suspension or layoffs. Writing on Truth Social, Trump accused the agency of widespread corruption and fraud, declaring, &quot;CLOSE IT DOWN!&quot; He had previously described USAID as being &quot;run by radical lunatics.&quot; The call to shut down USAID coincided with an expected wave of administrative leave notices and contract terminations. Most direct hires at the agency were set to be placed on indefinite leave, while contractors faced layoffs. A notice posted on USAID&#x2019;s website informed foreign service officers that the agency would pay for their return to the United States within 30 days, with limited case-by-case extensions available. Overnight, the agency modified its guidance, allowing foreign service officers to remain overseas at their own expense. A newly added FAQ on the USAID website clarified that those who chose to stay abroad would have to cover their own travel costs. However, it remained unclear whether they would continue receiving cost-of-living subsidies while on administrative leave. The abrupt changes left many foreign service officers scrambling to determine their next steps. The initial directive sparked widespread concern, as aid workers questioned how they could relocate their families on such short notice. The revised policy, while permitting them to stay, offered little reassurance to those facing potential job losses. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-demands-usaid-shutdown-as-mass-suspensions-layoffs-begin/	2025-02-07T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Let's do a deal' — Zelensky tells Reuters he's open to Trump's mineral partnership	President Volodymyr Zelensky is pushing for a deal with the United States that would grant American companies access to Ukraine&#x2019;s vast reserves of rare earth minerals in exchange for continued financial and military support. During an interview with Reuters on Feb. 7, Zelensky examined a once-classified map detailing the country&#x2019;s mineral wealth, highlighting its strategic importance. He emphasized that any agreement must include security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. The proposal aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s interest in securing Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earths and other critical minerals as part of ongoing support for Kyiv. Zelensky stressed that Ukraine was not offering to &quot;give away&quot; its resources but seeking a mutually beneficial partnership. &quot;The Americans helped the most, and therefore the Americans should earn the most,&quot; he said, adding that he hoped to discuss the issue directly with Trump. He also noted that Moscow had extensive knowledge of Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral wealth from Soviet-era geological surveys. According to Zelensky, less than 20% of Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources are under Russian occupation, including about half of its rare earth deposits. He warned that Russian allies such as North Korea and Iran could exploit these resources, reinforcing the urgency of securing Western investment. Ukraine holds Europe&#x2019;s largest reserves of titanium&#x2014;crucial for the aeronautics and space industries&#x2014;as well as significant uranium deposits. Zelensky also raised the prospect of using Ukraine&#x2019;s underground gas storage facilities to store U.S. liquefied natural gas, positioning the country as a key energy hub for Europe. Zelensky is set to attend the Munich Security Conference from Feb. 14-16, where he hopes to meet Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. He insisted that any U.S.-Russia discussions must include direct Ukrainian participation. &quot;Otherwise, it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine,&quot; he said. The Ukrainian leader said his priority would be securing firm commitments on security guarantees before any negotiations with Moscow move forward. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have launched a new offensive in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, advancing 2.5 km (1.5 miles). Zelensky also confirmed that thousands of North Korean troops fighting for Russia had returned to active combat after a brief pause.	https://kyivindependent.com/lets-do-a-deal-zelensky-tells-reuters-hes-open-to-trumps-mineral-partnership/	2025-02-07T13:31:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013695.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean soldiers 'brought in again' to fight in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Key developments on Feb. 7: North Korean soldiers were &quot;brought in again&quot; by Russia to the embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Feb. 7. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi briefed Zelensky about new Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine had launched a new offensive in the Russian region. &quot;A significant number of occupiers have been eliminated, we are talking hundreds of Russian and North Korean servicemen,&quot; the president said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Ukraine&apos;s spy chief Kyrylo Budanov denied these reports. He said that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;A total of 60,000 Russian troops in Kursk Oblast are 60,000 that have not replenished the already significant occupier&apos;s forces in Pokrovsk and other sectors in our Donetsk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian guided aerial bomb near the front-line southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Feb. 7, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told Interfax-Ukraine. Guided aerial bombs (KABs), while having a shorter range than missiles, are cheaper to produce and are launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. They are nearly impossible to shoot down because they have heavy iron structures, and come in extremely fast from high altitudes, unlike cruise missiles or drones, according to experts. According to Ihnat, it was not the first time Ukraine downed a guided bomb. &quot;To counter this threat, we need a comprehensive approach &#x2014; both the use of ground-based air defense and aviation components to drive the carriers of these KABs as far as possible,&quot; the spokesperson said, without specifying how the target was shot down. His remarks came after Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian soldiers had down the guided aerial bomb on the morning of Feb. 7, allegedly using experimental weaponry. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security on Feb. 7 refuted media reports of Russia&apos;s alleged failed launch of its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, at Ukraine. The statement came after Forbes, citing Ukrainian soldier and blogger Kyrylo Sazonov, wrote that Russia launched another Oreshnik missile on Feb. 6 &quot;apparently targeting Kyiv.&quot; Sazonov claimed that the missile &quot;didn&apos;t fly far&quot; and exploded in Russia. &quot;The article in the U.S. media is based only on Sazonov&apos;s assumptions, not on actual data,&quot; the statement, published by the center that operates under Ukraine&apos;s Culture and Information Ministry, read. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially reported the launch of Oreshnik. U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to double down on the sanctions against Russia to pressure the Kremlin into ending its war against Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told The New York Post in an interview published on Feb. 6. According to Kellogg, current U.S. sanctions on Russia, particularly those targeting its energy sector, amount to a &quot;3 on a 10-point scale&quot; regarding economic pressure. He argued there is significant room to strengthen them further. &quot;You could really increase the sanctions &#x2014; especially the latest sanctions (targeting oil production and exports),&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;It&apos;s opened the aperture way high to do something.&quot; He added that Trump has already gathered his national security team, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to discuss a coordinated strategy to end the war. Kellogg criticized former President Joe Biden&apos;s approach of supporting Ukraine &quot;as long as it takes,&quot; calling it &quot;a bumper sticker, not a strategy.&quot; Kellogg emphasized that Trump&apos;s administration is focused on a &quot;holistic approach&quot; to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Trump&apos;s special envoy is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7.

Zelensky, Trump may meet in Washington next week	President Volodymyr Zelensky may meet with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump next week in Washington, Trump said on Feb. 7. &quot;I will probably be meeting with President Zelensky next week, and I will probably be talking to President (Vladimir) Putin. I&apos;d like to see the war end,&quot; said the American leader during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. He also said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments but added that no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. Trump and Zelensky are discussing Ukraine&apos;s underground rare earths and &quot;other things,&quot; according to the U.S. president. Previously, Trump said that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. Kyiv is open to mining with its partners, Zelensky said. It&#x2019;s unclear exactly what Trump meant by &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; Ukraine is home to 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals, like titanium, used in the aerospace and defense industries, and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. &quot;We want security. Because as you know, Europe is putting up much less than us (the U.S.),&quot; Trump said. The meeting between Zelensky and Trump can take place as the U.S. prepares to present a long-awaited plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that the plan will be introduced by Trump, but did not specify a timeline.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-may-meet-in-washington-next-week/	2025-02-07T11:36:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2173926361.jpg

As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers were fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, according to Budanov. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-brought-in-again-in-kursk-oblast-battles-zelensky-said/	2025-02-07T11:29:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599341.jpg
Russia designates Register of Damage against Ukraine as undesirable organization	Russia&#x2019;s Justice Ministry declared the Register of Damage Caused by Russian Aggression against Ukraine an &quot;undesirable organization&quot; on Feb. 7. This was announced on the Russian Justice Ministry&#x2019;s website. The register, established under the Council of Europe and based on a UN General Assembly resolution, aims to document war-related damage as a step toward compensating victims. This designation applies to foreign and international NGOs that Russian authorities view as a threat to national security or constitutional order. The Russian government designated a record 65 organizations as &quot;undesirable&quot; in 2024. There are now 187 organizations categorized as &quot;undesirable&quot; by the Russian government.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-designates-register-of-damage-against-ukraine-as-undesirable-organization/	2025-02-07T11:05:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-06-10.08.15.jpeg
Trump's ICC sanctions won't hinder Russian war crimes investigation, Kyiv says	The International Criminal Court (ICC) will continue to carry out its functions in holding Russia accountable for crimes committed during the full-scale war against Ukraine, regardless of U.S. sanctions, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Feb. 7 briefing. Tykhyi&apos;s statement came after President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on the ICC over probes targeting the U.S. and Israel. He ordered an asset freeze and a travel ban on the court&apos;s officials, staff and their families, as well as anyone who is believed to have assisted the ICC in its investigation. &quot;I think that the U.S. decisions are not related to the Ukrainian context, and we hope that they will not affect the court&apos;s ability to achieve justice and justice for the victims of Russian aggression,&quot; Tykhyi said. According to the spokesperson, Kyiv continues to work with the ICC to ensure that the investigation of Russian war crimes advances. Ukraine became the 125th state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Jan. 1. In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced deportations of at least tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-occupied territories. The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council who formerly served as defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for war crimes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/mks-prodovzhit-rozsliduvati-rosiiski-zlochini-v-ukrayini-pislia-sanktsii-trampa-kiyiv-kazhie/	2025-02-07T10:09:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
2 Ukrainian military officers appointed as deputy defense ministers	Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers appointed two new deputy ministers of defense on Feb. 7, Taras Melnychuk, the Cabinet&apos;s representative in parliament, announced. The deputy ministers are Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk and Captain Valerii Churkin. &quot;These decisions are part of a comprehensive approach to strengthening our Armed Forces, modernizing management, and advancing military technology,&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. The appointment came a week after Umerov faced backlash following his decision to fire Maryna Bezrukova, head of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). The minister replaced her with Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director, despite the agency&apos;s supervisory board voting to extend her contract days earlier. Umerov also dismissed Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov and two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr. In late January, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power, as well as office position by Umerov. Described as &quot;one of the most experienced officers&quot; in the Ukrainian army, Moysiuk served as the Air Assault Forces commander and was deputy to former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Moysiuk as special commissioner on implementation of the international security agreements. He will be in charge of the development of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, including mobilization and military training, Umerov said. Churkin, who joined the Armed Forces at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, is the head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Scaling Technology Solutions. As deputy defense minister, he will focus on defense innovations and technological development of the Ukrainian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-officers-appointed-as-umerovs-deputies/	2025-02-07T09:06:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648104571.jpg
Ukraine expecting important decisions at Ramstein meeting, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is actively preparing and expects important decisions to be made at the upcoming Ramstein meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a press conference on Feb. 7. London will host the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) summit in Brussels on Feb. 12, rather than the U.S., the U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO confirmed on Feb. 6. &#x201C;We welcome that the British have now taken on this role of convening the Ramstein,&#x201D; Tykhyi said. He stated that decisions will likely be made about both air defense and investments in Ukrainian weapons production during the meeting. &#x201C;We consider the Ramstein to be an effective mechanism, an effective format that has proven its effectiveness over the years 2022-2024. Therefore, it is good that it continues to function,&#x201D; Tykhyi added. The UDCG, which includes more than 50 countries&#x2014;including all 32 NATO members&#x2014;typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Its last gathering on Jan. 9 marked the 25th meeting since the group was established in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expecting-important-decisions-at-ramstein-meeting-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-02-07T08:51:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1252040987.jpg
Police investigate death of 32-year-old man at military enlistment office	Chernivtsi Oblast&apos;s police said on Feb. 7 that they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a 32-year-old man at a regional military enlistment office. He was wanted for evading mobilization and agreed to visit the enlistment office to clarify his military registration details, according to the police. According to preliminary information, the man felt unwell and fainted during his medical examination. Police said they immediately provided first aid and called paramedics, but despite resuscitation efforts, doctors pronounced him dead at the scene. His body was sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of death. The incident follows reports on the deaths of conscripts allegedly caused by beatings at military enlistment offices. In June 2024 the Zhytomyr Oblast military enlistment office launched an investigation after Serhii Kovalchuk, 32, died following his stay at the Zviahel military enlistment office. Kovalchuk&apos;s relatives accused the military enlistment office of causing his death by beating him. Dozens of local residents protested against the enlistment office following the incident. Prosecutors opened a murder investigation into the incident. Military enlistment officials have denied the accusations, claiming that no violence was used against Kovalchuk. The incidents also come amid heightened security concerns following a series of attacks on military enlistment offices. On Feb. 1, a bombing at a draft office in Rivne killed the suspected perpetrator and injured eight service members. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later said Russia had recruited the attacker. Other recent attacks include explosions at recruitment centers in Rivne and Pavlohrad, which wounded several officers, and the Jan. 31 killing of a draft officer in Poltava Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have pledged to investigate the incidents and bring those responsible to justice.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-investigate-death-of-32-year-old-man-at-chernivtsi-recruitment-center/	2025-02-07T08:36:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/360088567_230475339937093_4720614111518600125_n.jpg
Kyiv denies reports of an alleged failed Russian Oreshnik missile launch at Ukraine	Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security on Feb. 7 refuted media reports of Russia&apos;s alleged failed launch of its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, at Ukraine. The statement came after Forbes, citing Ukrainian soldier and blogger Kyrylo Sazonov, wrote that the Russia has launched another Oreshnik missile on Feb. 6 &quot;apparently targeting Kyiv.&quot; Sazonov claimed that the missile &quot;didn&apos;t fly far&quot; and exploded in Russia. &quot;The article in the U.S. media is based only on Sazonov&apos;s assumptions, not on actual data,&quot; the statement, published by the center that operates under Ukraine&apos;s Culture and Information Ministry, read. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially reported the launch of Oreshnik. Russia launched the Oreshnik against Ukraine once following Kyiv&apos;s first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia last November. Moscow later acknowledged additional ATACMS strikes on targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts. The missile, launched at Dnipro, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that only a few air defense systems can repel the Oreshnik, and Ukraine does not yet possess these capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-denies-reports-of-an-allegedly-failed-russian-oreshnik-missile-launch-at-kyiv/	2025-02-07T08:00:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Bucha massacre suspect becomes top official in Russian region	Nursultan Mussagaleyev, a former Russian army commander suspected of involvement in war crimes, has been appointed as an acting deputy minister for regional and information policy in Russia&apos;s Orenburg Oblast, Denis Pasler, the region&apos;s governor, said on Telegram on Feb. 6. As a platoon commander at the 76th Airborne Assault Division, Mussagaleyev allegedly participated in Russia&apos;s brutal occupation of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, in February and March 2022, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Hundreds of civilians were massacred by Russian troops in Bucha at the time. The SBU has identified him as having taken part in so-called &quot;purge operations,&quot; which aimed to suppress resistance and intimidate civilians. Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, became a symbol of Russian war crimes after mass graves were uncovered in April 2022 following its liberation by Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has documented over 1,400 civilian killings in the Bucha District, including 637 in Bucha itself. Among the victims were 37 children. Many were executed, their bodies left on the streets or buried in mass graves. Mussagaleyev was later honored by Russia&apos;s military and political leadership. He was awarded the &quot;Hero of Russia&quot; star and the &quot;Military Distinction&quot; medal. Russian state television glorified his role in the invasion, broadcasting a feature about him on the state-run Russia 1 channel. His appointment to a government position in Orenburg Oblast follows a broader trend in Russia of rewarding military personnel linked to war crimes with prestigious roles in civilian administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/bucha-massacre-suspect-appointed-to-deputy-minister-in-russias-orenburg-oblast/	2025-02-07T07:43:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2022-04-img-9105-1024x663.jpg
A night with Ukraine’s Vampire drone team near Kurakhove	In the new age of drones ushered in by Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, UAVs of all shapes and sizes, from large fixed-wing reconnaissance drones to small kamikaze quadcopters have a specialized role to play. One design, the Ukrainian Vampire heavy bomber drone, has stood out in its effectiveness and versatility, able to drop not only large bombs and mines on the enemy, but also much-needed supplies for Ukrainian troops. The Kyiv Independent spent a night shift with a Vampire team fighting between Kurakhove and Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the hottest part of the front line, on a mine-laying mission.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-night-with-ukraines-vampire-drone-team-near-kurakhove/	2025-02-07T07:08:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5273895809975342109.jpg
Russia to expand seizure of foreign assets, Reuters reports	The Russian government is planning to expand its authority to seize the frozen assets of companies and investors from countries that have sanctioned Moscow over its war against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 7, citing sources familiar with the matter. A draft law approved this week by the Russian government&apos;s legislative commission lays out the procedure for seizing foreign property in retaliation for freezing Russian assets abroad. The legislation follows a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May 2024, which allows the government to identify U.S. property and securities as compensation for losses caused by Western asset freezes. The process would involve lawsuits filed by the Russian authorities, including the central bank and the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A source told Reuters that C-type accounts &#x2014; holding funds belonging to foreign investors but blocked unless authorized by Moscow &#x2014; could be at risk. This could impact individuals and large U.S. investment funds with billions of dollars trapped in Russia. The move comes as the U.S. and European allies seek to use frozen Russian assets to finance aid for Ukraine. The U.S. government is considering using proceeds from these assets to purchase American weapons for Kyiv, Trump administration envoy Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Jan. 24. Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, though they can only access an estimated $3.2 billion in annual profits. These earnings will help finance a $50 billion G7 loan to Ukraine, with the European Union contributing &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) to the initiative and the U.S. adding $20 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-advancing-legal-changes-to-confiscate-western-assets-reuters-reports/	2025-02-07T07:03:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Ukraine downs Russian guided bomb near Zaporizhzhia, Air Force says	Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian guided aerial bomb near the front-line southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Feb. 7, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told Interfax-Ukraine. Guided aerial bombs (KABs), while having a shorter range than missiles, are cheaper to produce and are launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. They are nearly impossible to shoot down because they have heavy iron structures, and they come in extremely fast and from high altitudes, unlike cruise missiles or drones, according to experts. According to Ihnat, it was not the first time Ukraine downed a guided bomb. &quot;To counter this threat, we need a comprehensive approach &#x2014; both the use of ground-based air defense and aviation components to drive the carriers of these KABs as far as possible,&quot; the spokesperson said, without specifying how the target was shot down. His remarks came after Telegram channels reported that Ukrainian soldiers had down the guided aerial bomb on the morning of Feb. 7, allegedly using experimental weaponry. Russia regularly attacks Ukrainian front-line settlements with guided bombs. Over the past week, a total of 760 such bombs were launched at Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Russian glide bombs killed 360 Ukrainian civilians in 2024, and injured 1,861, a threefold increase in fatalities, and a sixfold increase in injuries compared to 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-4/	2025-02-07T06:59:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193050137.jpg
Syria to reassess Russian military presence 'based on national interests,' may seek Assad's extradition	Syria&apos;s new government will decide the fate of Russian military bases based on national interests, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told The Washington Post on Feb. 6. Russia&apos;s ability to retain its naval base in Tartus and airbase in Khmeimim will depend on what Moscow offers in return, Abu Qasra indicated. &quot;If we benefit Syria from it, yes,&quot; he said. Following the overthrow of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. The new government has reportedly requested that Russia hand over Assad and his close aides, Reuters reported on Jan. 28, citing a Syrian source familiar with the negotiations. The demand was raised during initial talks between Syrian officials and a Russian delegation, which took place shortly after Assad fled to Moscow. While Abu Qasra did not confirm whether transitional President Ahmad al-Sharaa formally asked for Assad&apos;s extradition, he noted that any future relations with Russia must serve Syria&apos;s interests first. Relations between Moscow and Syria&apos;s new government have &quot;significantly improved,&quot; the defense minister said, despite Russia&apos;s past support for Assad, including airstrikes against opposition forces during their rapid advance on major cities in late 2024. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to bolster Assad&apos;s regime, which used Moscow&apos;s backing to suppress opposition through mass imprisonment, torture, and executions. During the Jan. 28 talks, Syria&apos;s new leadership pressed Russia to acknowledge &quot;past mistakes&quot; and offer compensation, but the Russian delegation refused to concede, according to a Reuters source. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new government on the issue. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi later said Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on Russia&apos;s military presence, though details were not disclosed. Given al-Sharaa&apos;s past ties to al Qaeda, Western officials have remained cautious about the transitional president&apos;s intentions as he attempts to rebuild a war-torn society. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X on Jan. 27, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-to-reassess-russian-military-bases-may-demand-assads-extradition/	2025-02-07T06:30:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187892433.jpg
Zelensky to push for 'lasting and sustainable peace' at Munich conference	President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead Ukraine&apos;s delegation to the Munich Security Conference next week, Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. Yermak noted that the Ukrainian delegation will present the country&apos;s position on ending the war and its vision of achieving a &quot;lasting and sustainable peace.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s necessary that the leaders and the experts in politics who will be in Munich realize that this is momentum. That we are very near to really ending this war by a just and lasting peace, but (it&apos;s) necessary to be together,&quot; he told the Associated Press. The Munich Security Conference will also be attended by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. While Bloomberg reported on Feb. 5 that Trump&apos;s team might present a peace plan, Kellogg denied this on Feb. 6, saying that no such plan would be unveiled in Munich. Ukraine is preparing to host Kellogg on Feb. 20, following the Munich conference, according to sources in the President&apos;s Office cited by RBC-Ukraine. The annual conference comes at a pivotal moment for Ukraine. Kyiv strives to establish a relationship with the new U.S. administration, a key partner during the nearly three-year Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-lead-ukrainian-delegation-at-munich-security-conference-push-for-lasting-and-sustainable-peace/	2025-02-07T06:26:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukraine secures preliminary deals to replace USAID funding for critical projects, official says	Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects. She also noted that the European Commission and Group of Seven (G7) countries are expected to announce a decision on resuming the work of commissions responsible for appointing key members of Ukraine&apos;s judiciary and anti-corruption institutions in the coming days. Due to the suspension of USAID&apos;s operations in Ukraine, several commissions involved in judicial selections have either halted work or faced operational issues. &quot;As far as I know, the contracts have been terminated, and we must reassemble this puzzle,&quot; Stefanishyna said, stressing the need for international partners to uphold their joint responsibility in supporting Ukraine&apos;s reforms. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Trump&apos;s administration is reportedly planning to eliminate most positions at USAID, The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Trump appointed as acting administrator of USAID, reiterated on Feb. 4 that U.S. foreign aid must serve American interests rather than function as &quot;charity.&quot; Billionaire Elon Musk, now head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump agreed to shut it down.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-preliminary-deals-to-replace-usaid-funding-for-critical-projects-senior-official-says/	2025-02-07T06:13:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166979167.jpg
37 Ukrainian MPs visit US to strengthen bilateral relations, speaker says	Thirty-seven Ukrainian lawmakers have traveled to the United States at their own expense to strengthen ties with U.S. officials, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said on Feb. 7. &quot;Ukraine is facing a critical task &#x2014; to restart our relations with our strategic partner, the United States. And we are doing this systematically at all levels, including restoring relations with the U.S. Congress,&quot; Stefanchuk said. His comments come after President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 6 criticized lawmakers for frequent foreign trips, including a visit to the U.S. for the National Prayer Breakfast. Stefanchuk emphasized that the delegation, composed of both opposition members and representatives from the ruling party, is working with U.S. senators to rebuild political relationships. &quot;All the lawmakers are there not at the expense of the state; they went at their own expense,&quot; Stefanchuk said. He assured that the work of the Verkhovna Rada would not be disrupted, noting that parliamentary duties extend beyond voting in plenary sessions to include committee work, investigations, and diplomatic engagement. Amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s current parliamentary convocation has been operating longer than any in the country&apos;s history.	https://kyivindependent.com/37-ukrainian-lawmakers-visit-us-to-strengthen-strategic-relations-stefanchuk-announces/	2025-02-07T05:52:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1722127186.jpg
Bulgaria to receive $519 million compensation for Ukraine military aid	Bulgaria will receive around 500 million euros ($519.5 million) from Kyiv&apos;s biggest donors in compensation for its military aid to Ukraine, the European news site Euractiv reported on Feb. 7. &quot;By helping Ukraine, we are actually helping ourselves,&quot; Bulgarian Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov said. Sofia has already received 174 million euros ($180 million) from Denmark under two contracts related to military aid for Ukraine. Authorities expect at least another 300 million euros ($311 million) from the U.S. and the European Commission as compensation for sending military equipment to Kyiv. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with old Soviet-era military equipment, with funds received from NATO and EU allies being reinvested into purchasing modern Western weapons. The country had already sent six military aid packages, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and defective air defense missiles that can be used for spare parts, Zapryanov said. While the Bulgarian government does not disclose specific details about what is being sent, it is known that a significant portion consists of ammunition and missiles for Ukraine&apos;s S-300 air defense systems. In 2024, Bulgaria also sent 150 armored vehicles and Soviet-made &quot;Gvozdika&quot; self-propelled howitzers. Despite the financial and strategic benefits for Bulgaria&apos;s military, pro-Russian forces in the country continue to oppose sending aid to Ukraine. Kostadin Kostadinov, leader of Bulgaria&apos;s pro-Russian Revival party, echoed Kremlin narratives on Jan. 11, claiming that Southern Bessarabia, part of Ukraine&apos;s Odesa Oblast, should be &quot;returned&quot; to Bulgaria. Posting on Facebook, Kostadinov argued that &quot;Ukraine is falling apart&quot; and that Bulgarians are the &quot;indigenous population&quot; of the region, with historical ties predating Ukraine&apos;s control of the territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/actually-helping-ourselves-bulgaria-to-receive-519-million-compensation-for-ukraine-military-aid/	2025-02-07T05:14:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Three killed, five injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least three civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 7. Overnight, Russia launched 112 Shahed combat drones and decoy drones, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 81 drones over nine oblasts, while 31 others were lost without causing damage, according to the Air Force. In Kherson Oblast, Russian shelling killed one person and wounded five others, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Two high-rise buildings and six private houses were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, a Russian attack destroyed a two-story apartment building, the regional military administration said. Preliminary reports indicate that two people were killed, with their bodies found during rubble removal. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces carried out 339 strikes on 14 settlements. The attacks damaged apartments, private homes, and vehicles, though no civilian casualties were reported, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian troops launched seven attacks on localities, damaging over 14 buildings. No casualties were reported, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Ukraine has endured daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities consistently reporting casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-killed-5-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-07T04:23:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-07_08-51-07.jpg
Trump ready to step up Russia sanctions to end war in Ukraine, special envoy says	U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to double down on the sanctions against Russia to pressure the Kremlin into ending its war against Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told The New York Post in an interview published on Feb. 6. According to Kellogg, current U.S. sanctions on Russia, particularly those targeting its energy sector, amount to a &quot;3 on a 10-point scale&quot; regarding economic pressure. He argued there is significant room to strengthen them further. &quot;You could really increase the sanctions &#x2014; especially the latest sanctions (targeting oil production and exports),&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;It&apos;s opened the aperture way high to do something.&quot; He added that Trump has already gathered his national security team, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to discuss a coordinated strategy to end the war. Kellogg criticized former President Joe Biden&apos;s approach of supporting Ukraine &quot;as long as it takes,&quot; calling it &quot;a bumper sticker, not a strategy.&quot; Kellogg emphasized that Trump&apos;s administration is focused on a &quot;holistic approach&quot; to ending the war, combining support for Ukraine with increased pressure on Russia. Trump&apos;s special envoy is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. Trump previously said on Feb. 5 that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia were progressing, though he did not provide specifics. Kellogg confirmed on Feb. 6 that Washington would not present a specific plan to end the war at the upcoming Munich Security Conference but reiterated Trump&apos;s goal of reaching a &quot;near-term resolution&quot; within 100 days of his inauguration. The Trump administration is weighing whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent settlement. Kellogg has suggested using frozen Russian assets to fund American arms supplies to Ukraine, an idea he first floated on Jan. 24. Zelensky said on Jan. 26 that diplomacy could be key to ending the war, suggesting that the Trump administration might accelerate the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-ready-to-double-russia-sanctions-to-end-war-in-ukraine-kellogg-says/	2025-02-07T02:40:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
Ukraine to host Trump's envoy Kellogg in February, top official says	Ukraine is preparing to host U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Feb. 7. According to sources in Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office cited by RBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after the Munich Security Conference. &quot;It is very important for President Volodymyr Zelensky and our team that the new U.S. administration receives full, realistic information about the situation on the battlefield as soon as possible,&quot; Yermak said. Yermak emphasized that Kyiv wants Washington to be fully informed about Ukraine&apos;s mobilization efforts, as well as the supply of weapons and equipment. &quot;Communication is important for developing a common position with partners because it is impossible to formulate any plans to achieve peace without Ukraine,&quot; he added. Yermak has already spoken with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and further contacts with other Trump administration officials are expected. He reiterated that Ukraine must approach negotiations from a position of strength and secure guarantees to prevent another Russian invasion. Ukrainian officials are finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Trump&apos;s return to office, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a Feb. 4 press briefing in Kyiv. Kellogg was initially expected to visit before Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, but the trip was postponed for legal reasons, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said in January. Talking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed that Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war that entails &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering positive initiatives for both. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/to-receive-full-realistic-information-ukraine-to-host-trumps-envoy-kellogg-in-february-yermak-says/	2025-02-07T01:28:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Czechia extends protection for Ukrainians, tightens rules for Russian applicants	Czech President Petr Pavel signed a law on Feb. 6 to extend the protection period for Ukrainian refugees, the Czech news site &#x10C;esk&#xE9; Noviny reported. The law also criminalizes unauthorized activities in favor of a foreign state and tightens requirements for Russian applicants seeking citizenship. Under the new provisions, temporary protection for Ukrainian refugees, set to expire in March, will be extended for another year in line with an EU-wide decision. This status allows refugees fleeing Russian aggression to access public healthcare, education, and employment opportunities in Czechia. The amended law also introduces a pathway for long-term residence permits for Ukrainian refugees who have lived in Czechia for over two years. Eligibility is conditional on financial independence, stable housing, and, for children, enrollment in a Czech school. The law also imposes criminal liability for unauthorized activities conducted in favor of a foreign state, with penalties ranging from up to five years in peacetime to a maximum of 15 years during martial law. New restrictions require Russian nationals seeking Czech citizenship to renounce their Russian citizenship and provide official proof of doing so. Exceptions will apply in specific cases, such as for asylum seekers. The legislative changes come as Czechia plays a key role in supporting Ukraine militarily. Prague unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners in early 2024 amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. A similar procurement plan for 2025 is also in development, according to Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-extends-refugee-status-for-ukrainians-tightens-rules-for-russian-applicants/	2025-02-07T00:07:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252537011.jpg

Trump imposes sanctions on International Criminal Court through executive order	U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Feb. 6. The sanctions could involve freezing assets and banning ICC officials and their families from entering the U.S. Trump&#x2019;s order claimed that the ICC&#x2019;s &#x201C;illegitimate actions set a dangerous precedent&#x201D; and that this endangers U.S. citizens and military personnel. The order also said that the ICC has overstepped its jurisdiction and &#x201C;abused its power&#x201D; in targeting U.S. and allied officials. Ukraine became the 125th state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Jan. 1. In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced deportations of at least tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-occupied territories. The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council who formerly served as defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for war crimes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court-through-executive-order/	2025-02-06T22:00:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
Slovakia resumes gas imports from Russia via TurkStream pipeline	Slovak gas company SPP began importing Russian gas again through the TurkStream pipeline on Feb. 1, with plans to double supplies by April, Slovak news agency TASR reported on Feb. 6. SPP Chairman Vojtech Ferencz confirmed that the company still has a contract with Gazprom, citing the lower transit fees compared to other suppliers. The pipeline goes through Turkey and Hungary, eventually reaching Slovakia. However, Michal Lalik, head of SPP&#x2019;s trade division, noted that Slovakia would still need additional imports from other routes, as the current imports cannot fully meet demand. Slovakia&#x2019;s gas needs in January were mainly met using domestic reserves, which remain above average. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Following Ukraine&#x2019;s decision, Fico threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-resumes-gas-imports-from-russia-via-turkstream-pipeline/	2025-02-06T19:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Trump administration suspends task force targeting assets of Russian oligarchs	The U.S. Justice Department is shutting down a program that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs, launched in 2022, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Feb. 5. In Bondi&#x2019;s memo, she stated that the program known as &#x201C;Task Force KleptoCapture&#x201D; will be discontinued, as the priority of the Trump administration is combatting drug cartels and international gangs. Initiated under former U.S. President Joe Biden, the program aimed to financially pressure wealthy allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and penalize those involved in sanctions evasion. While ongoing cases against Russian oligarchs will continue, the task force will no longer be centrally managed at the Justice Department. The changes will take effect for at least 90 days, with the possibility of becoming permanent. The task force previously seized assets from individuals such as Tsargrad TV channel owner Konstantin Malofeyev and Dagestani senator and billionaire Suleyman Kerimov. A civil forfeiture complaint against Malofeyev was first filed in the U.S. on Nov. 30, 2022, and prosecutors threatened to seize $5.4 million. Similarly, in April 2022 the U.S. seized Kerimov&apos;s $300 million superyacht and sanctioned his family and associates later that year.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-suspends-task-force-targeting-assets-of-russian-oligarchs/	2025-02-06T18:49:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Healthy' democracies can hold elections in wartime, Kellogg says	Ukraine will &quot;reach a point&quot; where it must hold elections in order to maintain the health of its democracy, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on Feb. 6. Kellogg previously said on Feb. 1 that Ukraine should aim to hold presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of the year. &quot;You&apos;re gonna reach a point where they&apos;re gonna have to have elections, and that&apos;s a sign of a healthy democracy,&quot; Kellogg said during an interview with Newsmax TV on Feb. 6. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean (President Volodymyr) Zelensky should leave,&quot; he clarified. Kellogg acknowledged that elections cannot take place immediately, as Ukraine&apos;s constitution prevents elections during martial law. Still, he asserted that the ability to hold a vote amid war indicated a well-functioning democracy. &quot;A sign of a healthy democracy is the willingness and the ability to have an election even in a time of war,&quot; he said. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on Feb. 4 that Ukraine will not hold elections until after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends. &quot;We will be very happy if elections are held in Ukraine because it will mean that we have won this war,&quot; she said. Under martial law, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned in Ukraine. If martial law had not been imposed, a presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Ukraine does not currently have the appropriate infrastructure or mechanisms to organize elections that guarantee all citizens&apos; electoral and political rights, according to the Ukrainian Civil Network Opora. The damage to Ukraine&apos;s electoral infrastructure stems in part from Russia&apos;s continued attacks. Zelensky said on Jan. 2 that parliament can set a date for elections as soon as the hot stage of Russia&apos;s war ends and martial law is lifted. Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014;&#xA0;an autocratic leader who has held power in Russia for over 20 years &#x2014;&#xA0;has sought to use Ukraine&apos;s delayed elections as a pretense to undermine Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy. The Kremlin-driven narrative has been repeated by far-right commentators in the U.S. Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s plans to end the war, is expected to visit Ukraine later in February for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/healthy-democracies-can-hold-elections-in-wartime-kellogg-says/	2025-02-06T16:30:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Trump to lay off nearly all USAID staff worldwide, NYT reports	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to eliminate the majority of the positions at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the New York Times (NYT) reported on Feb. 6, citing three people with knowledge of the plans. The cuts will reduce the agency from 10,000 staff worldwide to just 290, sources said. The announcement comes after the Trump administration issued a directive on Feb. 4 saying that all USAID employees will be placed on administrative leave starting Feb. 7. The administration informed USAID officials on Feb. 6 that it was canceling around 800 awards and contracts administered via the agency, the NYT sources said. The three people were granted anonymity as they are not authorized to publicly discuss the cuts. The 290 remaining employees include those specializing in health and humanitarian assistance, the sources said. Trump&apos;s attacks on USAID began from his first day in office. A Jan. 20 executive order imposed a 90-day freeze on all U.S. foreign assistance, including vital humanitarian aid projects in Ukraine. The agency has since been subsumed by the U.S. State Department, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio taking over as acting administrative director. Lawmakers from the Democratic party protested the move, calling it &quot;illegal.&quot; Rubio assured reporters on Feb. 4 that the U.S. was &quot;not going to eliminate foreign aid.&quot; Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. Since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. The funding has supported rebuilding schools, financing bomb shelters, and equipping hospitals with advanced medical equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-lay-off-nearly-all-usaid-staff-worldwide-nyt-reports/	2025-02-06T15:17:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Russian singer who spoke out against war in Ukraine dies after allegedly falling from window during police raid	Russian singer-songwriter Vadim Stroykin died on Feb. 6 while security officials were raiding his apartment, the Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info reported. Stroykin reportedly fell out of a window while officers were visiting his home as part of a criminal investigation into the singer&apos;s alleged donation to Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this report. Russian media claimed that Stroykin withdrew to another room while officers were raiding his St. Petersburg apartment. He then fell out of a 10th-floor window and reportedly died at the scene. At least one Russian outlet has referred to his death as a &quot;suicide.&quot; Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has reportedly launched an investigation into Stroykin&apos;s death. Stroykin previously spoke out against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the social media website VKontakte in 2022. His posts condemned the war and criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since the 2022 invasion, a number of prominent Russian figures have mysteriously died after falling from windows. Acclaimed Russian ballet dancer Vladimir Shklyarov, who also denounced the war in Ukraine, died in November 2024 after allegedly falling from his fifth-floor apartment. Shklyarov&apos;s death was reported as an &quot;accident.&quot; Russia has also detained and imposed harsh prison sentences against citizens for publicly criticizing the war or donating small sums of money to Ukrainian charities &#x2014;&#xA0;acts that are now considered treason under the Russian criminal code.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-singer-who-spoke-out-against-war-in-ukraine-dies-after-allegedly-falling-from-window-during-police-raid/	2025-02-06T14:14:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/stroykin-1.jpeg
More Russian soldiers died near Pokrovsk in January than in entire Second Chechen War, military says	Russia lost more soldiers in the Pokrovsk sector in Ukraine during the month of January than its total losses in the Second Chechen War, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said during a television broadcast on Feb. 6. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. Trehubov reiterated these numbers in his report, comparing the casualties to Russia&apos;s 10-year military campaign against Chechnya. &quot;The Second Chechen War for the Russians for the entire period &#x2014; 6,000 dead,&quot; he said. &quot;That is, under Pokrovsk alone in January the Russians have more dead than in the entire Second Chechen War.&quot; Russia launched the Second Chechen War in August 1999, marking its second and ultimately successful attempt to suppress Chechen rebels in the North Caucasus republic. International human rights groups condemned the Russian military for purposely targeting civilians and committing war crimes throughout the decade-long conflict. The total losses incurred by Russian forces in the Second Chechen War are difficult to verify, though official government figures claim the number is around 6,000. Moscow is now seeing staggering losses in its ongoing assault against eastern Ukraine, with some reports indicating that over 1,000 soldiers are killed or wounded per day. Russian forces continue to sacrifice high numbers of personnel for limited territorial gains &#x2014;&#xA0;a grim tactic that can push back significantly outnumbered Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 845,310 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction. Trehubov said that Russia launched 24 assaults against Pokrovsk over the past day, but that Ukraine continues to hold the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-russian-soldiers-died-near-pokrovsk-in-january-than-in-entire-second-chechen-war-military-says/	2025-02-06T13:11:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2174987136-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: First French Mirage fighter jets arrive in Ukraine	Key developments on Feb. 6: The first French Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets pledged to Kyiv have arrived in Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Feb. 6. &quot;On June 6, 2024, (French President) Emmanuel Macron announced the delivery of French Mirage 2000 to Ukraine. The first of these arrived in Ukraine today,&quot; Lecornu said in a post on social media. &quot;With Ukrainian pilots trained for several months in France on board, they will now participate in defending Ukraine&apos;s sky,&quot; he added. Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. In a further boost on Feb.6, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced the first Dutch F-16 fighter jets had also arrived. &quot;These modern combat vehicles are already in Ukraine and will soon begin performing combat missions, strengthening our defense and ability to effectively resist Russian aggression,&quot; he said in a post on social media. Ukraine&apos;s armed forces have reportedly launched a new offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian media claimed on Feb. 6. According to Russian military bloggers, Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked southeast of Sudzha, advancing toward the settlements of Fanaseevka and Ulanok. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukraine deployed up to two mechanized battalions for the offensive. As a result of alleged fighting, a gas pipeline was damaged in the Rylskyi district, Kursk Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the reported offensive. The possible operation follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks on Feb. 5 that Ukraine&apos;s presence in Kursk Oblast could play an &quot;important part&quot; in future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war. Ukraine struck the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai with drones overnight on Feb. 6, the General Staff reported. &quot;Confirmed hit and explosions in the target area. A fire has broken out. The results of the hit are being clarified,&quot; the statement reads. The airfield, located 230 kilometers (142 miles) from the front line, is a key launch site for Russian Shahed-type drones used against Ukraine, the General Staff said, adding it also serves as a storage, training, and maintenance facility for aircraft operating in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts. Russian local Telegram channels reported explosions near the airfield following the strike. &quot;Strikes on the facilities involved in ensuring Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine and terrorizing the civilian population will continue,&quot; the General Staff added. Washington will not present a plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said on Feb. 6. Speaking to Newsmax TV, Kellogg denied media reports that he would introduce such a plan at the conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Kellogg said the plan would be presented by U.S. President Donald Trump but did not specify a timeline. &quot;We are going to lead it up to him to help him out, get it to a point where he delivers that, but that is not going to happen next week at all,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;We are going to have great discussions with senior leaders in the European environment and bring back what we found out to the President of the United States and then go from there.&quot; Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the full-scale invasion, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. &quot;We are aware of the enemy&apos;s plans, which envisage 210,000 unmanned systems troops in 277 military units by 2030,&quot; Syrskyi said. The statement follows Syrskyi&apos;s monthly meeting on drone warfare, where he reviewed Ukraine&apos;s use of unmanned systems in January 2025. Syrskyi claimed improving coordination between drone units and conventional military forces from reports from brigades and battalions. According to Syrsyi, 66% of Russian equipment destroyed in January resulted from various types of attack drones. The number of targets hit by drones increased by 7% compared to December, with Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones responsible for 49% of all damage inflicted.

Trump has no official plan to end Russia's war against Ukraine, Zelensky says	U.S. President Donald Trump does not have an official plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;There is no official plan yet. What is in certain publications... I am sure that this is not President Trump&apos;s official plan,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump&apos;s designated envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has set a goal of resolving the war within 100 days. Reports suggested that the U.S. plan would be unveiled at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14-16, but Kellogg denied this, stating that Trump would introduce the plan first. He did not provide a timeline. Zelensky indicated that he has an understanding of the plan&#x2019;s direction, having discussed some details with U.S. officials before Trump&apos;s inauguration. &quot;Our teams will work together, there can be no plan separately from anyone, even from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Let&apos;s wait for our official negotiations and official results,&quot; he added. Kellogg said Trump would seek a resolution acceptable to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In early February, Trump claimed that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. He also threatened sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports if a peace deal was not reached soon. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&apos;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. However, as Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-has-no-official-plan-to-end-russias-war-yet-zelensky/	2025-02-06T11:50:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195875052.jpg
Kyivstar secures approval to acquire Uklon in multimillion-dollar deal	The Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMCU) approved Kyivstar&#x2019;s acquisition of taxi service Uklon on Feb. 6, Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov announced at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Ukraine. AMCU head Pavlo Kyrylenko said Kyivstar will also acquire Tech Uklon LLC, Uklon Corporate, and Uklon Ukraine. &quot;The committee concluded that Kyivstar&#x2019;s actions will not lead to structural changes in any of the three affected markets: online advertising, passenger transportation, and goods delivery,&quot; Kyrylenko said. Forbes Ukraine reported on Jan. 27 that Kyivstar had filed an application with Ukraine&#x2019;s antitrust regulator to purchase Uklon, estimating the deal&apos;s value at $40&#x2013;80 million. Uklon generated Hr 1.2 billion ($28 million) in revenue during the first three quarters of 2023, doubling its earnings from the same period the previous year. However, the company has struggled to expand internationally, facing tough competition from Uber and Bolt. Veon, Kyivstar&#x2019;s parent company, brings capital, expertise, and access to other markets, one market insider told Forbes. In January, Veon announced plans to list Kyivstar on Nasdaq, with Komarov suggesting this could happen in the third quarter of 2025. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyivstar has invested Hr 32 billion ($772 million) into the company. At the end of 2024, Kyivstar also signed an agreement to make Ukraine one of the first countries with access to Starlink&apos;s direct-to-cell service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-leading-phone-operator-kyivstar-allowed-to-buy-uklon/	2025-02-06T10:02:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1842489660.jpg
Kyiv Independent raises over $66,200 to support Ukrainian newsrooms hit by US aid freeze	The Kyiv Independent has raised over $66,200 to support three Ukrainian newsrooms affected by the U.S. freeze on foreign aid. A GoFundMe campaign launched on Jan. 30 quickly surpassed its initial goal of 40,000 pounds ($50,000) within days. Now closed, the campaign&#x2019;s funds are being distributed to the impacted media outlets. &quot;I&apos;ve never had any doubts that our audience shares our values, but the generous support of our readers was even beyond my expectations! I want to thank everyone who joined our effort to help our colleagues in the front-line regions &#x2014; donated or shared our fundraiser with their communities,&quot; said Kyiv Independent CEO Daryna Shevchenko. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days to review their alignment with his administration&#x2019;s policies. The freeze has affected numerous humanitarian and media organizations in Ukraine, including local newsrooms providing critical coverage in war-affected areas. The funds raised will be equally distributed among three front-line newsrooms: &quot;The raised funds will help us to survive this transition period and continue our work &#x2014; from daily news to investigative journalism and the implementation of concrete changes in the city,&quot; Dmytro Tishchenko, CEO of Tsukr, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This support from our colleagues will help us to keep our team and all areas of work while we build a sustainable model of existence through the community, business, and European partners.&quot; These three newsrooms operate in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most dangerous regions. Thanks to the campaign&#x2019;s donors, they can continue paying their journalists and providing crucial reporting. The Kyiv Independent clarified that its own operations were not affected by the U.S. aid freeze, as it no longer receives U.S. taxpayer-funded grants. While it previously benefited from such support in 2022 and 2023, the outlet now sustains itself primarily through small monthly donations from its community.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-raises-over-66-200-to-support-ukrainian-newsrooms-hit-by-us-aid-freeze/	2025-02-06T09:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1239705530.jpg
French trade chief says Paris involved in rare earths research in Ukraine, adds US not a competitor	French point man for foreign trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, came to Kyiv during a turbulent time. As U.S. aid to Ukraine was drying up, President Donald Trump had made public his desire to get a hold of Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth minerals in return for a new influx of American support. The idea of trading Ukrainian raw resources in exchange for aid was seen as a favorable scenario by Kyiv, desperate to keep the flow of military hardware into the country. Yet, the unilateral claim by Trump didn&#x2019;t sit well with European counterparts, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling Trump&#x2019;s statement &quot;very egoistic, very self-centered.&quot; While in Kyiv on Feb. 5, Saint-Martin selected grants for reconstruction projects in the fields of health, infrastructure, energy, demining and agriculture that would benefit from the &#x20AC;200 million grant fund and spoke with the Kyiv Independent about rebuilding Ukraine, extraction of rare earth minerals in the country, and a potential trade war between Kyiv&#x2019;s closest allies. Kyiv Independent: Mr. Saint-Martin, can you please summarize your visit? Laurent Saint-Martin: My role as foreign trade minister has a dual purpose. The first is to reaffirm France&#x2019;s support for Ukraine in a complex global context &#x2014; military, diplomatic, but also economic and commercial support. The second goal is to show that France and Europe continue to support Ukraine in mutual economic projects, benefiting both France and the European Union, and Ukraine by developing joint investment projects. Kyiv Independent: You mention a dual interest, particularly in a context where Donald Trump conditions American aid on commercial profits he could benefit from here, in Ukraine. How can we ensure Ukraine benefits from this as well? Laurent Saint-Martin: Ukraine is in a process of accession to the European Union. This process echoes the discussions we had at the Warsaw industry and trade meeting on Feb. 4, regarding the integration of Ukrainian companies in Europe and investments in Ukraine, whether foreign or Ukrainian. The aim is to integrate these investments into European value chains, offering competitive advantages. This requires investments in sectors like infrastructure, digital technology, and energy decarbonization. France has the expertise and solutions to address these needs. Kyiv Independent: In which areas can France offer something more than other Ukraine allies, including the United States? Laurent Saint-Martin: In areas like low-carbon energy production, France and Europe have a considerable advantage over other countries. The question is whether our companies, both large and small, have the capacity to provide solutions suited to Ukraine&#x2019;s specific challenges and to integrate these solutions into European chains. This requires appropriate financial instruments to enable these investments. Minister delegate for Foreign Trade Laurent Saint-Martin signs agreements with Ukrainian counterparts on Feb. 5, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Emmanuelle Chaze/The Kyiv Independent)We&apos;ve mentioned the 200 million euro aid fund and concessional loans in the infrastructure sector. These are tools that will help support the implementation of these projects. Kyiv Independent: Regarding French companies, can you provide specific examples of those that have established themselves in Ukraine? Laurent Saint-Martin: We have a network of French companies that have been present in Ukraine for a long time, many of which have remained active. France is the largest foreign employer in Ukraine, with around 25,000 employees. This is a significant asset, particularly in sectors like financial services, which are very important for local employment. There are also projects like the one by Xavier Niel, with a &#x20AC;1 billion investment in the telecommunications sector. We also support companies in the energy, water, and infrastructure sectors. Kyiv Independent: The issue of exploiting rare materials in Ukraine is currently being discussed, following Donald Trump&#x2019;s statements. What is France&#x2019;s position on this? Laurent Saint-Martin: France has been working with Ukraine on rare mineral exploitation for a long time, with French experts from organizations like BRGM and the inter-ministerial Direction for Rare Mineral Supply. These actors are already involved in projects. Of course, many of these resources are in occupied areas, but there are also many resources in the territories controlled by Ukraine. France remains fully involved in this sector, and we continue discussions with Ukrainian authorities. Kyiv Independent: And in that particular field, what is the added value of France? Laurent Saint-Martin: I believe that from technical expertise to exploitation, France has a complete supply chain when it comes to critical minerals. I was recently in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, with Orano nuclear company, for example, for a record investment in uranium that we made with the Mongolian authorities. The France brand in the critical minerals supply chain is now well-established and internationally recognized. Between Orano, Eramet mining company, and other smaller players, we possess solid know-how, strengthened by the expertise we provide, particularly in situations like the one we are discussing. Kyiv Independent: Regarding cooperation with the United States, how does France plan to approach these issues in Ukraine, particularly in the face of potential market competition? Laurent Saint-Martin: France&apos;s position is to prioritize complementarity over competition. We must work together &#x2014; first on military aspects, then on reconstruction and major economic issues like decarbonization and rare mineral exploitation. France, with its companies and expertise, undeniably adds value in these sectors. This is not about competition, but collaboration for the future of Ukraine and Europe. Kyiv Independent: France is also involved in Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction, have you observed any progress in Ukraine thanks to the involvement of French companies? Laurent Saint-Martin: France has significantly strengthened its financing capacity since the war began. This has provided a real boost to many projects. We now have financial tools like concessional loans and budget loans, which are essential for supporting reconstruction. The initial French fund of 200 million euros has received requests for projects worth over 750 million euros, which shows the enormous potential of French companies ready to get involved here. Regarding reconstruction, what I&#x2019;ve observed in discussions with French companies is that there has been real progress. Since my first involvement in this area, particularly with Business France, government agency, I&#x2019;ve been able to follow the situation&#x2019;s evolution. By the end of 2022, we saw that France had truly moved to the next level, especially in terms of financing capacity, which is a key point, and the number of companies now positioning themselves on certain projects has greatly increased. We now have actors who can mobilize the right financial tools, such as the French Development Agency or Expertise France. Kyiv Independent: To what extent does that also involve Ukrainian companies? Laurent Saint-Martin: We have been working closely with Ukrainian companies in various sectors. We are not just supporting reconstruction; we are investing in new economic directions, such as decarbonization and rare mineral exploitation, which open up new opportunities for Ukraine and Europe. There really is a virtuous circle here: the more we collectively invest in Ukraine, the more Ukraine will bring into the European production chain and strengthen Europe, while adhering to its calendar of joining the European Union. Kyiv Independent: Finally, how does France and the European Union position themselves with regards to Ukraine&#x2019;s decision not to renew its gas contract with Russia? Laurent Saint-Martin: This is a question that deserves particular attention, Ukraine doesn&apos;t need gas for its own consumption. The real issue is more about transit. There are ongoing discussions in Brussels about how to address this. One thing is clear: Ukraine does not want a contractual relationship with Russia, and this is understandable. There may be other solutions or suppliers, and alternative gas routes could be explored. But these discussions are currently moving forward, and they&apos;ve progressed enough. For instance, you may have seen that the Hungarians were very concerned about this, though they were somewhat less worried last week, especially after European sanctions against Russia were extended, which was obviously very important. So, we are making progress in the right direction, and indeed, the resilience of Ukraine&apos;s energy sector in this context is quite impressive.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-trade-chief-says-paris-involved-in-rare-earths-research-in-ukraine-adds-us-not-a-competitor/	2025-02-06T09:09:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192525672.jpg
Kyiv open to talks with South Korea on captured North Korean soldiers, ambassador says	Kyiv is open to negotiating with South Korea over the possible transfer of captured North Korean soldiers, Ukrainian Ambassador to Seoul Dmytro Ponomarenko said in an interview with The Korea Times published on Feb. 5. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in January, marking what President Volodymyr Zelensky called &#x201C;irrefutable evidence&#x201D; of Pyongyang&#x2019;s involvement in Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. It remains unclear whether Ukraine has captured additional North Korean soldiers. Zelensky said on Feb. 6 that the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) were injured in combat and are currently receiving medical treatment. While Ukraine and South Korea have yet to begin formal talks, Kyiv is ready to discuss the possible transfer of the soldiers to third countries, Ponomarenko said. &quot;Given the threat to the life and freedom of North Korean servicemen in the event of their repatriation to the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and if they refuse to go back, we are open for a dialogue with international partners,&quot; the ambassador said. If the captured soldiers choose to return home, Ukraine will be required to repatriate them under the Geneva Conventions. Ponomarenko called the possibility of negotiations between Kyiv and Pyongyang over the captured North Korean soldiers &#x201C;a very delicate issue&#x201D; and declined to comment further. As of early February, about 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s spy chief Kyrylo Budanov said. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched six months ago, on Aug. 6 on 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed in mid-January.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-discuss-north-korean-pows-transfer-with-seoul-ambassador-says/	2025-02-06T08:59:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192716379.jpg
US won't present plan to end Russia's war at Munich Security Conference, Kellogg says	Washington will not present a plan to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said on Feb. 6.

Speaking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war, which would involve &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering incentives to both sides. Trump&apos;s special envoy is also expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-present-ukraine-russia-plan-at-munich-conference-trumps-special-envoy-says/	2025-02-06T08:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1228655949.jpg
2 Russian oligarchs sell Alfa-Bank stakes hoping to escape EU sanctions, FT reports	Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven have sold their stakes in Russia&apos;s largest private bank, Alfa-Bank, and its insurance division in an effort to overturn European Union sanctions, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 6. Aven and Fridman were sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28, 2022, for their ties to the Kremlin and support for Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. In April 2024, the EU&#x2019;s General Court lifted sanctions against the two oligarchs, ruling that the EU had failed to demonstrate their role in undermining Ukraine. However, subsequent EU decisions kept them on the sanctions list under a different justification, classifying them as &quot;leading businesspersons providing substantial revenue&quot; to Russia. Investigative reporters revealed in May 2023 that Alfa Insurance, a subsidiary of Alfa-Bank owned by Fridman and Aven, provided insurance for vehicles used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The company has also reportedly serviced the Main Office of Special Programs, which is responsible for guarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to documents obtained by FT, Fridman and Aven sold their stakes in Alfa-Bank and its insurance division, Alfa Strakhovanie, for approximately 240 billion rubles ($2.5 billion) to longtime business partner Andrei Kosogov, who is not under EU sanctions. The oligarchs, who together owned 45% of Alfa-Bank and 42% of the insurance division, hope that cutting ties to the bank will strengthen their legal challenge against the EU&#x2019;s sanctions, the report said. Kosogov arranged to buy Fridman and Aven&apos;s Alfa-Bank shares using a loan from state-owned Gazprombank through a Cyprus-based holding company, according to correspondence seen by FT. However, due to transaction issues in Cyprus, Russia passed a law allowing the state to change the registration of &quot;economically significant&quot; companies operating under Western jurisdictions. Following this decision, Fridman and Aven no longer needed EU authorization to transfer control of their Russian assets, FT reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-russian-oligarchs-sell-alfa-bank-stakes-hoping-to-escape-eu-sanctions-ft-reports/	2025-02-06T07:36:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-654191414.jpg
UK to host Ramstein-format meeting next week, replacing US	London will host the next Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) summit in Brussels on Feb. 12, rather than the U.S., the U.K. Joint Delegation to NATO confirmed on Feb. 6. This will be the first Ramstein summit held under the U.K. since Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration took office. The meeting will be chaired by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &#x201C;The UDCG will gather ahead of the NATO Defense Ministerial Meeting to discuss priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against Putin&#x2019;s illegal invasion,&#x201D; the statement read. The future of the Ramstein&apos;s meetings remains uncertain, as Trump has signaled his intent to shift U.S. policy on Ukraine. Some of Ramstein&#x2019;s functions&#x2014;aside from organizing the meetings&#x2014;have already been transferred to NATO. The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) mission has been launched in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate weapons deliveries pledged by participating countries. The UDCG, which includes more than 50 countries&#x2014;including all 32 NATO members&#x2014;typically meets at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Its last gathering on Jan. 9 marked the 25th meeting since the group was established in April 2022. At the previous Ramstein meeting, discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses, including the delivery of new air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/london-to-chair-ramstein-meeting-next-week-instead-of-us/	2025-02-06T06:54:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
Russia's space chief Borisov dismissed amid program failures	Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Yury Borisov as CEO of the state space corporation Roscosmos, the Kremlin&apos;s official website announced on Feb. 6. Borisov&apos;s removal allegedly stems from uncertainty over the costs and implementation of the National Space Center project in Moscow, according to Russian media outlet RBC. Borisov was appointed as Roscosmos chief in July 2022, succeeding Dmitry Rogozin. His tenure saw a decline in launches, with 19 in 2023 &#x2014; three fewer than in 2022. Launches fell by 25% from pre-war 2021 and nearly halved compared to the early 2000s. Before leading Roscosmos, Borisov played a key role in Russia&apos;s military-industrial sector, overseeing the state rearmament program since 2011. As deputy chairman of the Military Industrial Commission, then-deputy defense minister, and later deputy prime minister, he was responsible for funneling 2 trillion rubles ($20.5 billion) annually into the defense industry. Under his leadership, Russia had pledged to produce divisions of new Armata tanks, a next-generation strategic bomber, 600 aircraft, and thousands of helicopters by 2020, while increasing the share of modern weapons in the military to 70%. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 exposed shortcomings in Russia&apos;s defense industry, with its forces relying heavily on aging Soviet-era equipment. Borisov also admitted that Roscosmos had failed to meet its 2023 state launch plan, adding to concerns over Russia&apos;s declining space capabilities amid economic strain and Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-space-chief-borisov-dismissed-amid-corruption-program-failures/	2025-02-06T05:31:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2184158229.jpg
Ukraine launches new offensive in Kursk Oblast, Russian media claims, Kyiv yet to confirm	Ukraine&apos;s armed forces have reportedly launched a new offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian media claimed on Feb. 6. According to Russian military bloggers, Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked southeast of Sudzha, advancing toward the settlements of Fanaseevka and Ulanok. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukraine deployed up to two mechanized battalions for the offensive. As a result of alleged fighting, a gas pipeline was damaged in the Rylskyi district, Kursk Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the reported offensive. The possible operation follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks on Feb. 5 that Ukraine&apos;s presence in Kursk Oblast could play an &quot;important part&quot; in future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war. Map showing Ukrainian-controlled territory in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, with taken areas marked in blue and the city of Sudzha indicated with a white marker. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Since August 2024, Ukrainian forces have maintained positions in Kursk Oblast following a cross-border incursion that initially captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Kyiv has lost roughly half of that area since then, combat operations continue. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian losses have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Ukraine aims to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks while continuing to target Russian military positions in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launches-new-offensive-in-kursk-oblast-russia-claims-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-02-06T04:59:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2194086327.jpg
Ukraine regaining nuclear weapons 'not going to happen,' Trump's envoy Kellogg says	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, dismissed the possibility of Ukraine regaining nuclear power status in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 6. &quot;The chance of them getting their nuclear weapons back is somewhere between slim and none,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest about it, we both know that&apos;s not going to happen.&quot; His remarks follow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent comments suggesting that if Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession remains blocked, the U.S. should provide an alternative security guarantee, including nuclear weapons. &quot;The president said we&apos;re a government of common sense,&quot; Kellogg added. &quot;When someone suggests that, consider the outcome or potential &#x2014; use your common sense.&quot; Zelensky acknowledged that gaining NATO membership could take &quot;years or decades&quot; and raised concerns about how Ukraine would defend itself in the meantime. Ukraine formally applied to join NATO at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an invitation, with countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia resisting its entry. As Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war , Russia has made a complete ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession one of its core demands. Ukraine relinquished its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, joining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia. Moscow later violated the agreement by occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014 and launching a full-scale invasion in 2022. While the war has renewed discussions on whether Ukraine should rebuild its nuclear deterrent, Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains its best security guarantee and has no plans to develop nuclear weapons. Kellogg will attend the Munich Security Conference from Feb. 14 to 16, where he will meet with world leaders to discuss Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and assess positions on negotiations. &quot;As you develop the plans to end this carnage, you have to make sure that you&apos;ve got the feel of everybody in play,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;Once we get to have these face-to-face discussions, then you can really kind of work &#x2026; on concessions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/not-going-to-happen-trumps-peace-envoy-rules-out-kyiv-regaining-nuclear-status/	2025-02-06T04:51:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Russia to recruit 210,000 personnel for drone forces by 2030, Syrskyi says	Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the full-scale invasion, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. &quot;We are aware of the enemy&apos;s plans, which envisage 210,000 unmanned systems troops in 277 military units by 2030,&quot; Syrskyi said. The statement follows Syrskyi&apos;s monthly meeting on drone warfare, where he reviewed Ukraine&apos;s use of unmanned systems in January 2025. Syrskyi claimed improving coordination between drone units and conventional military forces from reports from brigades and battalions. According to Syrsyi, 66% of Russian equipment destroyed in January resulted from various types of attack drones. The number of targets hit by drones increased by 7% compared to December, with Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones responsible for 49% of all damage inflicted. Ukraine has continuously expanded its drone capabilities, using aerial, naval, and ground-based systems for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and other operations. The country&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces announced on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian troops are now employing a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) while carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. On Feb. 6, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree officially establishing Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces as a separate branch within the Armed Forces, underscoring the growing role of drones in modern military strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-recruit-210-000-personnel-for-unmanned-systems-forces-by-2030-syrskyi-reports/	2025-02-06T03:18:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Ze.jpeg
First French Mirage fighter jets reportedly arrive in Ukraine — here's what they can do	The first French Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets pledged to Kyiv have arrived in Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Feb. 6. &quot;On June 6, 2024, (French President) Emmanuel Macron announced the delivery of French Mirage 2000 to Ukraine. The first of these arrived in Ukraine today,&quot; Lecornu said in a post on social media. &quot;With Ukrainian pilots trained for several months in France on board, they will now participate in defending Ukraine&apos;s sky,&quot; he added. Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. According to earlier repots, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multirole supersonic jet, was introduced by the French manufacturer Dassault in the 1970s. With over 600 aircraft produced across all variants, it serves nine countries, available in single- and twin-seat variants. The Mirage 2000-5, introduced in 1999, represents an upgraded version featuring advanced avionics, enhanced firing capabilities for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, and a modern sensor and control system. &#x201C;The (Mirage 2000)-5 variant has a high-quality radar, (is) fitted with drop tanks, has a reasonable range, and carries a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons,&#x201D; Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent last year. A significant enhancement of the Mirage 2000-5 is the inclusion of the Thomson-CSF Radar Doppler Multi-target (RDY), augmenting its capabilities for deep-strike and close-support missions. Equipped with a variety of air-to-air missiles and weapons, such as Mica missiles with a range of up to 60 kilometers or older Magic short-range missiles, the Mirage 2000-5 can be configured to meet diverse mission requirements. Its capacity for carrying drop tanks further extends its operational range. In terms of air-to-ground operations, the Mirage 2000 can deploy various weaponry, including SCALP missiles, previously supplied to Ukraine by France, and guided bombs. While the French Air Force has around 40 Mirage 2000-5s, only 26 one-seaters are in active service. The French military is reportedly planning to phase them out by the end of the decade, replacing them with the more advanced Dassault Rafale and thereby potentially freeing up the older Mirage 2000 aircraft for transfer to Ukraine. A Taiwanese Air Force Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet taxis on the runway, during the Sky Dragon aerial drill, at an airbase in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on 7 November, 2024 (Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Images)How can Ukraine use them?Mirage jets are versatile and can be used for ground strikes, intercepting missiles, and countering drones. Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent last year that Ukraine could use the aircraft to target Russian positions with Storm Shadow or SCALP missiles. According to Layton, the Ukrainian Air Force has a dwindling supply of Su-24 aircraft previously used for SCALP launches. Mirage 2000-5s can deploy anti-ship Exocet missiles and AS 37 anti-radar projectiles, Kevliuk added. The jets can also conduct strikes using long-range bombs, such as the AASM Hammer, and incorporate advanced precision-guided munitions like JDAM-ER and SDB, which offer increasing targeting accuracy and flexibility. However, Layton advised caution regarding Mirage ground attack missions near the front lines due to vulnerability to Russian air defenses. &#x201C;The Mirage 2000-5 has only a limited range when carrying bombs,&#x201D; even if fitted with drop tanks, Layton said. &#x201C;I think the small fleet of Mirage 2000-5s that will be provided would be too important to lose. This means air defense and firing long-range stand-off missiles is the best use for them.&#x201D; Air defense capabilities are crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense against ongoing Russian missile and drone attacks on civilian areas and critical infrastructure. Considering Macron&#x2019;s earlier statement permitting strikes on Russian military targets if they pose a threat to Ukraine, Mirage kets theoretically wouldn&#x2019;t be confined to Ukrainian airspace for their operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-french-mirage-fighter-jets-reportedly-arrive-in-ukraine-heres-what-they-can-do/	2025-02-06T02:47:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2182690921.jpg
North Korean missiles show improved accuracy in Russian attacks on Ukraine, Reuters reports	North Korean missiles used by Russia in attacks on Ukraine since December have become more accurate, Reuters reported on Feb. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Analysts believe North Korea is using the battlefield as a testing ground for its missile technology, enhancing its weapons for future use. North Korea has supplied Russia with artillery ammunition, ballistic missiles, and soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion. Military cooperation deepened after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defense pact with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. A military source told Reuters that more than 20 North Korean ballistic missiles fired at Ukraine have displayed improved accuracy in recent weeks, with their deviation from the intended target reduced to 50-100 meters. A Ukrainian official familiar with North Korean missile strikes also allegedly confirmed the information, according to Reuters. Reports indicate that North Korea has provided Russia with over 5 million artillery shells and at least 100 short-range ballistic missiles, including KN-23/24 types. Pyongyang has significantly advanced its missile programs in recent years, developing short- and medium-range systems that allegedly can carry nuclear warheads. Elsewhere, North Korean troops who had been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since last fall to support Moscow&apos;s war effort have reportedly withdrawn from frontline positions. Yonhap news agency, citing South Korean intelligence, reported on Feb. 4 that North Korean soldiers had not been engaged in combat since mid-January. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. Ukraine&apos;s forces have been operating in Kursk Oblast since launching a cross-border incursion in August 2024, seizing approximately 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-use-of-north-korean-missiles-in-ukraine-sees-greater-precision-reuters-reports/	2025-02-06T02:18:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
Russian media lies' — Ben Stiller denies claims about USAID funding his Ukraine trip, reposted by Musk	U.S. actor Ben Stiller has denied social media reports on Feb. 5 that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded his humanitarian trip to Ukraine, calling the claims &quot;lies coming from Russian media.&quot; &quot;I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind,&quot; Stiller posted on X, adding the claims were &quot;100 percent false.&quot; Stiller&apos;s comments came after billionaire Elon Musk reposted a fabricated story on X suggesting that USAID financed Western celebrities&apos; visits to Ukraine. In his role as a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) goodwill ambassador, Stiller met with Ukrainian families afflicted by Russia&#x2019;s war in a trip to the country in June 2022. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation also dismissed the claim, noting the alleged article in the post boosted by Musk did not exist on the news website it was purportedly from. &quot;Accordingly, the information it broadcasts is an invention of Russian fake newsmakers,&quot; the center said. Musk, head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) and owner of X, has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization&quot; and claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to shut it down. Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation warned that despite X being blocked in Russia, Kremlin propaganda continues to use the platform to spread false narratives. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. These are lies coming from Russian media. I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind. &#x1F4AF; percent false. https://t.co/EFBPmrFQJ6 The funding has supported rebuilding schools, financing bomb shelters, and equipping hospitals with advanced medical equipment. The agency&apos;s future remains uncertain as the Trump administration has frozen all international funding for 90 days. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that foreign aid should advance U.S. interests rather than serve as charity, stressing that the administration does not plan to end all international assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/self-funded-actor-stiller-denies-claims-of-usaid-funding-his-ukraine-trip-reposted-by-musk/	2025-02-06T02:05:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/13220d209a32c2e16c526150d0b5ef4f_1655744746.jpeg
Nearly 40,000 Russian troops lost in Kursk Oblast in six months, 16,000 killed, Ukraine says	Over six months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, with over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Ukrainian forces have also reportedly captured 909 Russian soldiers during the operation, bolstering Kyiv&apos;s exchange fund and enabling the return of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders held in Russian prisons. &quot;The Kursk offensive remains an example of sudden, asymmetric, and successful actions by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, allowing them to inflict heavy losses on a superior enemy and seize the initiative on the battlefield,&quot; the General Staff added. Ukraine has held positions in Kursk Oblast since launching a cross-border incursion in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Kyiv has since lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Ukraine aims to use its presence in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential negotiations. &quot;The operation forced the Russian occupiers to transfer significant resources to the Kursk Oblast, weakening their positions on other frontlines,&quot; the statement reads. The operation in Kursk Oblast may become an &quot;important part&quot; of future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 5. The General Staff also highlighted that &#xA0;Moscow was forced to seek military assistance from North Korea, which deployed around 12,000 troops to Kursk Oblast. Of those, an estimated 4,000 have been killed. One of the three North Korean brigades was &quot;effectively destroyed,&quot; while the other two lost combat capability, forcing Pyongyang&apos;s forces to withdraw from the front lines, the General Staff said. North Korean troops have not been engaged in combat in Kursk Oblast since mid-January, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 4. On the same day, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;We have to wait for some time to see if there are any real changes or if this is just lower activity for a couple of days,&quot; Budanov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-40-000-russian-troops-lost-in-kursk-oblast-over-six-months-military-says/	2025-02-06T00:51:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
1 killed, 24 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least one civilian and injured 24 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 6. Russia launched 77 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 56 drones over nine oblasts, while 18 others were lost without causing damage. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and wounded 18 others, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Donetsk Oblast, four civilians were wounded &#x2014; two in Pokrovsk, one in Lyman, and one in Roza &#x2014; according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kharkiv Oblast, two men were injured in Kupiansk &#x2014; a 57-year-old volunteer and a 43-year-old resident, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, shelling damaged at least 15 residential buildings, though no civilian casualties were reported. Ukraine has faced daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities continuing to report casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-24-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-05T23:45:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-05_20-00-06.jpg
Ukraine strikes Shahed-type drone launch site in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, military claims	Ukraine struck the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai with drones overnight on Feb. 6, the General Staff reported. &quot;Confirmed hit and explosions in the target area. A fire has broken out. The results of the hit are being clarified,&quot; the statement reads. The airfield, located 230 kilometers (142 miles) from the front line, is a key launch site for Russian Shahed-type drones used against Ukraine, the General Staff said, adding it also serves as a storage, training, and maintenance facility for aircraft operating in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts. Russian local Telegram channels reported explosions near the airfield following the strike. &quot;Strikes on the facilities involved in ensuring Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine and terrorizing the civilian population will continue,&quot; the General Staff added. Since the fall of 2022, Russia has launched thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed drones from Primorsko-Akhtarsk, targeting Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-airfield-in-krasnodar-targeting-shahed-drone-launch-site/	2025-02-05T23:00:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-06_07-21-55-2.jpg

Protest planned against 'Russians at War' documentary screenings in Australia	Members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Australia are set to protest the screening of the controversial &quot;Russians at War&quot; documentary at the Antenna Documentary Film Festival in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 6. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova&apos;s documentary Russians at War has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. The documentary has been criticized for lacking a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, failing to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime. Earlier in her career, Trofimova worked for Russia Today (RT), a Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organizations&apos; (AFUO) planned rally comes as controversy continues to follow the film, after initially appearing on the official list of screenings at the prestigious Venice and Toronto film festivals. Following protest across different cities since the film first raised controversy in September 2024, organizers at various international film festivals have pulled the film from various festivals&apos; schedule. Despite the anticipated protest, the Antenna Film Festival, which is scheduled to begin screening the film on Feb. 10, has not removed its scheduled screening from the festival&apos;s lineup. &quot;The Ukrainian community has come together with strength and focus to stop this russian propaganda being screened in Australia,&quot; the AFUO said in a statement. &quot;This film is not an independent expos&#xE9; &#x2014; it is a carefully controlled narrative that serves the interests of the Russian state.&quot; In the most prominent case, the Toronto International Film Festival decided to pull the film from the schedule, citing security concerns, but later decided to hold a special screening for the film after the end of the festival in September, drawing widespread criticism. Controversy further spread as it was revealed the Russians at War film received 340,000 Canadian dollars from the Canada Media Fund. On Oct. 7, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) began investigating Trofimova on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/protests-planned-against-russians-at-war-documentary-film-screening-in-australia/	2025-02-05T21:15:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/PXL_20240910_184239418.jpg
Azerbaijan to deliver $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine	Azerbaijan will deliver $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the form of electrical equipment to support the country&apos;s energy grid, President Ilham Aliyev&apos;s office announced on Feb. 5. &quot;Relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and Ukraine are developing on the basis of friendship and partnership,&quot; a statement from Aliyev&apos;s office read. Azerbaijan previously provided Ukraine with a batch of equipment for the restoration of the country&apos;s energy grid following the winter of 2023. Baku has also delivered at least 10 shipments of humanitarian aid for the energy sector since the start of the full-scale invasion, including at least 50 reserve power stations and 45 power transformers. The funding will come from the president&apos;s allocated reserve budget and will allow the country&apos;s Energy Ministry to disperse the aid directly to Kyiv. &quot;In connection with the current situation in Ukraine, the Azerbaijani state has repeatedly sent humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people,&quot; Aliyev&apos;s office said in a statement. In recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has attempted to form closer ties with Aliyev, offering Ukraine to serve as transit hub for Azerbaijani gas to Europe, following the suspension of Russian gas flows to the continent. Azerbaijan, who has maintained historical ties with Russia, has seen relations with Moscow dwindle in recent months following the Dec. 25 crash of Flight J2-8243, which killed 38 people. Aliyev has accused Russia of causing the crash, accusing the Kremlin of a &quot;disaster&quot; caused by the &quot;representatives of the Russian Federation.&quot; On Feb. 4, an unnamed Azerbaijani official told Reuters that the plane was struck by a Russian Pantsir air defense missile after diverting from Russian airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-to-deliver-1-million-in-humanitarian-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-05T19:36:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/aliyev.jpg
Georgian parliament votes to terminate mandates of 49 opposition MPs	Members of Georgia&apos;s ruling Georgian Dream party voted to revoke the mandates of 49 opposition parliamentarians on Feb. 5 after they refused to take their seats, citing concerns over the legitimacy of the results of the October parliamentary election. The vote effectively brings the total number of Georgian parliamentarians down to 89 of the 150 elected in the disputed parliamentary elections &#x2014; all of which now sit under the Georgian Dream party banner. &#xA0; Although 49 elected MPs formally requested to resign their mandates in protests, a further 12 opposition MPs from the &quot;For Georgia&quot; party have refused to attend parliamentary sessions. The October election, which was widely disputed by the opposition and international observers, re-elected the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has drawn criticism for steering Georgia closer to Russia while hindering its EU accession. Following the election, mass protests erupted in Tbilisi over the results, as well as amid a political crisis sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s announcement that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. Anti-Western politician Mikheil Kavelashvili, an ally of the ruling Georgian Dream party, was inaugurated as the country&apos;s sixth president on Dec. 29 in a move seen as illegitimate by the opposition. Georgia&apos;s fifth president, Salome Zourabichvili, said she would vacate the presidential palace but stressed she remains the only legitimate head of state, pledging to continue the struggle against the ruling party. Since the election, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions on Georgia over the perceived democratic backsliding. On Jan. 27, the European Union suspended parts of its visa facilitation agreement with Georgia.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-dream-votes-to-terminate-mandates-of-49-opposition-mps/	2025-02-05T18:17:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150233392.jpg
Baltic states to cut energy ties with Russia, join European power grid, AFP reports	Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia will disconnect from Russia&#x2019;s power grid this weekend and synchronize with the Western European network. Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia on Feb. 8, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius the next day. Lithuanian Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said the move ends Russia&#x2019;s ability to use energy as political leverage, according to AFP. The Baltic states have been preparing for this transition for years. Despite stopping Russian gas and electricity imports after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, their power grids remained linked to Russia and Belarus, with Moscow controlling electricity flows. At 7 a.m. local time on Feb. 8, the three countries will operate in &quot;isolated mode&quot; for 24 hours to test their ability to manage power levels. They will then integrate with Europe&#x2019;s grid through Poland. Lithuania&#x2019;s state-run grid operator, Litgrid, said the process includes switching power stations on and off to assess frequency stability. Lithuania has warned of potential risks, including cyberattacks and sabotage. Poland&#x2019;s power grid operator, PSE, will monitor the connection with helicopters and drones. Several undersea cables in the Baltic Sea have been damaged in recent months, raising security concerns. Russia has denied involvement. Officials say no major power disruptions are expected, but Estonian retailers report a rise in generator sales. The Baltic states are also increasing domestic energy production, including offshore wind farms.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-states-to-cut-energy-ties-with-russia-join-european-power-grid-afp-reports/	2025-02-05T16:16:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1527606933.jpg
Majority of Germans support military aid to Ukraine, survey shows	A majority of German citizens support providing military assistance to Ukraine, with a significant portion advocating for increased aid, according to a new poll by the Wahlen research group for ZDF Frontal, a German investigative political program. The representative survey found that 67% of Germans back Germany&#x2019;s military support for Ukraine. Within this group, 27% favor increasing military aid to Kyiv, while 40% believe Germany should maintain its current level of support. Meanwhile, 27% of respondents called for a reduction in weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Security expert Jana Puglierin from the European Council on Foreign Relations highlighted the significance of these findings. &quot;It is remarkable that, when combining those who want to continue supporting Ukraine, we reach 67%, which is a clear majority,&quot; she told ZDF Frontal. &quot;This means that the so-called &#x2018;Ukraine fatigue&#x2019; mentioned by some politicians is not reflected in the public.&quot; Support for military assistance is higher in western Germany than in the east. In the west, 70% of respondents support supplying weapons, with 28% calling for increased aid and 42% favoring the current level. In eastern Germany, 53% support military assistance, with 20% backing increased aid and 33% preferring the status quo. Among political party supporters, voters of the Green Party show the strongest approval for increasing arms deliveries to Ukraine, with 45% in favor. In contrast, 79% of Alternative for Germany (AfD) supporters and 52% of those backing the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance advocate for reducing military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/majority-of-germans-support-military-aid-to-ukraine-survey-shows/	2025-02-05T15:42:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-158520585-1.jpg
Ukraine imposes sanctions on Russian 'shadow fleet' captains, cultural heritage looters	President Volodymyr Zelensky has approved sanctions against 57 captains of Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers routinely used to evade sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s oil trade, and 55 individuals involved in looting Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural heritage in occupied Crimea. The measures, adopted by Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council on Feb. 5, target 56 Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other violations to bypass price caps. The individuals include captains of sanctioned tankers operated by Sovcomflot, a company already blacklisted by the U.S. and the U.K. By restricting experienced captains from participating in these operations, Ukraine aims to disrupt Russia&#x2019;s oil trade and raise operational costs for its shadow fleet. Additionally, sanctions have been imposed on Russian officials and cultural figures responsible for illegal excavations and the removal of Ukrainian artifacts from Crimea. Among those targeted are high-ranking officials from Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Culture, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and directors of major state-run museums, including the Hermitage and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts. They face asset freezes and international travel restrictions. Ukraine has also sanctioned three museums operating under Russian law on occupied territory, including the Tauric Chersonesos Historical and Archaeological Museum-Reserve, which houses UNESCO-listed heritage. Kyiv aims to draw international attention to Russia&#x2019;s unlawful cultural plunder and encourage partner nations to impose similar sanctions. These measures mark the first instance of individual accountability for shadow fleet captains aiding Russia&#x2019;s oil trade. Ukrainian authorities believe these sanctions will deter future participation in the tanker fleet and complicate Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to recruit new personnel while also curbing the looting of Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural treasures.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-shadow-fleet-captains-and-cultural-heritage-looters/	2025-02-05T13:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Euroclear to send 2-billion-euro tranche of Russian assets profits for Kyiv	The European Union will receive a second tranche of 2 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from profits generated by frozen Russian Central Bank assets that are meant for Ukraine and its war effort. Euroclear, the Belgian-based clearing house, sent its first payment of 1.55 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last July after the EU passed legislation that applied a windfall tax to the profits generated by Russia&apos;s assets immobilized in response to the full-scale invasion. The clearing house said in a statement on Feb. 5 that the second payment is expected to be made in March and should amount to approximately 2 billion euros. Euroclear earned 6.9 billion euros ($7.18 billion) in 2024 from frozen Russian assets, the statement says. In 2023, these revenues amounted to 4.4 billion euros ($4.6 million). From the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in 2024, 1.7 billion euros ($1.77 billion) was transferred to the Belgian budget as tax revenues. In reaction to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, more than $300 billion of the foreign exchange reserve assets of the central bank of the Russian Federation were frozen in Europe. Most of these funds &#x2014;191 billion euros ($198 million) &#x2014; are kept in the international depository Euroclear in Belgium. The Group of Seven countries agreed last year on a $50 billion loan that will be paid back using the profits generated from frozen assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-than-2-billion-of-russian-assets-profits-in-europe-are-to-be-transferred-to-the-fund-for-ukraine/	2025-02-05T13:00:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1904616761.jpg
DVL Group, owner of Ukraine’s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell, plans to cut 15% of IT staff following merger	Ukraine&apos;s newly formed telecommunications company DVL Group is planning to cut 15% of its IT department due to business consolidation and optimization, the company told Economichna Pravda on Feb. 4. &#xA0; French billionaire Xavier Niel bought and merged fixed operator Data Group Volia and Lifecell &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator &#x2014; last year in a deal worth more than $500 million. It was the largest foreign direct investments into Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation provided $435 million to finance the deal. DVL plans to restructure its IT department, unifying the business model of all three operators, which may lead to staff reductions, the company said. The process is set to be completed in 2025. &quot;The review, updates, and optimization affect company costs, business processes, IT systems, and organizational structures. For each area, we&apos;re choosing solutions that will allow continued operations without losing efficiency or service quality,&quot; DVL stated. As part of the transformation, the technical division will expand significantly. The company will hire more than 300 new specialists to implement energy resilience projects and build and modernize grids.	https://kyivindependent.com/dvl-group-owner-of-ukraines-third-largest-mobile-operator-lifecell-plans-to-cut-15-of-it-staff-following-merger/	2025-02-05T12:23:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1857415237.jpg
Ukraine's operation in Kursk Oblast may become 'important part' of negotiation process, Zelensky says	Ukrainian forces&apos; operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast may become an &quot;important part&quot; of the negotiation process to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 5 after a meeting with British Foreign Minister David Lammy in Kyiv, Ukrinform reported. Zelensky previously concurred that Kyiv would seek an end to the war this year but urged partners to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength. In a surprise turn, the Ukrainian president also recently acknowledged the possibility of sitting at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve peace. &quot;You will see what conditions the Russians will have for Ukraine regarding the Kursk direction when we reach a diplomatic settlement of the war&apos;s end. This was a crucial step,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I don&apos;t like to use words like &apos;historic.&apos; Ukraine&apos;s whole life, its struggle, is probably a historical path, and so I will not use this word in relation to this operation. But it was definitely very important,&quot; the president added. Zelensky mentioned that Feb. 6 will mark exactly six months since Ukraine launched its incursion in Kursk Oblast. The president added that Ukrainian forces &quot;are steadily keeping the situation (under control) there and will continue to do so&quot; when the Russian army suffers &quot;heavy losses.&quot; Zelensky also noted that several important targets had been hit by Ukraine with long-range weapons in Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think that they (Russian forces) will not be able to push us out of this territory shortly, and this is like a magnet that keeps 60,000 of their military in this area today,&quot; the president said. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. Trump&apos;s team may present a plan to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine during the Munich Security Conference next week, according to Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-operation-in-kursk-oblast-may-become-important-part-of-negotiation-process-zelensky-says/	2025-02-05T12:19:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Almost 3 times more people died in Ukraine than were born in 2024, data shows	Ukraine registered 495,090 deaths of various causes in 2024, which is almost three times more than were born, according to data published by the Justice Ministry. The data was collected only on territory currently controlled by Ukraine. Due to a lack of access, figures for the partially occupied Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are likely incomplete and the data is completely missing from occupied Luhansk Oblast and Crimea. The highest mortality rate of 53,268 deaths was recorded in the front-line Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. About 35,000 deaths were recorded in the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv Oblast, located in the northeast on the border with Russia. Justice Ministry data showed that 176,679 children were born in Ukraine in 2024. Compared to data before the full-scale invasion in 2021, births decreased by 97,093, or 35.5%. The city of Kyiv recorded the highest number of births, with 19,706, followed by Lviv Oblast in the west with 15,642, and the heavily populated central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with 14,029. The least amount of children were born in Kherson Oblast with 434 births recorded last year. Kherson Oblast is partially occupied by Russia, with the Ukrainian-controlled parts subject to regular Russian attacks. The country&apos;s population went from a peak of over 50 million in the early 1990s to over 37 million by January 2024. According to one of the U.N.&apos;s projections, Ukraine&apos;s population could drop to 15.3 million by 2100.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-3-times-more-people-died-in-ukraine-than-were-born-in-2024-data-shows/	2025-02-05T11:55:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241589667.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine returns 150 people from Russian captivity in prisoner swap	Key developments on Feb. 5: Ukraine brought back 150 Ukrainian service members from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 5, marking the latest prisoner exchange between Kyiv and Moscow. The released Ukrainian captives included members of the Navy, the Air Force, the Airborne Troops, the National Guard, the State Border Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces, and a police officer, according to the president. &quot;They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common: They fought for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. Some POWs had been held captive for more than two years, according to Zelensky. Among the released soldiers are those in serious condition. They have a long rehabilitation and recovery ahead, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported. At the same time, Russia announced the return of 150 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) from Ukrainian captivity. During the last exchange, which took place on Dec. 30, 2024, 189 people returned from Russian captivity. In 2024, 1,358 Ukrainians were released, and since the beginning of the all-out war, 3,956 Ukrainians have returned from Russian captivity, Zelensky said in his New Year&apos;s address. Ukrainian forces struck a Russian oil facility in Krasnodar Krai and a Buk air defense system in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight on Feb. 5, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. An attack carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Defense Forces set fire to the Albashneft oil facility in Novominskaya in southwestern Russia, according to the statement. Earlier the same day, Krasnodar Krai authorities reported a Ukrainian drone attack that started a fire at an unspecified oil depot that allegedly contained a &quot;residual amount&quot; of petroleum product. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;The hit has been confirmed,&quot; the General Staff said, describing the facility as a &quot;mini-refinery&quot; involved in the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel for Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of damage to the facility is being determined. The General Staff also reported a successful hit against the Buk system in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, adding that &quot;damage to the target was recorded.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The U.K. will provide Ukraine with 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new humanitarian and economic assistance to promote a long-term partnership between the two nations, the British government announced on Feb. 5. &quot;This funding for social, humanitarian, and energy programs will strengthen our resilience. And this assistance is very timely right now,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at a press conference with his British counterpart, David Lammy, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Lammy is visiting Kyiv to discuss continued U.K. support for Ukraine as it enters the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The U.K. official is expected to assess firsthand how British aid is assisting Ukraine on the battlefield and in civilian infrastructure recovery. The new funding is part of a broader 100-year partnership agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16. In addition to the financial aid, the U.K. will allocate 3 million pounds ($3.7 million) to supply Ukrainian grain and other food products to Syria, working with the World Food Program. &quot;Unlike Russian grain supplies to the brutal Assad regime, which attempted to buy favor while burdening Syria with costly debt, this planned support will provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in Syria,&quot; the British government&apos;s statement read. London previously committed a record 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024, including advanced weapons systems and munitions. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26 billion pound ($2.7 billion) loan under the G7 program will also be released to fund major procurement projects for Ukraine&apos;s defense. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets, marking another step in the West&apos;s efforts to use Russia&apos;s frozen funds to finance Ukraine&apos;s war effort and recovery. &quot;We have agreed on the need to continue using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In the near future, we will begin utilizing funds from the U.K. loan of more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) sourced from these assets,&quot; Sybiha said. The Defense Ministry is launching an initiative to increase the use of unmanned ground systems in the Ukrainian army, introducing robotics units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 5. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in unmanned vehicles, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, revolutionizing warfare. Ukraine is increasing the production of unmanned ground systems and deploying full-fledged robotic units as part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; combat brigades on the front line, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote on Facebook. &quot;We continue transforming the Ukrainian Armed Forces into a modern army with a technological advantage over the enemy. Our goal is to create an army in which innovative technologies help to perform the most dangerous tasks while saving the lives of our defenders,&quot; Umerov said. The project is the result of tests conducted in cooperation with the military since the summer of 2024, he added. Unmanned ground systems have proven to perform several tasks on the battlefield, including offensive and defensive activities, evacuation of the wounded, logistical support for units, and mining and demining areas, according to the minister. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. The U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons, if it is not ready to accept the country into NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published on Feb. 4. &quot;What kind of support package, what kind of missiles? Will they give us nuclear weapons? Then let them give us nuclear weapons,&quot; the president said when talking about possible guarantees instead of quick NATO entry. Zelensky acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession could be delayed &quot;for years or decades,&quot; raising the question of how the country would defend itself. Ukraine applied to join NATO at the outset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge last year that Kyiv&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia continue to resist its entry. Zelensky argued that while the West can supply Ukraine with missiles to deter Russia, their ability to stop Russian nuclear weapons is &quot;a rhetorical question.&quot; &quot;Let&apos;s do this: give us nuclear weapons back; give us missile systems; help us finance a million-strong army; or deploy your contingents in parts of our country where we want stability so that people feel safe,&quot; Zelensky said, outlining hypothetical alternatives. The comments come after Zelensky criticized Ukraine&apos;s 1990s decision to give up its nuclear weapons without receiving robust security guarantees in return. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arsenal stationed on its territory and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In exchange, the U.S., U.K., and Russia provided security assurances. Twenty years later, Russia occupied Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years on, it is waging a full-scale war against Ukraine. The invasion has reignited discussions over whether Ukraine should develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent, though Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains the best possible security guarantee and said it has no plans for building a new nuclear arsenal. Ukraine has lost 45,100 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. Zelensky added that there have been a total of 390,000 cases of soldiers sustaining wounds on the battle, although the actual number of wounded soldiers is less given that some soldiers sustained multiple wounds during separate incidents. In previous statements on the total casualty count, Zelensky said that approximately half of the soldiers wounded in action later return to the battlefield. The comments from Zelensky comes as a rare admission from a Ukrainian official about the casualty count on the front line. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count in December 2024, claiming that Ukraine had lost 43,000 solider, with &quot;370,000 cases of medical assistance for the wounded.&quot; Despite the estimates, Zelensky added that it was not clear as to how many thousands of men are currently held as prisoners of war compared to those missing in action. &quot;How many of those are missing (in action) and how many of those are prisoners (of war), I do not know the precise number but we are working on it,&quot; Zelensky added. Comparing Ukraine&apos;s casualty count to that of Russia, Zelensky said in the interview that approximately 350,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, with between 600,000 to 700,000 instances of Russian soldiers sustaining wounds on the battlefield.
