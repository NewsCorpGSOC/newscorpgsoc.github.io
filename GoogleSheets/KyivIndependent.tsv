Ukrainian partisans sabotage railway line linking Moscow to Kursk Oblast, group claims	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a key railway line linking Russia&apos;s Moscow and Kursk oblasts, disrupting Russian supply lines, the group claimed via Telegram on Dec. 6. An operative burned down a relay cabinet near the village of Chekhov in Moscow Oblast, Atesh said, posting undated video footage of the alleged sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the group&apos;s claims. The operation aimed to disrupt Russian military logistics, Atesh reported. The targeted railway connected Moscow to Kursk Oblast, which has been partially occupied by Ukrainian forces since August. &quot;Deliveries of fuel and military equipment intended to supply Russian troops on the front line were delayed,&quot; the group said. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, seeking leverage against Moscow in future prisoner exchanges and peace negotiations. Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops, including North Korean soldiers, in an effort to take back the border region. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The group reported a similar action against a railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-sabotage-railway-line-linking-moscow-to-kursk-oblast-group-claims/	2024-12-05T21:32:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/atesh.jpg
Ukrainian group in US opposes Starlink expansion due to Musk's Russia ties	The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA), a U.S. nonprofit, has taken action to block the tech company SpaceX from placing nearly 22,500 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit, CNBC reported on Dec. 5. The group cited concerns over SpaceX CEO Elon Musk&apos;s &quot;contacts with Russia and the alleged use of his Starlink system by Russian forces in Ukraine.&quot; Musk, a billionaire and close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has made controversial statements about the war in Ukraine and has allegedly held secret calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials. The UCCA, which represents Ukrainian-Americans, filed a petition to deny and motion for stay with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Dec. 4, urging the agency to conduct further review before allowing SpaceX to launch 22,488 additional Starlink satellites. &quot;There is a necessity to determine if Starlink has been used to help a foreign adversary,&quot; UCCA President Michael Sawkiw, Jr., told CNBC. &quot;If yes, this is not in the national security interest of Ukrainian-Americans, or of the entire country.&quot; In its petition to the FCC, the UCCA also referenced environmental considerations and conflict-of-interest issues arising from Musk&apos;s involvement in the incoming Trump administration. SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial communications advantage on the battlefield. While SpaceX does not sell units to Russia directly, Russian troops in Ukraine continue to obtain Starlink terminals through shadowy supply chains and intermediaries. The Russian military&apos;s illegal use of Starlink terminals has contributed to territorial losses in Ukraine, including the fall of Vuhledar, the Washington Post reported in October. Musk has denied selling any Starlink units to Russia and said that Starlink would not connect to any devices there. Democratic senators recently called for an investigation into Musk&apos;s involvement in SpaceX programs due to reports that he held secret conversations with Putin and other Russian officials. SpaceX currently holds billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts with the Pentagon and NASA, and has a $1.8-billion intelligence community contract to develop a spy satellite network. The Pentagon financially supports Starlink access for the Ukrainian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-group-in-us-opposes-starlink-expansion-due-to-musks-russia-ties/	2024-12-05T20:43:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188387321.jpg
Putin changes Russian gas payment laws after US sanctions Gazprombank	Russian President Vladimir Putin has changed laws on how foreign buyers can pay for Russian gas following recent U.S. sanctions. Previously, Russian law required foreign buyers to pay for gas products via Gazprombank exclusively, per a decree Putin issued in March 2022. The U.S. on Nov. 21 imposed new sanctions targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank. Washington had avoided sanctioning Gazprombank in the past in order to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies. Gas buyers will now be unable to purchase Russian energy products through Gazprombank accounts until the sanctions are lifted. According to Putin&apos;s new law, gas purchases are no longer tied to Gazprombank. Gas payments can also be settled by offsetting mutual debts, as an alternative to cash payments. Following the U.S. sanctions, Hungary, a Kremlin-friendly state, requested a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports via Gazprombank. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the new restrictions a &quot;threat to energy security.&quot; The latest U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. According to the Financial Times, Russia has used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-lets-foreigners-buy-russian-gas-on-payments-for-russian-gas-after-us-sanctions-on-gazprombank/	2024-12-05T19:42:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1253747748.jpg
White House planning new weapons, sanctions package in last-minute effort to aid Ukraine, Sullivan says	The White House is planning a last-minute effort to aid Ukraine, including more weapons and sweeping sanctions against Russia, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Dec. 5, according to a briefing shared with the Guardian. Sullivan reportedly committed to providing the aid to Ukraine during a meeting on Dec. 5 with Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office. Washington will send Kyiv hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles by mid-January, the briefing said. The U.S. also offered to train soldiers at sites beyond Ukrainian territory. The support will be accompanied by $20 billion in loans backed by frozen Russian assets, agreed to earlier this year as part of the G7 pledge, and another round of sanctions against Moscow. The purpose of the latest package is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position ahead of peace talks with Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to shore up assistance to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized military support for Kyiv, takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has signalled that he wants Kyiv to enter into negotiations with Moscow as soon as possible. The reported aid commitment comes a day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson rejected Biden&apos;s request for an additional $24 billion in aid to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m not planning to do that,&quot; Johnson, a Republican and Trump backer, said during a press briefing Dec. 4. Yermak led a Ukrainian delegation on a visit to Washington Dec. 4-5 to meet with members of Trump&apos;s incoming administration, including Vice President-elect JD Vance. He reported that he met with Sullivan on Dec. 5, but has not yet shared details of the discussion. National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Andriy Yermak for more than an hour on Thursday, committing to provide Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of rockets and hundreds of armored vehicles by mid-January, according to the briefing shared with the Guardian. The US is also pledging to support Ukraine&#x2019;s manpower challenge, offering to train new troops at sites outside Ukrainian territory. This comes alongside a nearly finalized $20bn in loans, which will be backed by profits from immobilized Russian sovereign assets. The United States is tying that to a number of new sanctions to come in the coming weeks, all with the intent of complicating Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain its war effort and boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s bargaining power at the negotiation table that could lay the groundwork for a future settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-planning-new-weapons-sanctions-package-in-last-minute-effort-to-aid-ukraine-sullivan-says/	2024-12-05T18:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154173632.jpg
Russia using more glide bombs as artillery advantage slips, Western officials say	Russia&apos;s artillery advantage against Ukraine is diminishing, dropping to 1.5 rounds for each Ukrainian shell, Sky News reported on Dec. 5, citing unnamed Western officials. Previously, Russian shells outnumbered Ukrainian ammunition by a minimum ratio of five to one. The current decline is due to a &quot;wide variety of factors,&quot; Western officials told Sky News on the condition of anonymity. These include production and transport difficulties, along with Ukrainian drone strikes against ammunition depots. Shipments of Western ammunition supplies have also helped Ukraine level out the disparity. Russia is still finding other ways to maintain fighting power, officials said, pointing to Russia&apos;s increased use of glide bombs. There has been a &quot;massive increase in Russian glide bomb use on the front line to devastating effect,&quot; one official said. Ammunition shortages have plagued Ukraine over the course of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The EU failed to deliver on its promise to produce 1 million artillery shells between March 2023 and 2024 while political disputes in Washington led to a severe delay in a $61 billion aid package. &quot;Russia vastly outnumbers us in daily artillery attacks,&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at an artillery coalition session on Jan. 18. &quot;At different areas of the front and stages of hostilities, they fired five to 10 times more artillery shells than the Ukrainian forces.&quot; Before Ukraine acquired Western-provided NATO-standard 105- and 155-millimeter artillery systems and munitions, the disparity between rounds fired daily by Ukrainian and Russian units in some cases reached a ratio of 50 to 1,500, according to sources in Ukraine&apos;s military. Ukraine has now received more than a third of the 500,000 155 mm shells expected to be delivered under the Czech ammunition initiative by the end of 2024. Even as Ukraine narrows the ammunition gap, Russian forces continue to gain ground in Ukraine&apos;s east, seizing territory at heavy personnel costs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-losing-artillery-advantage-in-its-war-against-ukraine/	2024-12-05T17:48:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166298605.jpg
EU announces 25 million euros in funding for Ukrainian NGOs, civil society	EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova announced 25 million euros ($26.5 million) in funding on Dec. 5 for Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations that will advance work related to Ukraine&apos;s eventual EU integration. The funding, announced at the Civil Society Development Forum in Kyiv, will provide 15 million euros ($15.9 million) for small NGOs across Ukraine over the next three years, with a further 10 million euros ($10.6 million) going towards civil society work on EU integration. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s civil society is not only a pillar of democracy but also a source of unbelievable strength and resilience in the face of Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression,&quot; Mathernova said in a statement. &quot;I am proud that, with EU funding, smaller local organizations will continue their critical work for Ukraine&#x2019;s victory and our shared European future.&quot; Amid Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has stepped up support for Ukraine in response to Ukraine&apos;s EU aspirations. In a statement, the EU said it has increased annual funding for civil society organizations in Ukraine from $21.2 million to $63.5 million. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, marking a pivotal step in its integration efforts. Previously, Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine said 2030 is a very real date for Ukraine to join the European Union, in an interview on May 9.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-funding-for-ukrainian-ngos-civil-society/	2024-12-05T16:17:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/DSC02737.jpg
Trial begins in Finland for Russian neo-Nazi fighter accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine	A Finnish court began trial on Dec. 5 for Yan Petrovsky, a Russian neo-Nazi mercenary, for war crimes he allegedly committed while leading a Russian neo-Nazi unit in eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2015. Petrovsky is co-leader of Rusich, a Russian neo-Nazi paramilitary unit that has fought against Ukraine. He is accused by Ukraine, and now Finland, of committing war crimes during the Russian invasion of Donbas that started in 2014. Finnish authorities arrested Petrovsky in July 2023 as he tried to fly to France under the name Voislav Torden, a false identity. Court documents seen by Reuters indicate Petrovsky faces five charges of committing war crimes in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for the alleged crimes. Petrovsky is accused of co-commanding a group of Rusich fighters who ambushed Ukrainian soldiers, after deceiving them. The Rusich fighters allegedly waved a Ukrainian flag at a roadblock in September 2014. They seriously wounded 4, and killed 22 in the incident. Prosecutors allege that the ambushed soldiers were executed and mutilated. The use of deception to carry out the ambush also constitutes a war crimes under the Rome Statute and the Geneva Conventions. Ukraine previously requested his extradition so that he could stand trial for the alleged war crimes, but a Finnish court ruled on Dec. 8, 2023, that he could not be forced to go to Ukraine because it said conditions in Ukrainian prisons do not meet standards set by the European Convention on Human Rights. The Rusich unit has previously pride itself on atrocities, publishing photos and videos of the torture and murder of Ukrainian citizens. The co-founder of Rusich Alexey Milchakov gained notoriety for publishing images of himself killing a puppy on social media. Petrovsky has been under EU and U.S. sanctions since 2022. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-neo-nazi-fighter-goes-on-trial-in-finland/	2024-12-05T14:26:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1249518587.jpg
Owners, top managers of popular online casino in Ukraine suspected of collaborating with Russia	The beneficial owners and top managers of one of the most popular online casinos in Ukraine, Pin-Up, are suspected of collaborating with Russia, the State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) and the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Dec. 5. The casino&apos;s owners, who are Russian citizens, allegedly collected personal data and information about the location of their users, including military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other military formations. The law enforcement agencies did not mention the name of the company in their statements. Olena Duma, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), said the suspects are the representatives of Pin-Up. Individuals associated with the casino operate in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast, contributing to the Russian state budget as well as financing the military-industrial complex and armed aggression against Ukraine, according to the DBR. One of the unnamed accused individuals, who &quot;controls the online casino&apos;s work,&quot; has been financing an organization that helped Russian veterans who fought in Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war. In May, the Pecherskyi Court in Kyiv seized the accounts of Pin-Up&apos;s online casino. It later approved the transfer of over Hr 2.6 billion ($62.5 million) of the company&apos;s seized assets to the ARMA. The state agency in turn used those funds to purchase military bonds. Pin-Up continues to operate in Russia and on Russian websites, the law enforcement agencies reported. Gambling was officially banned in Ukraine in 2009 until its legalization in 2020. The negative impacts of gambling, especially on the Ukrainian soldiers, became a topic of public discussion in the spring of 2024 as a petition demanding restrictions on online gambling reached the president&apos;s table in March. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on April 20 approving restrictions on online gambling and banning it for the military while martial law remains in effect.	https://kyivindependent.com/owners-top-managers-of-popular-online-casino-in-ukraine-suspected-of-collaborating-with-russia/	2024-12-05T12:54:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149356635.jpg
Belarusian soldiers fighting for Ukraine say time is running out for their brother-in-arms extradited to Belarus	In Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s Belarus, helping to defend Ukraine against Russia gets you labeled as a terrorist. Vasil Verameichyk, a Belarusian who enlisted in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces just four days after Russia launched its all-out war, was detained on Nov. 13 in Vietnam in a suspected covert operation by Belarusian secret services. He was extradited to Belarus the next day. Verameichyk had previously served in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, which is comprised of Belarusian volunteers who fight for Ukraine. For this, Belarusian state-controlled media described him as a &quot;wanted member of a terrorist organization.&quot; Vasil Verameichyk, a former fighter of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, was detained in Vietnam and extradited to Belarus in Minsk, Belarus, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Screenshot from ONT video)Minsk, though not directly participating in Russia&apos;s war, has aligned itself with Moscow. At the same time, it has escalated repression against pro-democracy Belarusians, both domestically and abroad, who stand in solidarity with Kyiv. Verameichyk is faced with at least 20 years in prison if convicted. His Belarusian brothers-in-arms, still serving in Ukraine, are hoping to rally Kyiv to do whatever they can to secure his release &#x2014; as they would for any Ukrainian soldier &#x2014; before his time runs out. &quot;Vasil could even be punished by death for his military service in Ukraine,&quot; Andrei Kushnerau, another Belarusian-born soldier who is currently serving in the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Something needs to be done to guarantee his safety &#x2014; and quickly.&quot; Verameichyk&apos;s time in combat was curtailed by injury in April 2022, but not before the 30-year-old played a role in several battles. During his military service in Ukraine, he fought to defend Irpin and Bucha in Kyiv Oblast, as well as Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk Oblast, against advancing Russian forces. Verameichyk also received a medal from Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence for helping orchestrate the evacuation of over 60 Ukrainian soldiers from encirclement near Oleksandrivka in Mykolaiv Oblast. &quot;Vasil has always been proactive and courageous, never shying away from danger,&quot; Kushnerau said, who served alongside Verameichyk. &quot;He is a promising soldier and opposition politician.&quot; After returning from a trip abroad to visit family, Verameichyk was reportedly banned from reentering Ukraine in September 2022. The ban, which extends until 2025, was allegedly the result of a personal conflict with a staff officer in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment. &quot;But Vasil constantly tried to (find a way to) return to the front line and join a different unit,&quot; Kushernau, who is also the founder of the Association of Belarusian Volunteers, said. He ultimately ended up traveling to Lithuania, a key refuge for many of the over 500,000 Belarusians who fled the country following the post-2020 crackdowns. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Lithuanian government has grown increasingly adverse toward the number of Belarusians in the country. In 2023, a draft law that saw newly-arrived Russians prohibited from obtaining Lithuanian citizenship, owning property, applying for visas, or extending their residence permit was nearly extended to include Belarusians, narrowly averted by public opposition. Additionally, Belarusians, like Russians, have also been asked to disclose their past affiliations and their views on topics such as the annexation of Crimea to &quot;prove&quot; they do not pose threats to Lithuanian national security. This policy turn has made the situation for Belarusian exiles in Lithuania increasingly difficult. The leading figures of the Belarusian exile, who have been based primarily out of Lithuania, have been forced to navigate a delicate political landscape as a result. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in her online call to action to save Verameichyk, did not mention that Lithuania made the possibility for him to remain in Europe impossible for the immediate future. Lithuania imposed a 30-month entry ban to the EU and Schengen Area on Verameichyk for &quot;national security threat&quot; in July 2023, citing Verameichyk&apos;s military service in Belarus during his youth as the reason. Kushnerau described the decision as a &quot;complete oversight of Verameichyk&apos;s service to defend Ukrainian sovereignty&quot; in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. A Belarusian volunteer soldier from the Kastus Kalinouski regiment, a regiment made up of Belarusian opposition volunteers formed to defend Ukraine, fires a 120mm mortar round at a front line position near Bakhmut in the Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on April 9, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry declined the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment on the matter, citing that Verameichyk&apos;s case was &quot;the jurisdiction of the migration department of the Interior Ministry,&quot; but acknowledged that it was following the case. &quot;Supporting Belarusian democratic forces and civil society remains one of the Lithuanian government&apos;s foreign policy priorities. Lithuania had been providing shelter for those fleeing repressions,&quot; the ministry said in its statement. &quot;This support shall be continued.&quot; The Lithuanian Interior Ministry did not reply to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment by the time of this article&apos;s publication. Yet, Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite told Lithuanian Media outlet LRT on Nov. 22 that the State Security Department had decided to label him a &quot;threat to national security.&quot; The Lithuanian State Security Department also did not reply to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment by the time of this article&apos;s publication. Belarusian citizens abroad face limited visa-free travel options, and their ability to secure long-term residency in a foreign country became even more challenging in September 2023 when Lukashenko&apos;s regime prohibited the renewal of passports at Belarusian embassies abroad. Unable to remain in Lithuania or travel to any of the countries in the Schengen Area, Verameichyk eventually made his way to Vietnam, where Belarusian security services were lying in wait. Belarusian soldiers fighting on the side of Ukraine are hoping Kyiv will facilitate Verameichyk&apos;s inclusion on the prisoner exchange list, according to Kushnerau, given Verameichyk&apos;s prior military service in Ukraine. They are also considering petitioning Kyiv to negotiate a swap with Minsk that would see Verameichyk exchanged for Yevhen Shevchenko, a Ukrainian politician ousted from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People Party in 2021 after meeting with Lukashenko. Shevchenko is believed to have established ties with the Belarusian regime. He was detained by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) in mid-November on suspicion of treason after negative public comments he made about the war. &quot;We don&apos;t have many other options (to get Verameichyk out of Belarus),&quot; Kushnerau said. The President&apos;s Office did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment on either potential exchange scenario. More than 1,300 Belarusians have fought for Ukraine, and at least 60 have been killed since 2014. Verameichyk is not the first Belarusian volunteer among them to face issues with Russia-linked authorities for his military service in Ukraine. Servicemen of the &quot;Volat&quot; battalion of the Belarusian Kastus-Kalynovskyi volunteer regiment plant flags at Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on Oct. 12, 2023. (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Yan Dziurbeika, who also served in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, faces charges from prosecutors in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast for being a &quot;mercenary&quot; fighting in Ukraine between February and July 2022. Dziurbeika, along with fellow Belarusian fighter Siarhei Dzyohtseu, was captured by Russian forces in July 2022. If convicted, Dziurbeika faces seven to 15 years in prison. Verameichyk&apos;s extradition to Belarus is part of what appears to be a growing trend of Moscow-allied countries being ready to extradite foreigners who fought for Ukraine, putting those fighting for the country at risk not only during their military service but also after it ends. Alexander Ante and Jose Aron Medina, two Colombian men who served in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, were detained by Venezuelan authorities at the end of August during a layover in Caracas at the request of Russia&apos;s Security Service, the FSB. Ante and Medina are currently being held in custody in Russia &#x2014; they face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. If Belarusian state-controlled media is any indication, the security services will only continue their targeting of Belarusian soldiers fighting alongside Ukrainians against Russia. The head of the security service&apos;s investigative department, Konstantin Bychyk, was featured in a recent propaganda film that included Verameichyk. After footage was shown of Verameichyk being taken away in cable ties on the tarmac of Minsk Airport, Bychyk declared that pro-Ukrainian Belarusian soldiers &quot;should live with the knowledge that Belarus will find them, no matter where they are in the world.&quot; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s struggle for a better future is ongoing, especially as the Lukashenko regime continues to target innocent individuals. We must also remember amid all this the many Belarusian soldiers risking their lives to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression&#x2014;they don&apos;t get enough coverage but deserve our recognition and support.

Not a single day did this document work' — Zelensky on 30th anniversary of Budapest Memorandum	The Budapest Memorandum, signed on Dec. 5, 1994, did not work for &quot;a single day,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on the 30th anniversary of the document&apos;s signing. &quot;Today marks 30 years of the Budapest Memorandum. Ten years of war. Not a single day did this document work,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And because of this, everyone in the world will now know that a mere signature &#x2014; by any state &#x2014; or any assurances or promises are not enough for security.&quot; According to the Budapest Memorandum, the signatory countries &#x2014; the U.K., Russia, and the U.S. &#x2014; pledged to be guarantors of Ukraine&apos;s independence, as well as sovereignty, and refrained from using weapons or economic pressure against Ukraine. In exchange, Ukraine renounced its nuclear status. Zelensky added that effective guarantees are needed for Ukraine&apos;s security, namely &quot;real alliances and a real security foundation within the country,&quot; as well as &quot;weapons that enable defense, and deterrence of the enemy.&quot; The president also called for unity, saying it helps to overcome &quot;even the most challenging moments.&quot; Anton Liagusha, the academic director of the master&apos;s program in Memory Studies and Public History at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine agreed to a non-nuclear status under enormous pressure. &quot;Russia used the Budapest Memorandum very cunningly. To be more precise, it encouraged and coerced the West to pressure Ukraine to sign the memorandum. At the same time, Russia positioned it as &apos;a noble act of global geopolitics,&apos;&quot; Liagusha said. &quot;Russia promoted the narrative that Ukraine is a failed state, a non-existent state, and non-existent means uncontrolled. And in a non-existent uncontrolled state, nuclear weapons are the worst possible option. Unfortunately, this cunning and sneaky diplomacy and propaganda reached their goals.&quot; According to the historian, giving up nuclear weapons was a mistake, and now Ukraine must try to restore its nuclear capabilities to be able to defend itself. Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 17 that the country is not planning to develop weapons of mass destruction and remains committed to nuclear non-proliferation.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-single-day-did-this-document-work-zelensky-on-30th-anniversary-of-budapest-memorandum/	2024-12-05T12:16:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian forces regain control of Novyi Komar village in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Dec. 5: Ukrainian troops have driven Russian units out of Novyi Komar village in Donetsk Oblast, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, told Suspilne media on Dec. 5. Novyi Komar, a village with a pre-war population of less than 500 people, is located about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of the Russian-occupied town of Vuhledar. &quot;The enemy was driven out of there,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;The village of Novyi Komar is under the control of the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces.&quot; A day before, crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that soldiers of the 48th Separate Assault Battalion regained control of the village. Russian forces suffered heavy losses, and some Russian soldiers fled to the highway near the village, according to DeepState. At the same time, Ukraine&apos;s counteroffensive actions are not as significant as Russia&apos;s ongoing assaults in the country&apos;s east. Russia captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in one week in mid-November, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Ukrainian officials have also increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms are not flowing in as fast as Kyiv has hoped. At least six Ukrainian mayors and community heads remain in Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 5 during an address to the human rights community. Zelensky confirmed that Yevhenii Matvieiev, the mayor of occupied Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, died in Russian captivity. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said that Matvieiev was tortured to death. Matvieiev was captured in March 2022 while trying to assist residents of his community. &quot;They are among thousands of Ukrainians who are innocent but have been in captivity for years. And not only since 2022, but also since 2014,&quot; Zelensky said. The president said that Ukraine is doing everything possible to secure the release of its citizens. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, both civilian and military, remained in Russian captivity as of November, according to Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Of them, over 19,500 are Ukrainian children. Only 3,767 of the abducted Ukrainian childern have been freed. Zelensky criticized the global response, noting the lack of significant action to stop Russia&apos;s crimes and punish those responsible. &quot;There are still few voices in the world that speak about Ukrainian children abducted by Russia,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that discussions about &quot;freezing&quot; the war often ignore the fate of millions of Ukrainians and hundreds of thousands of children in occupied territories. Zelensky expressed regret over the fading international focus on Russian war crimes. &quot;Even the most large-scale Russian war crimes are gradually being forgotten by many in the world and in Europe, at the political level, among those who could act to fix everything,&quot; he emphasized. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in captivity, according to Victoria Tsymbaliuk of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Ukrainian military will get over 30,000 DeepStrike attack drones in 2025 within President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s resilience plan, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Dec. 5. According to Umerov, DeepStrike drones are of the new generation, capable of &quot;operating autonomously over long distances and hitting targets with high accuracy.&quot; &quot;We are demonstrating to the world that Ukraine is capable of innovation and technological independence. Even in wartime, we are developing cutting-edge production and strengthening our defense capabilities,&quot; Umerov said. Zelensky presented a 10-point resilience plan to the Ukrainian parliament on Nov. 19, which includes measures to stabilize the front line, increase the technological capabilities of Ukrainian forces, and overcome bureaucracy in the army. The production of part of the DeepStrike drones that will be supplied to the Ukrainian army next year was financed by international partners who invested in the Ukrainian defense industry, according to Umerov. The minister did not say how these drones will be distributed among Ukrainian troops. Ukraine is working to scale up domestic defense production, aiming to produce 1.5 million drones by the end of 2024. There is a &quot;significant volume&quot; of new and long-term orders for first-person-view (FPV) drones, reconnaissance drones, long-range drones, and missile-drones, Zelensky said on Dec. 3. Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields and logistics, as well as oil refineries and depots. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, speaking at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) meeting in Malta on Dec. 5, strongly opposed any agreements resembling past Yalta or Minsk deals that could legitimize Russian aggression. The comments come as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to put a swift end to the war in Ukraine and bring both sides to the negotiating table. &quot;Russia wants a second Yalta or at least a third Minsk. It wants a world of zones of influence where power dictates the rules, changes borders, and deprives people of their right to freedom. But we are clear: there will be no Yalta-2 or Minsk-3,&quot; Sybiha said during a closed-door meeting. This referenced the 1945 Yalta conference on dividing post-World War II spheres of power in Europe between the Soviet Union and Western powers and the unsuccessful 2014-15 Minsk I and II agreements on ending the war in Donbas. The minister accused Russia of using &quot;peace plans&quot; as a pretext to continue its aggression. &quot;We have seen what Russian peace means in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium. For them, it means mass graves, ruins of cities, and killed Ukrainian civilians. Ukrainian children are abducted, their names are changed, and they are forcibly assimilated into Russian culture,&quot; he said. Sybiha added that Russia is not genuinely interested in negotiations, urging the international community to focus on Moscow&apos;s actions rather than its words. &quot;Russia continues to expand the war,&quot; he warned. The OSCE meeting in Malta was also attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, marking his first visit to the EU since the start of the full-scale war. Sybiha called Lavrov a war criminal and left the OSCE plenary hall in protest ahead of Lavrov&apos;s address. Several other foreign ministers and diplomats followed suit in a coordinated walkout.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-dec-5/	2024-12-05T11:50:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181306828.jpg
Ukrainian publishing house Osnovy wants to 'fill gap caused by 70 years of Soviet rule'	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Andriy Vyshnevsky believes the future of Ukraine lies in the pages of books. This year, he helped resurrect Ukraine&#x2019;s oldest independent publishing house, Osnovy, after purchasing the company with his wife Svitlana Matvienko, director of the Ukrainian School of Political Studies.Now, as the CEO and co-owner of Osnovy, he is leading the company&#x2019;s mission to educate Ukrainian citizens and popularize Ukrainian authors both at home and abroad. Ukraine is undergoing a literary renaissance as it faces Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with many looking to fill in the blanks left by decades of Soviet repression of Ukrainian culture. &#x201C;We have to recall our past and simplify access to the literature of earlier periods of Ukrainian history and return to our foundations. We need to understand how we can use that part of literature as a foundation for what we will build upon it,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent from Osnovy&#x2019;s office in Kyiv&#x2019;s historic center. Osnovy is as old as independent Ukraine. Founded in 1992 by Canadian citizen Bohdan Kravchenko and Ukrainian citizen Solomiya Pavlychko, it was the first publishing house in the country to translate world classics into Ukrainian and has since published over 400 titles. In its first phase, Osnovy focused on translating books on economics, philosophy, and politics, from Aristotle to Simone de Beauvoir&#x2014;&#x201C;the key texts on which the Western civilization is based,&#x201D; Vshnevsky explains. Osnovy itself translates to &quot;foundations.&quot; Osnovy&#x2019;s idea was to bridge the gap between Europe and the newly independent Ukrainian population that had suffered generations of restricted access to knowledge. The company opened new doors to the international market after Dana Pavlychko, Solomiya&#x2019;s daughter, took over in 2012 during its second phase. She shifted the focus to publishing English language photography and art books looking at niche subjects from orthodox churches to women working on Ukraine&#x2019;s railways. Osnovy team in their office in an undated photo. (Andriy Vyshnevsky / Osnovy)Looking towards the future, Vyshnevsky will prioritize the domestic market as Ukrainian society pulls through the traumas of war. Osnovy will go back to its foundational texts as well as new translations of modern literature, both fiction and non-fiction, to broaden its readers&#x2019; minds.&#x201C;The purpose of Osnovy is to provide Ukrainian society with intellectual resources to be better prepared for the challenges we are going to face after Ukraine wins this war,&#x201D; he said. Osnovy was on its last legs when Vyshnevsky took over in June. The majority of the company&#x2019;s dozen employees fled Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, including former-owner Dana Pavlychko, and efforts to keep it afloat from abroad were in vain. Revenues dropped from Hr 8 million ($192,000) in 2022 to Hr 4 million ($96,000) in 2023, leaving Pavlychko with little option but to sell. Over the last six months, Vyshnevsky managed to build up the employees from two to 13 and the new team inherited 15,000 unsold books that helped provide some cash flow to restart the company. Osnovy has a special place in Vyshnevsky&#x2019;s heart as Bohdan Kravchenko was one of the first people he met after moving to Kyiv from his hometown Kharkiv in the early 2000s. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine he would take over from Kravchenko 25 years later.This year, Vyshnevsky is hopeful Osnovy will once again turn a profit with 57 book projects currently underway and plans to publish 30-40 titles per year. The covers of Classical Ukrainian literature reimagined: (L-R) &quot;The Kaidash Family&quot; by Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky, &quot;The City&quot; by Valerian Pidmohylny, and &quot;Tiger Trappers&quot; by Ivan Bahrianyi. (Osnovy)His optimism is bolstered by the increasing number of Ukrainians turning to books as Russia pummels Ukrainian cultural institutions, including Osnovy&#x2019;s printing partner Faktor Druk in Kharkiv, which suffered a major missile strike in May.&#x201C;It might sound paradoxical, but I think that the full-scale war encouraged people to read,&#x201D; Vyshnevsky said. Osnovy first got going in 1992 with financial support from the International Renaissance Foundation, an NGO funded by philanthropist George Soros, although it was soon self-sufficient as the books flew off the shelves. Vyshnevsky admits that Osnovy is a niche publishing house, and that the challenge is fulfilling its mission of popularizing specialized literature while making money. But Osnovy has a growing customer base, which Vyshnevsky was surprised to discover is very young, with around 85% between 18 and 35 years old. He will also redirect Osnovy&#x2019;s strategy towards smaller, independent bookstores rather than big retailers. Ukrainians have recently flocked towards cozy, community-focussed bookshops and Vyshnevsky is partnering with several across Ukraine as he aims to expand beyond the 100 stores currently stocking Osnovy&#x2019;s publications. The 2014 Euromaidan Revolution was a big catalyst for change for Osnovy and propelled the company to its peak popularity, Vyshnevsky said. While that was partially driven by Ukrainians&#x2019; surging interest in their culture, it was also because the revolution attracted the eyes of foreigners to Ukraine. Under the direction of Dana Pavlychko, the company began publishing stylish photography and art books in English for the first time. The international market proved to be a hit, with over 300 stores in Europe and North America selling Osnovy&#x2019;s books as well as online stores like Amazon. &#x201C;Photo books were a good tool to popularize Ukraine and Ukrainian culture,&#x201D; Vyshnevsky said. &#x201C;We pay attention to the tactile characteristics. You should want to touch the book, hold it in your hands,&#x201D; he added, commenting on the aesthetic graphic design and high-quality printing and binding. One of Osnovy&#x2019;s most well-known publications, &#x201C;Decommunized: Soviet-Ukrainian Mosaics&#x201D; by photographer Yevgen Nikiforov, was popular both domestically and abroad and deals with the complexities of Ukraine&apos;s Soviet and independent identity. Through communist-era mosaics, Nikiforov shows the imperial legacy of the Soviet Union while also honoring the craftsmanship of Ukrainian artists, Vyshnevsky said. Ukrainian Railroad Ladies: A Visual Exploration of the Traffic Controllers Profession on Ukrainian Railway Crossings by Sasha Maslov. (Osnovy)Osnovy is preparing a new edition of the book which will take on a different perspective as some of the mosaics have been destroyed by the war, or are stuck in Russian-occupied territories. The new edition will be a chance to reflect on Ukraine&#x2019;s past, present, and future, in the context of the full-scale invasion, Vyshnevsky said. &#x201C;By printing these books in English and selling them abroad, we make our own reflection inclusive by encouraging and engaging people from the West into this process. We are trying to show that Ukrainians were deprived of the opportunity to communicate with the Western world, but we are a part of the Western world,&#x201D; he added. Before Vyshnevsky&#x2019;s takeover, Osnovy was primarily focused on the international market and rarely marketed books inside Ukraine. Vyshnevsky wants to go back to the company&#x2019;s roots and see&#x2019;s Osnovy as a public service for Ukraine to strengthen its weaknesses that could be exploited by Russia again.&#x201C;Our role is to prepare Ukrainian society for life after the war is finished,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We need critical thinking, good education, and the professional skills and ability not only to survive, but also to build sustainable institutions and to develop them.&#x201D;In the fallout of revolutions and the full-scale invasion, Ukrainians are unearthing their history, particularly the writers purged by the Soviet regime in the 1920s and 1930s known as the Executed Renaissance. Osnovy published a series of illustrated books from this generation in 2016, although the writers have only recently garnered more mainstream attention. Osnovy stickers around the city walls. (Osnovy / Facebook)&#x201C;This literature is not just an archive like for many other European nations. It is material we need to work on right now and to go back to the past to better understand our future,&#x201D; he said. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion has also pushed readers towards contemporary Ukrainian literature and authors writing about the war. Osnovy had never published modern-day Ukrainian writers, but Vyshnevsky is now considering it to meet the demand. He also believes it&apos;s important for foreigners to read Ukrainian authors. As Ukraine begins EU integration talks, the country should have translations in European languages of its novels that were &#x201C;eliminated&#x201D; from the European cultural context, Vyshnevsky stressed.&#x201C;It is important to fill the gap caused by 70 years of Soviet rule,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If we don&apos;t, this gap will remain and we will be trying to build over it, instead of building a solid foundation.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-publishing-house-osnovy-wants-to-help-build-ukraines-future/	2024-12-05T11:41:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/owen.jpg
On a forgotten part of the front line, Russian forces mass for assault on Dnipro islands	With attention focused on Moscow&apos;s grinding advances in Donbas, and Ukraine&apos;s efforts to hold onto Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, one area of the front lines continues to see daily battles but little coverage. Ukrainian and Russian forces are locked in an ongoing fight over a series of small islands in the Dnipro River, control of which would allow Moscow&apos;s forces to intensify attacks on the embattled city of Kherson in southern Ukraine. &quot;Local clashes take place (for the Dnipro islands) every day,&quot; Viktor Kevliuk, a retired military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The enemy is fighting for the islands with the 61st Marine Brigade of the Northern Fleet &#x2014; Ukrainian marines are countering them.&quot; Kevliuk adds that neither side is fully in control of the islands, though he says Ukraine &quot;has the advantage&quot; in an ongoing fight which sees both sides trading intense artillery fire and drone attacks.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;In the context of all combat clashes (along the front line), the southern direction is relatively the calmest, but only when compared to other situations along the battle line,&quot; he said. But on Dec. 4, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin told the Financial Times that Russia &quot;wants to launch another offensive&quot; in the direction of Kherson, and had assembled &quot;300 boats to cross the river,&quot; suggesting this relatively quiet part of the front line may be about to heat up. &quot;Controlling the Dnipro islands means controlling the Dnipro River and its coastline,&quot; Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the &quot;South&quot; unit of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army, a volunteer military formation, told Ukrainian Radio last month. In the fall of 2022, a Ukrainian counteroffensive succeeded in pushing Russian forces out of the city of Kherson, and other regional settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Since then, Russian and Ukrainian positions have been largely separated by the wide, swampy river dotted by numerous small islands. The map showing a battle for the Dnipro islands. (The Kyiv Independent)From their new positions on the east bank, Russian forces continued to shell Kherson and the surrounding villages, killing civilians in attacks which continue to this day. Ukraine wanted to push eastward from the river to create a buffer zone between the Russian-held east bank, and the Ukrainian-controlled west bank, making it harder for the Russian troops to launch attacks. In February 2023, Ukrainian troops began conducting risky raids across the river, probing Russian defenses. By the summer, the first reports emerged of Ukraine holding a bridgehead on the other side of the Dnipro River near the destroyed Antonivsky Bridge. The operation reached its zenith around October when Ukrainian troops entered Krynky, a small coastal village on the east bank, turning it into the key bridgehead for Kyiv&apos;s troops operating across the Dnipro River.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Krynky became the focal point of intense battles but the front line remained largely static for months despite heavy losses on both sides. In December 2023, the Kyiv Independent reported from Dnipro River&apos;s left bank, speaking to soldiers taking part in the cross-river raids. Many said the fighting felt &quot;hopeless.&quot; By July of this year, Ukraine was forced to withdraw from its Krynky bridgehead. Since then, Russian attacks on Kherson have only intensified, even incorporating the deliberate targeting of civilians with FPV drones in what has been dubbed a &quot;drone safari.&quot; &quot;Currently, we can see how Russian drones are terrorizing Kherson, targeting civilian cars,&quot; Bratchuk said. &quot;In order to further escalate these terrorist attacks, the Russians aim to capture the (Dnipro) islands and deploy additional forces there.&quot; Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, said on Nov. 28 that Russian forces are constantly trying to gain footholds on and around the Dnipro islands. &quot;(Russian troops) are doing this to seize bridgeheads on the west bank and draw some of our forces and resources there, just as we did in Krynky,&quot; he said. The day before, Voloshyn also said Russian troops were massing on the Tendra and Kinburn spits, in an effort to control the mouth of the Dnipro. Voloshyn said Ukrainian forces maintained fire control over positions in the area, and were continuing to fend off the Russian attacks, a view shared by experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(Russian forces) are trying to storm with small forces to constrain Ukraine&apos;s reserves, forcing Ukrainian troops to use artillery shells. In this way, Russia aims to weaken our defensive line,&quot; Dmytro Zhmailo, a military expert and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;However, since our artillery and FPV drones are actively operating in this region, the front line along the Dnipro is more secure. Therefore, these provocation operations will be costly for the Russians,&quot; he added. Zhmailo said another objective for Moscow&apos;s troops was to maintain pressure along as much of the front line as possible to stretch Ukrainian forces.

(Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&quot;Through these actions, Russia also seeks to prevent Ukrainian forces from reinforcing Kursk, Kurakhove, and other key areas where the enemy is advancing,&quot; he said. But Prokudin&apos;s comments on Dec. 4 suggest Russian forces are about to increase pressure in the area. Voloshyn, also speaking on Dec. 4, said Russia is now training assault groups in occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence data, adding Moscow&apos;s troops are practising how to cross water obstacles and transfer landing groups. Speaking to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), he reassured that there &quot;has not been a single successful attempt at this assault or enemy crossing in a month.&quot; &quot;The Ukrainian Defense Forces are now reliably defending the city of Kherson and Kherson Oblast, and the entire west bank,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/on-a-forgotten-part-of-the-front-line-russian-forces-try-to-secure-footholds-on-dnipro-islands/	2024-12-05T11:36:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149869914.jpg
Coffin prices in Russia have soared by 74% since start of full-scale invasion, media reports	The price of coffins in Russia has soared by 74% since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Times reported on Dec. 5, citing Russia&apos;s Federal State Statistics Service (RosStat). The news comes as Russian forces continue to advance in eastern Ukraine at a long-unseen pace over the past few months, albeit at the cost of record losses. Russia suffered record losses of personnel in November, reaching the number of 45,720 wounded, killed, or captured soldiers. Russia has lost a total of nearly 750,000 troops since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022, according the the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. &#xA0; In January 2022, a coffin in Russia cost about 4,437 rubles ($44), rising to 7,711 rubles ($76) in October 2024, according to the Moscow Times. The rapid rise in coffin prices began in the first months of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another rapid price increase occurred after mobilization was announced in Russia in September 2022. Coffins rose in price by 48% in 2022, almost 12% in 2023, and another 10% in the first nine months of 2024. In some regions, coffin prices increased by more than 100% in 2023, such as Sakhalin(181%), Omsk Oblast (162%), Tambov Oblast (104%), and Smolensk Oblast (103%). Russian monthly inflation hit a record high in November, rising over 1.5 times compared to October, according to RosStat. During the week of Nov. 19-25, the consumer price index increased by 0.36%, up 1.15% from the beginning of the month and over 8% from the beginning of the year. Overall food inflation exceeded 10% for the first time since January 2023, the Moscow Times reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/coffin-prices-in-russia-have-soared-by-74-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-media-reports/	2024-12-05T11:23:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1870879351.jpg
Ukrainian forces regain control of Novyi Komar village in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian troops have driven Russian units out of Novyi Komar village in Donetsk Oblast, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, told Suspilne media on Dec. 5. Novyi Komar, a village with a pre-war population of less than 500 people, is located about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of the Russian-occupied town of Vuhledar. &quot;The enemy was driven out of there,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;The village of Novyi Komar is under the control of the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces.&quot; A day before, crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that soldiers of the 48th Separate Assault Battalion regained control of the village. Russian forces suffered heavy losses, and some Russian soldiers fled to the highway near the village, according to DeepState. At the same time, Ukraine&apos;s counteroffensive actions are not as significant as Russia&apos;s ongoing assaults in the country&apos;s east. Russia captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in one week in mid-November, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Ukrainian officials have also increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms are not flowing in as fast as Kyiv has hoped.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-regain-control-of-novyi-komar-village-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-12-05T10:49:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181306801.jpg
Carol of the Bells — the classic, and Ukrainian, Christmas song	Editor&apos;s note: For the holiday season, the Kyiv Independent has created a unique collection dedicated to Carol of the Bells. Shop now on our e-store. Concertgoers filled Carnegie Hall on a rainy Thursday in October 1922 for a 35-piece performance by the Ukrainian National Choir. It was the first stop on an American tour to promote Ukrainian culture after the fall of the short-lived independent Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic in 1921 to the Bolsheviks. Tucked into the first half of the performance was a brief acappella arrangement of a pagan New Year&#x2019;s folk tale called &#x201C;Shchedryk&#x201D; (meaning bountiful in Ukrainian) composed by Ukrainian music teacher, Mykola Leontovych. Little did the crowd know that they were seeing the debut of a melody that would be recast by an American school teacher of Ukrainian descent and become one of the most famous Christmas songs in modern times &#x2014; &#x201C;Carol of the Bells.&#x201D; In 1908, Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych was forced to flee his job as a singing teacher at a railway school in Hryshyno, Donetsk Oblast, after ongoing pressure from local authorities for his participation in riots during the Russian Revolution of 1905. After fleeing, he settled in the town of Tulchyn in his native Vinnytsia Oblast, where he took up teaching and composing choral works based on Ukrainian folk songs, including &#x201C;Shchedryk.&#x201D; Mykola Leontovych in an undated photo. (Wikimedia)The song that would become famous for harmonizing multiple voices was first performed during a Christmas concert by the student choir of the University of Kyiv on Dec. 29, 1916. Today, the place where Ukrainians and English speakers are most likely to hear the melody is in the 1992 comedy &quot;Home Alone.&quot; As one of the first cultural imports from the West after declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, it consistently ranks in the top 10 most-watched movies in Ukraine. Former conductor of the Boston Pops, John Williams, who also scored the film, told the New York Times, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t particularly recall who suggested its inclusion in the film, but it was used to great effect in the church scene where the young protagonist first decides to protect his home from the villains of the story.&#x201D; The holiday film&#x2019;s theme of defending your home against invaders resonates today as Ukraine celebrates Christmas during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. It&#x2019;s unclear when the first Christmas folk songs appeared, but what&#x2019;s shared across many cultures is that their plots were not originally about Christmas. Carols in English, &quot;yules&quot; in German and &quot;koliady&quot; in many Slavic languages historically have had plots that focus on pagan customs related to New Year&#x2019;s celebrations. In Ukrainian this genre is called &quot;shchedrivky,&quot; hence the original song title of &#x201C;Shchedryk.&#x201D; Prior to the adoption of Christianity and the Julian calendar in 988, Ukrainians celebrated the new year in April with a carol-filled festival called &quot;Malanka&quot; or &quot;Shchedryi Vechir&quot; which means bountiful evening. The song tells the story of a swallow returning in spring to find a man with a beautiful wife whose estate is filled with healthy livestock and money. These lyrics follow the tradition of the &quot;shchedrivky&quot; genre which praises the host of the house, compliments their family, and wishes them prosperity.

After Ukraine declared independence from the tsarist regime in 1918, Leontovych returned to Kyiv where he taught at the recently established Music and Drama Institute and worked closely with Oleksandr Koshyts to develop the repertoire for the Ukrainian National Choir. The choir aimed to increase awareness of Ukrainian culture abroad in order to gain support for the newly formed state. During the two years of European touring between 1919-21, 80 singers performed in 45 cities across 10 countries in Europe. The second leg of the European tour premiered in Paris with a series of shows at the Champs-Elysees Theatre which concluded with a matinee on Sunday, Jan. 23, 1921. Just hours earlier, Leontovych had been shot in his father&#x2019;s home by an undercover agent of the Soviet secret police known as Cheka. He had come to spend the Orthodox Christmas season with his family. The agent had posed as a traveler in need of lodging, then shot him in his sleep. The murder of a rising star of Ukrainian music contributed to the larger Soviet goal of obliterating the Ukrainian intelligentsia &#x2013; a strikingly similar story to the murder of conductor Yuriy Kerpatenko in 2022 after he refused to perform in a Russian organized online day of music in the occupied city of Kherson. In late September 1922, a skeleton choral crew of 50 singers took the Ukrainian National Choir&#x2019;s show to North America. Before the tour, they spent a week in New York City recording their most popular works with Brunswick record company including the first known recording of &#x201C;Shchedryk.&#x201D; The song was performed at Carnegie Hall on Thursday, Oct. 5, 1922. The New York Tribune called the choir, &#x201C;a marvel of technical skill.&#x201D; A correspondent for the The Globe and Commercial wrote that the audience was &#x201C;captivated by this choral singing.&#x201D; Since then, the Ukrainian version of the song has been performed 70 times in Carnegie Hall alone. Among the Ukrainian National Choir&#x2019;s audience was Peter Wilhousky, a choral director and New York City public school administrator of Ukrainian descent. When he heard &#x201C;Shchedryk&quot; he was inspired by the bell-like melody of the song and asked the performers for notes. Wilhousky wrote a letter to the Ukrainian musicologist Roman Sawycky noting that, &#x201C;Since the young people would not sing in Ukrainian, I had to write English lyrics. I removed the Ukrainian words about &#x201C;swallows&#x201D; and instead focused on the cheerful ringing of bells that I heard in the music.&#x201D; Thus, &#x2018;Carol of the Bells&#x2019; was born. The English language version was first recorded in 1936 by Wilhousky&#x2019;s school choir during a popular radio program called &quot;Music Appreciation Hour&quot; hosted by the National Broadcasting Company. Shortly after its debut, the English sheet music was published inspiring performances nationwide. The Ukrainian Republican Kapelle with conductor Alexander Koshetz in Prague in 1919.

The melody also served as a symbol of light and hope in the 2022 Ukrainian-Polish historical drama, &quot;Shchedryk,&quot; which tells the story of three families united by the common grief of life under the Third Reich. A Facebook post about the film&#x2019;s release by Derzhkino, the Ukrainian state cinema, notes that, &#x201C;it is difficult for us (Ukrainians) to feel the traditional spirit of Christmas, and the sounds of sirens may be louder than the sounds of carols, but we respect our traditions and are proud of our &quot;Shchedryk&quot; by Mykola Leontovich, which is known all over the world!&#x201D; Children wearing traditional Ukrainian outfits sing Christmas carols during the festivities marking the Orthodox Christmas in Pirohovo village, not far from Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 7, 2022.

Ukrainian forces to receive 30,000 DeepStrike drones in 2025 as part of Zelensky's resilience plan, minister says	The Ukrainian military will get over 30,000 DeepStrike attack drones in 2025 within President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s resilience plan, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Dec. 5. According to Umerov, DeepStrike drones are of the new generation, capable of &quot;operating autonomously over long distances and hitting targets with high accuracy.&quot; &quot;We are demonstrating to the world that Ukraine is capable of innovation and technological independence. Even in wartime, we are developing cutting-edge production and strengthening our defense capabilities,&quot; Umerov said. Zelensky presented a 10-point resilience plan to the Ukrainian parliament on Nov. 19, which includes measures to stabilize the front line, increase the technological capabilities of Ukrainian forces, and overcome bureaucracy in the army. The production of part of the DeepStrike drones that will be supplied to the Ukrainian army next year was financed by international partners who invested in the Ukrainian defense industry, according to Umerov. The minister did not say how these drones will be distributed among Ukrainian troops. Ukraine is working to scale up domestic defense production, aiming to produce 1.5 million drones by the end of 2024. There is a &quot;significant volume&quot; of new and long-term orders for first-person-view (FPV) drones, reconnaissance drones, long-range drones, and missile-drones, Zelensky said on Dec. 3. Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields and logistics, as well as oil refineries and depots.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-to-receive-30-000-deepstrike-drones-in-2025-as-part-of-zelenskys-resilience-plan-minister-says/	2024-12-05T09:19:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150742300.jpg
30 years ago today, Ukraine traded nuclear arms for security assurances, a decision that still haunts Kyiv today	On Dec. 5, 1994, Ukraine had signed a set of political agreements that would guarantee the country&apos;s sovereignty and independence in return for accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Signed in Budapest, the memorandum would lay grounds for Ukraine to dispose of its nuclear arsenal in return for the U.S., the U.K. and Russia to guarantee to not use economic and military means to attack the country. Twenty years after signing the agreement, Russia launched a war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years in, Russia is actively conducting a full-scale offensive against Ukraine, burning the cities and killing the people it once promised to protect. The shadow of the events of 1994 haunts Ukraine today. Despite the agreements, Ukraine did not receive the main benefit of giving up the world&apos;s third-largest nuclear potential &#x2014; security. Many in Kyiv believe the country was pressured into an unequal agreement by the parties that had no intention to abide by what they had signed. &quot;Today, the Budapest Memorandum is a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry&apos;s statement read ahead of the 30th anniversary of the agreement. &quot;It should serve as a reminder to the current leaders of the Euro-Atlantic community that building a European security architecture at the expense of Ukraine&apos;s interests, rather than taking them into consideration, is destined to failure.&quot; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was left with 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles, including 130 liquid-fueled SS-19 Stiletto and 46 solid-fueled SS-24 Scalpel, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). Ukraine also had between 1,514 and 2,156 strategic nuclear warheads and 2,800 to 4,200 tactical nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Yet, Ukraine was not destined to keep its nuclear arsenal. The provision on non-nuclear status was enshrined in the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, adopted by the Ukrainian parliament on July 16, 1990. The provisions on the future nuclear status were also confirmed when Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Within less than a year, Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine, approved the Lisbon Protocol. The protocol supplemented the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) signed between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in 1984. The U.S., Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan also became signatories to the protocol. According to the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan pledged to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), thereby renouncing their nuclear status. On Dec. 5, 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum. According to the document, the signatory countries &#x2014; the U.K., Russia, and the U.S. &#x2014; pledged to be guarantors of Ukraine&apos;s independence, as well as sovereignty, and refrained from using weapons or economic pressure against Ukraine. In exchange, Ukraine renounced its nuclear status. Ukrainian police load a protester into a police van after arresting them in front of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on Jan. 12, 1996.

(Mikhail Chernichkin/AFP via Getty Images)Anton Liagusha, the academic director of the master&apos;s program in Memory Studies and Public History at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), says that Ukraine agreed to a non-nuclear status under enormous pressure. &quot;Russia used the Budapest Memorandum very cunningly. To be more precise, it encouraged and coerced the West to pressure Ukraine to sign the memorandum. At the same time, Russia positioned it as &apos;a noble act of global geopolitics,&apos;&quot; Liagusha said. &quot;Russia promoted the narrative that Ukraine is a failed state, a non-existent state, and non-existent means uncontrolled. And in a non-existent uncontrolled state, nuclear weapons are the worst possible option. Unfortunately, this cunning and sneaky diplomacy and propaganda reached their goals.&quot; Ukraine entirely fulfilled its agreements in 1996: all nuclear warheads were transferred to Russia for destruction, and classified strategic bases were converted to non-military use. The guarantors, on the other hand, did not fulfill their obligations. The historian described this step as a mistake because he firmly believes that today, nuclear weapons are still a guarantee of non-aggression and a certain guarantee of protecting one&apos;s sovereignty. &quot;At the time of signing the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine was not able to ensure its sovereignty in the event of direct military aggression by Russia or some other states,&quot; Liagusha told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This means that giving up nuclear weapons is a ridiculous story. And I am sure the politicians who signed this memorandum understood this.&quot; Other experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent noted that disarmament had some positive aspects. Ukraine did not have access to the launch codes, but Russia did. Therefore, Ukraine could only store the weapons and not use them, but the storage also required a lot of resources. &quot;You need to keep constant security personnel at the sites, make sure that the warheads and missiles remain stable, and that there are no issues with them,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukraine would have paid substantial amounts for something it cannot use. So, it would not have been very smart (to keep the weapons).&quot; According to Hoffman, Ukraine also risked becoming an international pariah like Iran or North Korea if it kept its nuclear warheads. Liviu Horovitz, a nuclear deterrence specialist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, shared the same opinion. &quot;Everybody wanted Ukraine to give up those nuclear weapons, including the U.S. and all Western European powers. And hence, Ukraine basically would have had to take this decision against everybody else&apos;s will,&quot; Horovitz told the Kyiv Independent.

(Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images)In exchange for giving up nuclear weapons, Ukraine also received economic benefits in the form of fuel for nuclear power plants. In the early 1990s, Ukraine was experiencing a financial crisis, and rolling blackouts were occurring nationwide. Thus, by giving up strategic bombers, Ukraine partially paid off its gas debts. However, Horovitz agreed with Liagusha, saying that in the event of a full-scale invasion, nuclear weapons could help Ukraine in its defense against Russia. &quot;It is not like you acquire one lonely nuclear weapon, and suddenly, all foreign threats vanish. But historically, nuclear powers have better deterred their adversaries. Given Ukraine&apos;s conflict with the Russian Federation, probably it would not have been a bad idea, from a Ukrainian perspective, to own a nuclear arsenal,&quot; Horovitz said. However, both Horovitz and Hoffman said that they do not see any short-term solutions for Ukraine, adding that the Ukrainian nuclear arsenal is the story of the past with no prospects in the future. This fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky stirred up a new wave of discussions around the memorandum and the fulfillment of its terms. &quot;Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance. Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance,&quot; he said in October. Following the statement, Zelensky had to justify himself amid growing concerns of partners and ensure that Kyiv had no plans to develop new nuclear weapons but expected to join the alliance in the future. Yet, he once again highlighted the numerous violations of the Budapest Memorandum.

(Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;This means it is not a good &apos;umbrella&apos; for our security. That is why I said that I have no alternative but NATO. It was my signal.&quot; Liagusha echoed Zelensky&apos;s stance, saying that the Budapest Memorandum turned out to be completely &quot;empty,&quot; as there was no actual mechanism to protect Ukraine. The Ukrainian historian argued that Ukraine should now invest in the development of nuclear weapons, while Hoffman and Horovitz remained more skeptical about this idea. Ukraine does not have costly energy infrastructure that would be able to handle plutonium separation or uranium enrichment, the processes used to make nuclear weapons, Hoffman said. According to the expert, it can take &quot;months, if not years,&quot; to construct the necessary facilities. Ukraine will also not be able to do this quietly, as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducts so-called nuclear accounting, tracking all nuclear material inside any country with a nuclear power program. &quot;Because it could not be kept secret, you would have all those political drawbacks. This would not be very welcome abroad,&quot; Hoffman said. &quot;Russia would have every incentive to preempt a Ukrainian nuclear weapon&#x2026; If Ukraine takes this further, there might be a nuclear preemption. But it would also be dangerous from a military perspective.&quot; Liagusha, on the other hand, saw no reason to be cautious about Ukraine&apos;s potential development of new nuclear weapons. In the historian&apos;s view, there is no point in fearing an escalation of the war at this stage. &quot;We are in a situation of war and social catastrophe when we have little to lose but our own lives,&quot; Liagusha said. &quot;And Europe is as weak as it has ever been.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/30-years-ago-ukraine-traded-nuclear-arms-for-security-assurances-a-decision-that-haunts-kyiv-today/	2024-12-05T08:05:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-50606619-1.jpg
Russia illegally drafted 5,500 residents of occupied Crimea in 2024, Kyiv says	Nearly 5,500 residents of Russian-occupied Crimea were mobilized into the Russian army in 2024, according to the report of the Mission of the President of Ukraine in Crimea, published on Dec. 4. Russian forces have experienced record personnel losses in 2024 amid ramped-up offensive operations in Ukraine&apos;s east. The Kremlin has avoided instituting likely unpopular full-scale mobilization, seeking instead to find recruits among volunteers, migrant workers, residents of poorer regions, and occupied territories in Ukraine. Russia has been illegally mobilizing residents of Crimea since the peninsula&apos;s occupation in 2014 in violation of the norms and customs of international humanitarian law. A total of nearly 50,000 residents of occupied Crimea have been mobilized into the Russian army through illegal conscription campaigns since 2014, according to the report. &#xA0; Russian-installed authorities have been persecuting and detaining residents of the occupied peninsula due to their political views, ethnicity, or religion. Those who refuse to serve in the Russian Armed Forces also face punishment, including criminal charges. According to the Mission of the President of Ukraine in Crimea, Russian prosecutors have started 553 criminal proceedings under the article &quot;evasion of military service,&quot; 244 of which were initiated after Feb. 24, 2022, when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimean residents were found guilty in over 497 of these cases. During the nearly 11 years of occupation, Russia has been in particular targeting the peninsula&apos;s indigenous Crimean Tatar population, which has been particularly vocal in resisting the occupation. As of Nov. 26, 2024, 218 people are illegally detained in Russian prisons, including 132 Crimean Tatars. Most of them are activists, human rights defenders, and journalists who remain patriots of Ukraine, the report read.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-illegally-drafted-5-500-residents-of-occupied-crimea-in-2024-kyiv-says/	2024-12-05T07:52:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1213863463.jpg
EU prepared to step in if Trump withdraws from $50 billion Ukraine loan, official says	Polish Deputy Finance Minister Pawel Karbownik said on Dec. 4 that the European Union is prepared to compensate if the U.S. withdraws from the G7&apos;s $50 billion multilateral loan agreement for Ukraine. The loan, agreed upon by G7 countries in October, is designed to be repaid using interest from over $300 billion in frozen Russian assets under Western control. &quot;There is a risk that Donald Trump will pull out of the $50 billion agreement,&quot; Karbownik warned during an event marking Poland&apos;s upcoming presidency of the EU Council, Politico reported. Under the agreement, the EU and the U.S. were to contribute $20 billion each, with the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan funding the remainder. Faced with the possibility of the U.S. withdrawal, Brussels signed an agreement with Kyiv to raise its potential contribution to up to 35 billion euros. The final sum provided by the EU will depend on the scale of the U.S.&apos;s involvement. Concerns have grown as U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican and Trump ally, has resisted putting a $24 billion Ukraine aid package to a vote. Johnson previously delayed aid to Kyiv last fall by stalling a $61 billion foreign assistance bill, though he ultimately negotiated its passage. As the Biden administration accelerates aid deliveries before Trump assumes office in January, uncertainty over U.S. support for Ukraine looms. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Ukraine should receive the loan from the U.S. and the EU within the coming weeks. Trump has criticized military assistance for Ukraine and said he aims to push for negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow, potentially requiring Ukraine to cede territory and temporarily abandon its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-prepared-to-step-in-if-us-withdraws-from-50-billion-ukraine-loan/	2024-12-05T06:09:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
At least 6 Ukrainian mayors held captive by Russia, Zelensky says	At least six Ukrainian mayors and community heads remain in Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 5 during an address to the human rights community. Zelensky confirmed that Yevhenii Matvieiev, the mayor of occupied Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, died in Russian captivity. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said that Matvieiev was tortured to death. Matvieiev was captured in March 2022 while trying to assist residents of his community. &quot;They are among thousands of Ukrainians who are innocent but have been in captivity for years. And not only since 2022, but also since 2014,&quot; Zelensky said. The president assured that Ukraine is doing everything possible to secure the release of its citizens. Over 19,500 Ukrainian children remain in Russian captivity, while only 3,767 have been freed. Zelensky criticized the global response, noting the lack of significant action to stop Russia&#x2019;s crimes and punish those responsible. &quot;There are still few voices in the world that speak about Ukrainian children abducted by Russia,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that discussions about &quot;freezing&quot; the war often ignore the fate of millions of Ukrainians and hundreds of thousands of children in occupied territories. The president expressed regret over the fading international focus on Russian war crimes. &quot;Even the most large-scale Russian war crimes are gradually being forgotten by many in the world and in Europe, at the political level, among those who could act to fix everything,&quot; he emphasized. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in captivity, according to Victoria Tsymbaliuk of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-six-ukrainian-mayors-held-captive-by-russia-zelensky-says/	2024-12-05T05:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg
Discussions about German peacekeepers in Ukraine 'irresponsible,' opposition leader says	Germany&apos;s conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz said on Dec. 4 that any speculations about deploying German troops to ensure a ceasefire are irresponsible at this time. The CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate was reacting to recent comments by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who said that a deployment of German troops in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire should not be ruled out. &quot;The war in Ukraine continues, Russia continues to act cruelly against the civilian population,&quot; Merz said, speaking at an ARD program. &quot;We are all thinking about how to end this war. The question is how to achieve this,&quot; he added, saying nobody is asking a question about a peacekeeper deployment. The comments come amid an escalating election campaign as Germany approaches a snap vote in February. While Merz has criticized Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his supposed hesitance in supporting Ukraine &#x2014; particularly concerning the provision of Taurus missiles &#x2014; his views on troop deployment appear to be closer to those of the incumbent chancellor. Speaking in Germany&apos;s parliament, Scholz ruled out the possibility of deploying German troops to Ukraine at this stage. He stressed that there is an agreement with Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on the matter, adding that the Green Party&apos;s foreign minister was giving a &quot;diplomatic answer&quot; about a future hypothetical situation. The chancellor avoided a question about deploying peacekeepers after a possible ceasefire. Pistorius, Scholz&apos;s fellow Social Democrat, said there are still too many unknowns but did not rule out the possibility. &quot;If there is a ceasefire and if it then comes to the point where someone &#x2014; whoever it is &#x2014; plans to use military means to ensure peace, that would depend on the type of mandate, the scope, the requirements, and the acceptance by the warring parties,&quot; Pistorius said, as quoted by German media. The comments follow unconfirmed media reports about the U.K. and France discussing sending its soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine. European troops overseeing a peaceful post-war situation in the country were reportedly also included in a peace plan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-on-german-peacekeepers-in-ukraine/	2024-12-05T05:47:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Russia increasing presence, provocations in Baltic Sea, German minister says	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Dec. 5 that Russia has significantly increased its naval and civilian presence in the Baltic Sea, highlighting its strategic importance for Moscow. The comments came shortly after a Russian warship fired a warning shot at a German military helicopter patrolling the Baltic Sea. Speaking to Deutschlandfunk, Pistorius noted that the Chinese fleet has also appeared periodically in the region. &quot;This demonstrates the strategic importance of the Baltic Sea for many, especially for Russia and China, including circumventing sanctions,&quot; he said. Pistorius criticized Russia&apos;s provocative behavior, likening it to tactics used during the Cold War. &quot;We have repeatedly had incidents in the Baltic Sea that led to warning shots in the air, warning shots in the water,&quot; he said, referencing incidents where Russian fighter jets flew over Baltic states without identification markings to test NATO&#x2019;s response. Meanwhile, Swedish authorities are investigating damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea, with suspicions involving the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3. On Nov. 20, the Financial Times reported that the ship&#x2019;s movements near the damaged cables were under scrutiny, citing undisclosed sources. The growing tensions and increased activity underscore the Baltic Sea&#x2019;s critical role in security and geopolitics amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-increasing-presence-provocations-in-baltic-sea-pistorius-says/	2024-12-05T05:09:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/40376926_2181642765411801_4095442172197732352_n.jpg
Ukrainian intelligence hackers disrupt Russia's Gazprombank, source says	Cyber specialists from Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) successfully attacked the systems of Gazprombank, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest banks, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 5. The cyberattack, described as a powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) assault, disrupted Gazprombank&apos;s online and mobile banking services. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. &quot;Hundreds of thousands of Russians will be unable to transfer money and carry out online payments due to Gapzormank applications not working,&quot; the source said. Russian state media confirmed on Dec. 4 issues with access to the bank&apos;s website. The attack reportedly rendered Gazprombank&#x2019;s website inaccessible in France and Germany, with its mobile application also experiencing outages. Gazprombank serves around 3 million individuals and 45,000 businesses and is a critical financial institution in Russia. This disruption follows sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury on Gazprombank on Nov. 21, further targeting the bank amid ongoing efforts to pressure Russia over its war against Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine have widely employed cyber warfare during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, targeting businesses and government institutions with crippling hacker attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-gazprombank-cyberattack/	2024-12-05T04:56:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258690185.jpg
There will be no Yalta-2 or Minsk-3,' Ukrainian FM says at OSCE meeting	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, speaking at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) meeting in Malta on Dec. 5, strongly opposed any agreements resembling past Yalta or Minsk deals that could legitimize Russian aggression. The comments come as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to put a swift end to the war in Ukraine and bring both sides to the negotiating table. &quot;Russia wants a second Yalta or at least a third Minsk. It wants a world of zones of influence where power dictates the rules, changes borders, and deprives people of their right to freedom. But we are clear: there will be no Yalta-2 or Minsk-3,&quot; Sybiha said during a closed-door meeting. This referenced the 1945 Yalta conference on dividing post-World War II spheres of power in Europe between the USSR and Western powers and the unsuccessful 2014-15 Minsk I and II agreements on ending the war in Donbas. The minister accused Russia of using &quot;peace plans&quot; as a pretext to continue its aggression. &quot;We have seen what Russian peace means in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium. For them, it means mass graves, ruins of cities, and killed Ukrainian civilians. Ukrainian children are abducted, their names are changed, and they are forcibly assimilated into Russian culture,&quot; he said. Sybiha added that Russia is not genuinely interested in negotiations, urging the international community to focus on Moscow&#x2019;s actions rather than its words. &quot;Russia continues to expand the war,&quot; he warned. The OSCE meeting in Malta was also attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, marking his first visit to the EU since the start of the full-scale war. Sybiha called Lavrov a war criminal and left the OSCE plenary hall in protest ahead of Lavrov&#x2019;s address. Several other foreign ministers and diplomats followed suit in a coordinated walkout.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-yalta-minsk/	2024-12-05T04:32:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg
A more dangerous Russia' — UK armed forces chief issues stark 'third nuclear age' warning	The world faces the dawn of a &quot;third nuclear age&quot; in which Western democracies are threatened by &quot;authoritarian states seeking to challenge the global rules,&quot; the head of the U.K.&apos;s armed forces said on Dec. 4. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said &quot;wild threats of tactical nuclear use&quot; by Russia were one of the gravest concerns, along with its deepening alliances with North Korea and Iran. &quot;This year&#x2019;s most extraordinary development was the deployment of thousands of North Korean soldiers on the border of Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;Add to this the use of Iranian-supplied drones by Russian forces, and Russia&#x2019;s threats to arm the Houthis in direct retaliation for Western support to Ukraine, and we are witnessing the world aligning into three groups.&quot; Radakin said the first of these is the &quot;authoritarian states&quot; of Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea that sought to challenge and disrupt the global order. The second is &quot;the responsible nations of the world,&quot; while the third consists of countries such as India and Brazil who are &quot;hedging and ducking between the two for maximum advantage.&quot; Radakin added the third nuclear age &#x2014; after the escalation of the Cold War, and then the disarmament efforts and counter-proliferation that followed &#x2014; would be characterized by &quot;proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies, and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before.&quot; &quot;From Russia we have seen wild threats of tactical nuclear use, large-scale nuclear exercises and simulated attacks against NATO countries, all designed to coerce us from taking the action required to maintain stability,&quot; he added. Despite the dire warning, Radakin insisted there was only a &quot;remote chance&quot; Russia would directly attack or invade a NATO country due to the alliance&apos;s nuclear umbrella. &quot;Russia knows the response would be overwhelming, whether conventional or nuclear,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The strategy of deterrence by NATO works and is working. &quot;But it has to be kept strong and strengthened against a more dangerous Russia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/a-more-dangerous-russia-uk-armed-forces-chief-issues-stark-third-nuclear-age-warning/	2024-12-05T04:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2165479264.jpg
Russia's losses may begin to outpace enlistment rates, media's analysis says	Russia&apos;s contract soldier recruitment rate may have dropped in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, the Meduza news outlet reported on Dec. 4, citing its analysis of Russia&apos;s federal budget. Based on the conclusions from expenditures for sign-on bonuses and earlier research, Meduza estimates that the Russian military signed between 500 and 600 new contracts per day. This would be less or barely enough to cover Russia&apos;s irreversible battlefield losses, estimated by Meduza at 600-750 per day, including 200-250 fatalities. If accurate, these figures indicate a tipping point in Moscow&apos;s ability to compensate its casualties in its full-scale war in Ukraine. Despite the war being Russia&apos;s deadliest conflict since World War II, observers believed the country could substitute them through volunteers and limited &quot;covert&quot; mobilization. According to the analysis&apos;s more liberal estimates, Russia may have signed up to 82,000 new contracts in the third quarter if bonuses had been budgeted with delays and, therefore, according to earlier lower levels. Russian President Vladimir Putin hiked the sign-on bonuses earlier this year to attract more recruits for the war. The lump-sum payment went from 195,000 rubles (now $1,900) to 400,000 rubles (now $3,900) in August. The figure of 82,000 would still decrease from roughly 93,000 contracts concluded in the previous quarter. The most conservative scenario, disregarding possible delays, put the number of contracts in the third quarter at 49,000, which could come down to the said 500-600 losses per day. Federal budget reports show that Russia spent 48.56 billion rubles ($472.6 million) between the start of the year and Oct. 1. The Kremlin has avoided instituting likely unpopular full-scale mobilization, seeking instead to find recruits among migrant workers and residents of poorer regions. More recently, Russia&apos;s manpower capacity was boosted by a dispatch of 10,000-12,000 North Korean troops. Russian forces have advanced in eastern Ukraine at a long-unseen pace over the past few months, albeit at the cost of record losses. In turn, Ukraine struggles more with offsetting its losses, with Ukrainian commanders complaining about understaffed units on the front as the mobilization drive slows. These factors are likely to play a role in any possible negotiations, a possibility discussed increasingly frequently in the world&apos;s capitals.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-losses-may-now-outpace-enlistment-rates-medias-analysis-says/	2024-12-05T04:03:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Ukraine sees no signs Russia is ready for peace talks, Zelensky's top aide says	The Ukrainian government has observed no indication that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful peace negotiations, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 4. &quot;They only want to dictate and speak the language of ultimatums,&quot; Yermak said in an interview for The Telegraph. He emphasized that no leader of the democratic world, including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, would allow such ultimatums. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has raised concerns about the stability of Western support for Ukraine, as he has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring the conflict to a swift conclusion. Yermak also underlined that the war remains constant and relentless, stressing the urgent need for additional weapons and equipment. &quot;The war continues every minute. Our partners know exactly what we need. We work with them every day. The level of our communication is excellent. However, every day of fighting leads to losses of our people,&quot; he added. On the same day, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the meeting, that a Ukrainian delegation led by Yermak met with Trump&apos;s top aides in Washington. The delegation, which included Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, met with incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg, the source told Reuters. In an interview with Sky News, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated that NATO membership for territories under Ukrainian government control is essential to ending the &quot;hot phase of the war.&quot; He insisted that any invitation to join NATO should acknowledge Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sees-no-signs-russia-is-ready-for-peace-talks-yermak-says/	2024-12-05T02:48:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Lavrov arrives in Malta on his first EU visit since full-scale war's start; Sybiha also present	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov traveled to Malta to participate in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Ministerial Meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on its Telegram channel on Dec. 5. This marks Lavrov&apos;s first visit to an EU country since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is also visiting Malta to address the plenary session of the OSCE meeting. Ukraine&apos;s chief diplomat left the hall before the start of Lavrov&apos;s speech, calling him a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Several other ministers joined Sybiha in the walkout. Lavrov last visited an EU nation in 2021 for the OSCE meeting in Stockholm. He attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York multiple times during the war. Despite being under EU sanctions, which include a travel ban, exceptions can be made for attendance at international meetings within EU territory. The visit came amid controversy after Malta canceled a visa for Maria Zakharova, the official spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, citing &quot;circumstances beyond their control,&quot; according to Zakharova. According to Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry, Sybiha is set to hold bilateral talks with counterparts from partner countries, focusing on the consequences of Russian aggression and advocating for a comprehensive and just peace based on Ukraine&#x2019;s peace formula.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-malta/	2024-12-05T02:34:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
48,000 Russian soldiers may be MIA in Ukraine, Putin's relative reveals	Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova let slip on Nov. 26 that the ministry had received 48,000 applications for DNA tests from relatives seeking information about soldiers missing in action during the war against Ukraine, opposition Telegram news channel Astra reported on Dec. 3. At a roundtable in the Russian State Duma, Tsivilyova &#x2013; Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s cousin once removed &#x2013; revealed that relatives&apos; DNA had been collected and stored in a database. Her comments provide rare insight into the number of missing Russian troops, as no official statistics on these figures have been released. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, responded by cautioning against publicly discussing such numbers. &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we should ensure these figures do not appear publicly,&quot; Kartapolov said. Tsivilyova clarified that the figure she cited referred to the number of relatives&apos; appeals, not confirmed missing soldiers. &quot;Many of them will be found. Therefore, this figure reflects appeals, not statistics,&quot; she added. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces, Russia has lost 748,950 troops since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-48000-mia/	2024-12-05T01:41:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
Ukraine sanctions Georgian government amid crackdown on EU-protests	Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky signed on Dec. 5 sanctions against Georgian government officials who are, in his words, &quot;surrendering Georgia to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.&quot; The sanctions target Bidzina Ivanishvili, an oligarch with business ties in Russia who is seen as the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, and 18 other individuals. The announcement came amid the latest wave of anti-government protests that broke out in Tbilisi and other cities after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said the country&apos;s EU accession process had been postponed until at least 2028. The ensuing police crackdown, which led to hundreds of arrests and at least dozens of injured protesters, prompted an international backlash. Opposition leaders and journalists were among those assaulted and detained. &quot;This is how it works in international affairs: if you do not respond in time or fail to respond with principle, then decades are lost, and countries are robbed of their freedom,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address published on his Telegram channel. The sanctions list further includes Prime Minister Kobakhidze, Tbilisi mayor Kakha Kaladze, State Security Service chief Grigol Liluashvili, Interior Minister Vakhtang Gomelauri, head of the pro-government TV channel Imedi, Irakli Rukhadze, and others. &quot;We must not lose anyone in this region &#x2013; neither Georgia, nor Moldova, nor Ukraine. We must stand united in defending ourselves against Moscow,&quot; Zelensky added. In power since 2012, Georgian Dream has been accused of encroaching on the country&apos;s democracy and press freedom and dragging the country back into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law prompted mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Zelensky appealed to partners in Europe and the U.S. to join the efforts and &quot;act with principle.&quot; Earlier this week, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia said they would bar Georgian Dream government officials entry in response to the crackdown. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined the condemnations against Georgia&apos;s ruling party, not ruling out imposing additional sanctions on top of those announced earlier this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sanctions-georgian-government/	2024-12-05T01:18:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2185881733--1-.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 6 over past day	Russian attacks over the past day killed at least two people and injured six others across Ukraine, regional authorities reported on Dec. 5. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force intercepted 30 of 44 Russian drones launched overnight. Russia also fired two Iskander-M ballistic missiles during the assault, the Air Force reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian strike hit a residential area, killing a 40-year-old man. His mother and another woman suffered acute stress reactions. In Kupiansk, a drone strike wounded a 65-year-old man, who was hospitalized, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed an 88-year-old woman and injured a 64-year-old man. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, the attack also damaged private homes and vehicles. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces wounded four residents&#x2014;three in Kostiantynivka and one in Shevchenkove, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force and Defense Forces intercepted drones targeting Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, and Odesa oblasts, where no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-dec-5/	2024-12-05T00:49:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Kharkiv-Oblast-Dec-5.jpg
Russia keeps North Korean soldiers away from direct combat, Ukraine's National Resistance Center claims	North Korean soldiers have been stationed at observation posts and checkpoints in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as a &quot;second echelon&quot; not involved in direct combat, the Ukrainian military-run National Resistance Center reported on Dec. 4. Pyongyang has dispatched between 10,000-12,000 troops to boost Russia&apos;s war in a sign of deepening cooperation between the two countries, deploying the soldiers to the embattled Kursk Oblast. Subordinated to Russia&#x2019;s 11th Airborne Assault Brigade, the North Korean forces guard areas where Russian troops are concentrated, the center said. Their deployment has reportedly allowed the Kremlin to reassign more Russian soldiers to front-line positions. Speaking to Kyodo News, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is treating the first batch of North Korean soldiers well to attract tens of thousands more. At the same time, Zelensky revealed that the first North Korean troops had been killed in the war without revealing the number. Separately, a Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson told the media that 2,000 North Korean troops have been assigned to Russia&apos;s Marine and airborne units fighting on the front. &quot;If they (North Korean troops) have joined units engaged in active hostilities, then we can confidently say that they have joined the fight,&quot; spokesperson Andrii Cherniak told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, adding that this might not necessarily mean deployment on front-line positions. &quot;Maybe they are not in advanced positions, but they enable aggression against Ukraine, ensure the killing of Ukrainian service members.&quot; Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also said on Nov. 27 that North Korean forces are &quot;actively supporting&quot; Russian attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. While Umerov did not provide specifics, North Korea supplied Russia with ballistic missiles and artillery shells throughout the full-scale invasion, bolstering Moscow&#x2019;s military capabilities. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either country comes under attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-deploys-north-korean-soldiers-at-checkpoints-near-kursk/	2024-12-05T00:11:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Netherlands announces $23 million for Ukraine's air defense, cyber resilience	The Netherlands will contribute an additional $23 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and cyber resilience, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp announced on X on Dec. 4. The announcement followed Veldkamp&apos;s meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha during a NATO-Ukraine Council meeting. Veldkamp emphasized the need for NATO and its allies to address third countries aiding Russia&#x2019;s war effort. &quot;This demands a more robust and coordinated response from NATO and its Allies,&quot; he wrote. This support comes amid increased Western efforts to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses. On Dec. 2, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken unveiled a $725 million weapons package for Ukraine, which includes Stinger missiles, ammunition for HIMARS, 155 mm and 105 mm artillery shells, drones, and landmines. The Biden administration, approaching the end of its term, is prioritizing Kyiv&#x2019;s defense capabilities before the January transition of power. These measures aim to reinforce Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience as it continues to face Russian aggression. The Netherlands previously supplied Ukraine with several Patriot air defense launchers, most recently delivering three in November. The country also pledged to provide a full battery in cooperation with another unnamed partner, but the plan was never completed as the partner backed out.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-announces-23-million-for-ukraines-air-defense-and-cyber-resilience/	2024-12-04T23:34:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
Oreshnik strike planned before long-range strikes permission, Gerasimov reportedly told US military chief	Russian General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, held a rare phone call with U.S. General Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Nov. 27, The New York Times reported on Dec. 4. The conversation occurred just six days after Russia launched a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, at Dnipro in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the strike was in response to Ukraine&apos;s use of American and British weapons to target deeper within Russia. During the call, Gerasimov told Brown that the missile launch had been planned well before the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles for deeper strikes into Russian territory, undisclosed official sources told the New York Times. Captain Jereal Dorsey, a spokesperson for Brown, confirmed the call, noting that it was conducted at Gerasimov&apos;s request and that Brown agreed not to announce it proactively. The Nov. 21 Oreshnik missile strike on Dnipro prompted a media blitz in Russia. The Moscow Times on Dec. 3 described it as a carefully staged effort to intimidate Western allies. Four Russian official sources reportedly indicated that the strike was primarily meant to display strength rather than escalation. This undermines Putin&apos;s subsequent threats to use the Oreshnik missile to target &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv, which appear increasingly aimed at sowing fear rather than signaling imminent action.	https://kyivindependent.com/gerasimov-brown-oreshnik/	2024-12-04T23:06:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165190458.jpg
Romania targeted by 'aggressive Russian hybrid attacks,' authorities say amid elections	Romanian authorities on Dec. 4 declassified evidence of what they described as a &quot;highly organized&quot; social media campaign backed by a &quot;state actor&quot; to boost pro-Russian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu in a recent vote. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) pointed to &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; targeting Romania. Largely unknown ultranationalist Georgescu unexpectedly surged to first place with almost 23% on Nov. 24 and is set to face pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi in the runoff on Dec. 8. An independent candidate and a former member of the far-right AUR party, Georgescu has voiced admiration for Russia and its President Vladimir Putin and lambasted NATO and military aid for Ukraine. One of the reports, declassified by outgoing President Klaus Iohannis, says that Georgescu was boosted by a state actor-coordinated campaign on the Chinese-owned TikTok platform. The campaign was initially formed around 25,000 accounts that became highly active in the run-up to the elections. While the candidate claimed he spent no money from the campaign budget, intelligence identified one TikTok account that paid $381,000 to users promoting Georgescu. The agencies also reported 85,000 cyberattacks aimed at accessing and tampering with election data, with advanced methods indicative of &quot;state-sponsored actors.&quot; The campaign also used social media influencers, with a combined following of over 8 million, to influence public opinion in a similar fashion to the Russian information campaign in Ukraine before Moscow&apos;s aggression, the Romanian Interior Ministry said. &quot;Romanians must decide with their vote whether they want to hand over Romania to Russia as a gift,&quot; Lasconi said in light of the revelations. &quot;We have a choice between Russia and the EU.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-russia-elections/	2024-12-04T22:53:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187159702.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 748,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 748,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 5. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,506 tanks, 19,472 armored fighting vehicles, 30,843 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,023 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,020 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,977 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-748-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-04T22:19:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2133275817.jpg
Hungary requests US sanctions exemption for Russian natural gas payments	Budapest has requested the United States to provide the country with a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports through Gazprombank, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Dec. 4. The United States introduced new sanctions on Nov. 21, targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials. &quot;Yesterday, we filed our request with the relevant American authorities that calls for Gazprombank being granted an exception from sanctions when it comes to payments for natural gas,&quot; Szijjarto said, amid a visit to Washington ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration. After the sanction were initially announced, Szijjarto said on Nov. 22 that sanctions marked an &quot;attack on our sovereignty,&quot; deeming the implementation as a &quot;threat to energy security.&quot; The U.S. had previously refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments. Despite the past restraint, the U.S. Treasury Department said that the most recent sanctions &quot;will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The Financial Times noted in its reporting that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The new U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Hungary&apos;s request comes as Turkey has been in talks with the U.S. in it effort to receive its own sanctions waiver for Gazprombank. On Nov. 26, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters, that Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled gas company, is planning for a scenario in which no natural gas will flow to Europe through Ukraine after Dec. 31, 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-requests-us-sanctions-exemption-for-russian-natural-gas-payments/	2024-12-04T21:28:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252632914.jpg
Georgian police detain opposition leader amid protests	Georgian police detained Nika Gvaramia, the leader of the Coalition for Change opposition party on Dec. 4 amid government crackdown as pro-EU protests in the country continue. Gvaramia was dragged out by police from the party&apos;s office and shoved into a car in Tbilisi as authorities conducted searches against multiple opposition parties as well as non-governmental organizations. The latest wave of protests against the ruling Georgian Dream party broke out last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the suspension of the South Caucasus&apos; EU accession process until at least 2028. Over 330 people have been arrested during the ensuing crackdown as tens of thousands have joined the demonstrations, with police attempting to disperse the rally with teargas, water cannons, and arrests. In turn, the protesters have set up barricades and shot fireworks toward the riot police. Dozens have been injured during the crackdown, including journalists covering the rally. Pro-EU President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of Georgian Dream who joined the protests, said that the &quot;majority of the arrested protesters have injuries to their heads and faces, broken face bones, eye sockets, open wounds.&quot; Gvaramia, the former head of an opposition TV channel, previously served 13 months in jail for abuse of authority, charges that Amnesty International deemed as &quot;politically motivated.&quot; Zourabichvili granted Gvaramia a presidential pardoned in June 2023. Georgian Dream, which declared victory in the October elections broadly disputed by domestic opposition and international observers, has been accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. The prime minister previously thanked law enforcement services for preventing a &quot;Maidan&quot; from taking place in Georgia. This was a reference to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014-2014, where mass pro-EU demonstrations led to the ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-police-detain-opposition-leader-amid-protests/	2024-12-04T20:19:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg
Yermak-led delegation meets with Trump's team in Washington, Reuters reports	A Ukrainian delegation, led by Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, met with top aides to President-elect Donald Trump in Washington on Dec. 4, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the meeting. The delegation, which reportedly included Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, met with incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg, the source told Reuters. No details were immediately available as to any specific outcomes of the discussions. Trump&apos;s transition team did not respond to Reuters&apos; request for comment on the meeting. Both Waltz and Kellogg will play a key role in shaping expected future negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow after Trump is inaugurated in January. While Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions against Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration, outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Dec. 4 that Ukraine is set to receive $50 billion in frozen Russian assets held by the United States and the European Union in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; Also on Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that he will not put to a vote a request for an additional $24 billion in aid to Ukraine following reports that President Joe Biden was quietly asking Congress to green light further assistance to Kyiv before he leaves office.	https://kyivindependent.com/yermak-led-delegation-meets-with-trumps-team-in-washington-reuters-reports/	2024-12-04T19:05:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
84 arrested in UK-led crypto laundering investigation involving Russian oligarchs, spies	The United Kingdom&apos;s National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Dec. 4 that it had dismantled a multibillion-dollar money laundering scheme that has enabled criminal networks, including Russian spies and oligarchs, to evade sanctions using cryptocurrency. The criminal operations, described by investigators as a &quot;complex scheme,&quot; spanned over 30 countries. Criminal networks laundered proceeds from illegal activities to &quot;collect funds in one country and make the equivalent value available in another, often by swapping cryptocurrency for cash,&quot; according to the NCA. Investigators allege that two companies, Smart Group and TGR Group, served as a financial laundering hubs to various transnational criminal organizations, including the Irish Kinahan cartel, and Russian ransomware groups. In turn, funds were further laundered to allow Russian espionage networks and oligarchs &quot;to illegally bypass financial restrictions to invest money in the UK,&quot; according to a statement released by the NCA. The laundered funds also allowed oligarchs to purchase property in the United Kingdom. The criminal operation, which ran out of London, Moscow, and Dubai, primarily used the U.S. dollar-backed cryptocurrency Tether to the launder the money. Rob Jones, NCA director-general of operations, said that the investigation, which led to 84 arrests and 20 million pounds ($25.4 million) in seized assets, was &quot;the most significant money laundering operation&quot; that the agency had undertaken. On the day that the investigation, dubbed &quot;Operation Destabilize,&quot; was revealed, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions on five individuals and four entities associated with TGR Group. Following the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has faced severe financial sanctions from Western countries. Despite efforts effectively shut off the Russian economy from Western allies, Russia continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies. Russia is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea. As the war drags on, the economic toll of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has become more glaring with the purchasing power of the Russian ruble hitting the lowest point since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/84-arrested-in-uk-led-crypto-laundering-investigation-involving-russian-oligarchs-spies/	2024-12-04T18:18:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-500197418.jpg
Colombian man arrested in Romania for acting on Russian orders to plot infrastructure attack	A 34-year-old Colombian man has been arrested in Romania for allegedly planning to sabotage critical infrastructure under the direction of a Russian citizen. The suspect, who was detained on Nov. 13 and is now in pre-trial detention, is accused of targeting sites that could jeopardize national security, according to local media outlet Adevarul. The case is being heard by the Bucharest Court of Appeal, and if convicted, the man faces 10 to 20 years in prison under Article 403 of Romania&#x2019;s Penal Code, which covers acts of destruction endangering national security. Prosecutors allege that in July 2024, the man acted on instructions from a Russian citizen residing in Russia to prepare an attack on strategic Romanian infrastructure. The suspect reportedly carried out reconnaissance missions, photographing and recording potential targets he intended to destroy with explosives or fire. Authorities intervened before the plan could be finalized, according to the outlet. The suspect, described as having military training and expertise in intelligence-gathering from his home country, was arrested in a coordinated operation involving the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism, Romanian police, and local intelligence service. Investigators believe his actions were part of a broader effort to destabilize Romanian security interests. The arrest took place during a period of heightened concerns over Russian disinformation campaigns targeting Romania. Around the same time, the Ministry of National Defense reported multiple attempts by Russian entities to spread false information about similar acts of sabotage, exacerbating regional tensions.	https://kyivindependent.com/colombian-man-arrested-in-romania-for-acting-on-russian-orders-to-plot-infrastructure-attack/	2024-12-04T15:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187193404.jpg
Blinken confirms Ukraine to receive $50 billion transfer from frozen Russian assets	Ukraine is set to receive $50 billion in frozen Russian assets held by the United States and the European Union, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Dec. 4. Blinken confirmed during a briefing that the transfer is part of a coordinated effort between the U.S. and EU to support Ukraine. &quot;...Making sure that (Ukraine) has the money, the resources it needs to sustain its economy and to sustain its defense &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve now managed on the basis of the frozen sovereign assets, the Russian assets that are frozen, to get $50 billion to Ukraine that will be going out the door in the next &#x2013; in the coming weeks, both from the United States and Europe,&quot; Blinken said. The funds, frozen in response to Russia&apos;s invasion, will provide crucial economic and defense assistance to Ukraine in the coming months. Blinken noted that the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine since 2022, while the allies and partners contributed $158 billion. On Dec. 2, Blinken announced that the U.S. will deliver a $725 million weapons package to Ukraine. The move comes as President Joe Biden&apos;s administration, nearing the end of its term, works to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s defenses against Russian forces before the January transition of power. The package will include Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, drones, and landmines, among other equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-confirms-ukraine-to-receive-50-billion-transfer-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-12-04T13:58:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
US enforces visa restrictions on Russian officials linked to Ukrainian child deportations	The U.S. State Department has imposed visa restrictions on five Russian officials for their role in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. &quot;Many of these children have had their identities changed and origins obscured, have been subjected to pro-Russia indoctrination and militarization, or have been adopted by Russian families,&quot; U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Dec. 4. &quot;We will continue to promote accountability for perpetrators and support efforts to return Ukraine&#x2019;s children,&quot; he added. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database &quot;Children of War.&quot; Less than 400 have been returned to Ukraine. A Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3 details Russia&apos;s systematic program of deporting and forcibly assimilating Ukrainian children. Under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, children were transported via military aircraft in 2022, reclassified in Russian databases as native-born, and subjected to pro-Russian re-education before being adopted into Russian families. Ukrainian children had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia. The report identifies 314 children taken from occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions, with over 60 granted Russian citizenship. Psychologists have been used to legitimize the program, falsely framing adoptions as medically necessary. These findings, linking Putin and Children&apos;s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova directly to the program, will be submitted to the International Criminal Court as evidence of war crimes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-enforces-visa-restrictions-on-russian-officials-linked-to-ukrainian-child-deportations/	2024-12-04T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182199374.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's new Palianytsia missile-drone enters serial production, minister says	Key developments on Dec. 4: Ukraine&#x2019;s recently developed Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, has entered serial production, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in an op-ed on Dec. 4. &quot;A new start-up implemented the Palianytsia missile project, which has already entered serial production thanks to the support of the Defense Ministry,&quot; Umerov wrote in the op-ed, published by the Lb.ua outlet. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners only recently allowed strikes in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast with foreign-made missiles but prohibited attacks deeper in the rear. One of these domestic-made weapons is the missile-drone hybrid named Palianytsia, which combines existing technologies to effectively strike deep into Russian territory. &quot;The use of foreign missiles often requires coordination with partners&#x2026; Ukrainian cruise and ballistic missiles will allow our Armed Forces to act independently, delivering pinpoint strikes on key enemy targets,&quot; Umerov wrote. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in November that Ukraine has produced its first 100 missiles. According to Umerov, Ukraine also resumed and scaled up serial production of Neptune cruise missiles, modifying them to have a greater range. Germany does not rule out deploying troops to Ukraine to ensure a ceasefire, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said during a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. Baerbock told journalists that in order to achieve long term peace in Ukraine, security guarantees such as Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership and deployment of international troops, including German ones, are conceivable. The comments follow media reports about the U.K. and France also discussing sending its soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine. European troops overseeing a peaceful post-war situation in the country were reportedly included in a peace plan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team. Baerbock, a member of Germany&#x2019;s Green party, has represented a more pro-Ukrainian voice in the governing coalition with Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who adopted a more cautious approach on certain issues. Earlier this year, the chancellor rejected a proposal by French President Emmanuel Macron to send military trainers to Ukraine. Russian troops are storming the Kherson direction in an attempt to gain a foothold on some islands in the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Suspilne on Dec. 4. Russian forces are trying to conduct attacks near the Kozatskyi and Kruhlyk islands, Voloshyn said. His comments came after Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin told the Financial Times that Russia &quot;wants to launch another offensive&quot; in the direction of Kherson. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, and Russian troops were pushed to the river&apos;s east bank. Russia has assembled &quot;300 boats to cross the river&quot; Prokudin said in an article published earlier on Dec. 4. &quot;Their goal is to capture a certain foothold, hold it and bring as much of our forces and means as possible,&quot; he said. Russia is now training its forcing assault groups in occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, the spokesperson said, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence data. According to Voloshyn, Moscow&apos;s troops are practicing how to cross water obstacles and transfer landing groups. &quot;There has not been a single successful attempt at this assault or enemy crossing in a month. The Ukrainian Defense Forces are now reliably defending the city of Kherson and Kherson Oblast, and the entire right bank,&quot; Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Yevhenii Matvieiev, the mayor of the occupied Dniprorudne town, was tortured to death in Russian captivity, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said on his Telegram channel on Dec. 4. &quot;People are the most valuable thing we are losing in this merciless war waged by the terrorist country of Russia,&quot; the governor said. Russian forces occupied the southeastern town of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast during the early days of the war, taking the mayor to captivity and submitting him to torture, Fedorov said. Matvieiev spent two years and eight months in captivity before dying. His body was returned to Ukraine during the latest exchange. &quot;Yevhenii was a true patriot, not indifferent to the fate of his country and his community. He always worked with people and for people, listened, and helped everyone who needed it,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;During the occupation, he did not leave the town or the people, did everything to ensure the (continuation of the) life of the community, constantly informed the population about the course of events and supported them.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-49/	2024-12-04T11:59:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Ukrainian businesses increasingly look beyond diesel for backup power as blackouts begin again	As Ukraine begins yet another winter with rolling blackouts and freezing temperatures, businesses are increasingly looking beyond diesel generators to fuel their operations during power cuts, business leaders said at the Energy Security Dialogue 2024 on Dec. 4. Speaking at the conference in Kyiv, CEO of Nova Energy Andrii Lytvynenko said the company is moving away from diesel generators and plans to equip around a thousand branches of the popular Nova Poshta postal chain with battery power supplies that allow for uninterrupted electricity during outages. Around 400 branches already use these systems, he said. Nova Energy is part of Nova Group, which owns Nova Poshta, Ukraine&apos;s leading postal service that transports around 2 million packages a day. &quot;The simplest, fastest solution is, of course, generators,&quot; Lytvynenko said. &#xA0;&quot;Today, we have around 4,000 generators in the company.&quot; However, the noise and carbon emissions &#x2014; as well as the work needed to refuel and maintain them &#x2014; led the company to look for alternative emergency power systems, Lytvynenko said. Additionally, the company is investing in solar power and gas-piston plants that generate both electricity and heat. &quot;If we take energy independence, we have already invested more than 13 million dollars in this infrastructure, and we plan to invest in it further,&quot; Lytvynenko said. A survey conducted this summer of more than 100 companies by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine (AmCham) found that 87% of companies were ready for the winter blackouts. &quot;Nevertheless around 40% of companies that said that they have or are building plans and include other sources&quot; alongside diesel generators, said Olena Boichenko, a partner at Deloitte in Ukraine, who worked with AmCham to conduct the survey. &quot;Ukraine now has such unique situations &#x2014; of course, unfortunately, negatively unique &#x2014; &#xA0;but there are also opportunities, to be such a testing ground of different sources and different strategies,&quot; Boichenko said. Oleksandr Dombrovsky, deputy chairman of the board of MHP and president of MHP Eco Energy, said the agro-company is also focused on innovative energy technologies. Although the company was focused on renewable energy technologies before the full-scale invasion, the war has given it new urgency to innovate. MHP, one of the largest agro-companies in Europe, employs more than 30,000 workers and exports its products to dozens of countries. Since 2018, MHP Eco Energy has been an operator for the sale of electricity to the enterprises of MHP group. &quot;We started our path to energy independence, to energy security almost 10 years ago,&quot; Dombrovsky said. &quot;This has led us to start attracting and investing in green technologies.&quot; The company has more than ten solar-generation projects in the works, and estimates that the company has the potential for about 800 megawatts of solar generation. &quot;This year we installed 15 megawatts of solar generation on the roofs of poultry houses,&quot; Dombrovsky said. &quot;In addition, we have now completed the installation of almost 20 megawatts of cogeneration systems (producing energy and heat) that will operate in these conditions of war on natural gas, but in the future they will also be switched to biogas, projects with which we are working to this day,&quot; Dombrovsky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-businesses-increasingly-look-beyond-diesel-for-power-as-blackouts-begin-again/	2024-12-04T11:18:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2141955745.jpg
Ukraine preparing sanctions against Georgian government amid crackdown on pro-EU protests	President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked Ukrainian officials to prepare sanctions against the Georgian government amid a crackdown against pro-EU protests in the country, he said in an evening address on Dec. 4. &quot;We are developing our legal response and working with European and other partners on concrete actions,&quot; Zelensky said. The latest wave of protests against the ruling Georgian Dream party broke out last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the suspension of the South Caucasus&apos; EU accession process until at least 2028. Over 220 people have been arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons. Ukraine previously condemned the violent crackdown by Georgian authorities against protesters. According to Zelensky, the Georgian authorities &quot;are pushing the country into clear dependence on Russia.&quot; &quot;It is truly shameful what actions they are taking against their own people,&quot; the president said. &quot;And when Moscow praises these authorities in Georgia, it clearly shows for whom they are now working in Tbilisi and for whom they are dispersing the protests. Definitely not for Georgia.&quot; Washington suspended the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership days after violence against pro-EU protesters, while the number of countries have slapped sanctions against Georgian officials. Tbilisi&apos;s ties with the U.S. and other Western countries have steadily deteriorated since the pro-Russian Georgian Dream adopted a controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law in May. Tensions only mounted after Georgian Dream declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections, despite widespread accusations of a rigged vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-preparing-sanctions-against-georgian-government-amid-crackdown-on-pro-eu-protetst/	2024-12-04T11:01:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg
House Speaker rejects Biden's request for additional $24 billion in Ukraine aid	U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Dec. 4 that he will not put to a vote a request for an additional $24 billion in aid to Ukraine following reports that President Joe Biden was quietly asking Congress to green light further assistance to Kyiv before he leaves office. Roughly $16 billion of the sum could be used to restock U.S. arsenals, while the remaining $8 billion would go to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), Politico reported. When asked if he would add aid for Ukraine to a continuing resolution to fund the government, Johnson rejected such a move. &quot;I&#x2019;m not planning to do that,&quot; he said during a press briefing. According to Johnson, Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election will &quot;change the dynamics&quot; of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;It is not the place of Joe Biden to make that decision now, we have a newly elected president, and we are going to wait and take the new commander in chief&#x2019;s direction on all that, so I don&#x2019;t expect any Ukraine funding to come up now,&quot; he added. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, contributed to a delay in aid to Kyiv last fall by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill, but eventually reached a deal to pass the bill. The Biden administration is trying to ship in as much aid to Ukraine as possible before Trump, who has criticized military support for Kyiv, takes office in January. Trump has consistently said he would seek to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. While the details of his plan remain unclear, some reports indicate it might entail Ukraine ceding territory and at least temporarily foregoing its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/house-speaker-rejects-bidens-request-for-additional-24-billion-in-ukraine-aid/	2024-12-04T10:26:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1843406232.jpg
Russian drone strikes on Ukraine are surging — how bad can it get?	For the third month in a row, the number of Shahed-type kamikaze drones launched by Russia at Ukraine surged to record levels. According to figures from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, Moscow deployed a total of 2,576 drones during November, up from 2,023 the month before. And the Kremlin clearly doesn&apos;t intend to let up on the relentless nightly assaults &#x2014; speaking in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is planning to increase drone production &quot;almost ten times&quot; this year. In 2023, the Russian army received about 140,000 drones of different types, according to Putin. This year, Putin said, Moscow wants to produce 1.4 million. This begs the question: How bad could it get for Ukraine? A chart showing how Russian drone strkes against Ukraine have surged in 2024 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Ukraine&apos;s air defenses, bolstered by Western-supplied systems such as Patriot and NASAMS, have become highly effective at defending cities from Russian mass missile attacks. But due to the high price of missiles for such systems, which makes using them against relatively cheap drones highly inefficient, Ukraine developed, and relied on different methods to combat them. &quot;They have established an approach using mobile fire groups and a huge network of sensors of different types to detect and track these drones,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They are using anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, even cheaper rockets, and these kinds of interception techniques are much more cost-efficient compared to Patriot and other types of air defenses.&quot; Ukraine has also become more adept at using electronic warfare (EW) techniques to confuse and steer Russian drones in the wrong direction during attacks. GPS spoofing involves manipulating or deceiving a drone&apos;s GPS receiver by transmitting fake signals, tricking it into thinking it&apos;s in the wrong location and heading elsewhere. Using both mobile fire groups and EW, Borsari says that only around 5% of the drones launched by Russia actually make it through Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. But he adds that just as Ukraine has adapted to defending against drone attacks, Russia is also adapting in turn. When Russia first began deploying kamikaze drones to attack Ukraine in September 2022, Moscow used the imported Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones. Since then, Russia has begun manufacturing its own Shahed-type drones and developing new variations.

The most significant, in terms of the size of attacks, is the number of decoy drones being employed by Russia. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Nov. 18 that Russian forces are using cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense system. These are reported to be a variation of the Gerbera drone. Made from materials such as plywood and foam, they are reportedly ten times cheaper than Iran&apos;s Shahed drone. While some versions carry explosives or reconnaissance equipment, some are equipped with neither and are launched alongside their deadly counterparts in order to distract Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. &quot;Sometimes they&apos;re decoys, sometimes they&apos;re not &#x2014; it&apos;s all meant to create more problems for Ukrainian air defenses and to waste a lot of resources in tracking, detecting, and engaging,&quot; Borsari said. According to an investigation by the Associated Press (AP) on Nov.16, Russia has recently begun equipping some drones with thermobaric warheads, normally associated with missiles. Thermobaric warheads create an intense wave of high pressure and heat that can lead to devastating injuries, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage. While controversial, thermobaric munitions are not prohibited under international law. After a recent attack on the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 22, Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said the drones used in the strike were equipped with shrapnel munitions. In addition to the explosive power of the warhead, they blasted out ball bearings from the impact area. Two people were killed in the attack, and 12 others were injured. &quot;These weapons are used to kill people. Not to destroy structures, just to kill more people,&quot; Artiukh said in a video uploaded to the regional government&apos;s official Telegram channel.

Russia&apos;s main Shahed-type drone production plant is believed to be located in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the central Republic of Tatarstan. Originally, it was intended to manufacture 6,000 drones a year, but a report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in May said it was way ahead of schedule and had produced 4,500 by the end of April. Ukraine has targeted the plant, successfully hitting it with a long-range drone strike at the beginning of April, but Bruchmann said that given the increase in drone attacks in recent months, it didn&apos;t significantly disrupt operations. &quot;I guess what we&apos;re seeing now means that the factory is running again,&quot; he said. According to Borsari, this likely means &quot;we will see potentially even higher numbers per day of drones launched against Ukraine in the coming weeks,&quot; though he adds it isn&apos;t certain that Russia can obtain enough components to keep up with demand in the longer term. Russian President Vladimir Putin observes an exhibition of Orlan-10 UAV drones at the Special Technology Center on September 19, 2024 in Saint Petersburg (Contributor/Getty Images)Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for tougher sanctions against the providers of components used in Russian drones. Russia continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies. Russia is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea. &quot;Microchips, microcontrollers, processors, and many other parts are essential for enabling this terror,&quot; Zelensky said. Borsari said that by managing to circumvent current sanctions, Russia will be able to &quot;keep a steady supply of components, not without difficulties, of course.&quot; &quot;I expect (the number of drones being used in attacks) to remain at this level, if not, go up in the coming weeks,&quot; he added. But Bruchmann said it was too early to tell if any further rise in numbers is a long-term trend, adding there&apos;s the possibility that Russia is deploying stockpiles ahead of Donald Trump entering the White House in January. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t panic just yet,&quot; he said, adding the increase in numbers could be laying the ground for any negotiations led by the U.S. between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;Putin is basically telling (the U.S.) &apos;I can escalate too, and this is not going to be as easy.&apos; &quot;So it&apos;s too early to tell if this is a longer-term trend.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strikes-on-ukraine-are-surging-how-bad-can-it-get/	2024-12-04T09:53:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187307960.jpg
Ukrainian drone hits special police regiment building in Chechnya, Kadyrov claims	A drone attack hit a special police regiment building in the center of the city of Grozny in the Chechen Republic on Dec. 4, Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov claimed, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. According to Kadyrov, a Ukrainian drone struck the roof of the regiment named after Akhmat Kadyrov, the first Russian-backed head of Chechnya. The Chechen strongman claimed that people suffered as a result of the attack without providing further details. Ramzan Kadyrov&apos;s claims followed media reports about an attack on the Chechen Republic. The independent Russian news outlet IStories reported that a drone hit the regiment&apos;s barracks in a building where 27 Chechens had been reportedly executed in 2017. Kyiv has not commented on these claims, which cannot be verified independently. In late October, the first drone strike against Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic targeted the Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29 that the drone strike was possibly launched from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia and may have been connected to a feud between Kadyrov and officials from the two regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-hits-special-police-regiment-in-chechnya-kadyrov-claims/	2024-12-04T09:22:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151325824.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 156	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 156 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Nov. 25 &#x2013; Dec. 1, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. The Cabinet approves the state ownership policy, a key document for SOEs&#x2019; corporate governance. On Nov. 29, the Economy Ministry reported that the Cabinet of Ministers approved the state ownership policy designed to enhance state asset management. The state ownership policy was not publicly available at the time of writing. The document is pivotal for implementing the provisions of Law No. 3587-IX, which enhances SOE governance taking into account OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. The Economy Ministry has been developing the policy over the past nine months since the law was enacted, the ministry said. Three and half years ago (Issue 36), we reported that the Verkhovna Rada approved Draft Law No. 5593-d in the first reading on July 15, 2021. The draft law was aimed at aligning the SOE corporate governance framework with the OECD SOE Guidelines. On Feb. 22, the Verkhovna Rada passed the second reading of that draft law (see our Issue 120.) On March 5, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the law into Law No. 3587-IX (see Issue 122). For detail on the improved legal framework for SOEs introduced by the law, see Issues 120 and 122. Yuliia Svyrydenko, first deputy prime minister and economy minister, said that the state ownership policy defines the role of the state in managing SOEs, specifies which companies are strategic for the country and what tasks they should perform, and introduces advanced corporate governance standards in the state-owned sector. &#x201C;Alongside this document, for the first time in Ukraine, a clear and transparent remuneration policy for &#x421;EOs and supervisory board members of SOEs, as well as a dividend policy, are being introduced,&#x201D; Svyrydenko added. According to the Economy Ministry, the state ownership policy provides for: The adoption of the state property policy is one of the indicators under the Ukraine Facility and a structural benchmark under the IMF Memorandum. The next steps will be to do a triage, that is, to sort SOEs into those that would remain state-owned, privatized, or liquidated; form supervisory boards at SOEs where this is mandatory; and delineate SOEs&#x2019; &#x201C;special obligations,&quot; the ministry added. The Cabinet approved four new independent members of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board, the company&#x2019;s press office reported on Nov. 27. The candidate search was done by Korn Ferry, a global executive search firm. The candidate profiles aimed at competencies required to address the company&#x2019;s current challenges and implement its strategy, Ukrenergo also explained. The four new independent members of the supervisory board are: As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. According to the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement between Ukraine and the IMF, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo must be re-established by end-December 2024. This is a conditionality for Ukraine&#x2019;s access to about $1.1 billion under the IMF program. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member would be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure. The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; was scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. There has been no news yet on the selection or appointment of the state representatives. The first and primary task of the new supervisory board will be to conduct a transparent competitive CEO selection, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The law retroactively increasing the 2024 income tax for banks to 50% comes into effect. On Nov. 28, President Zelensky signed Draft Law No. 11416-d increasing taxes to finance the state budget. The law was published on Nov. 30 and became effective on Dec. 1. As we wrote in Issue 149, the Verkhovna Rada &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s Parliament &#x2014; passed Draft Law No. 11416-d on Oct. 10, including a provision to increase the income tax for banks from 25% to 50% in 2024. This is not the first time the Rada has raised banks&#x2019; income taxes to 50% retroactively. In 2023, parliament also passed a law introducing a windfall income tax of 50%, applied for 2023. Prior to this, the income tax rate was 18%, and from Jan. 1, 2024, it was set at 25%. See Issue 113 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 155, Ukrainian banks posted cumulative net profits of Hr 117.63 billion (around $2 billion) in January-September 2024. With the new law now in effect, Ukrainian banks will pay Hr 58.82 billion (around $1.3 billion) in income taxes for this period alone. Ukrainian energy infrastructure struck again. On Nov. 28, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko reported that Russia had launched another massive missile and drone attack on energy facilities all over Ukraine. This was the second massive attack in November and eleventh since the beginning of the year, the Energy Ministry added. Russia&#x2019;s attack came during the night and morning of Nov. 28 and was characterized by the use of combined weapons, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. Russia launched 188 aerial weapons, with Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense downing 79 missiles and 35 drones. Later, Ukrenergo confirmed damage to energy facilities in several oblasts. Due to the attacks, the company was forced to introduce emergency power outages in several regions. The outages were cancelled later that day, but Ukrenergo was forced to tighten its hourly outage schedules the following days. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukraine nuclear power plants (NPPs) were forced to lower their power levels as a precautionary step for a second time in less than two weeks. In addition, one reactor at Rivne NPP was disconnected from the grid. From March 22 to Nov. 17, Ukraine faced eight massive missile and drone strikes on electricity facilities.&#x202F;See our Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 134, 145, and 154 for more detail. After every Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks. Naftogaz Group also reported that Russia attacked its facilities. No one was injured, and the attack would not affect the provision of services to Ukrainian customers, the company said. See our Issues 125, 127, 129, and 131 on previous Russian attacks on underground gas storages. Krippa receives final approval for the purchase of Hotel Ukraina. On Nov. 28, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) announced that it had granted Ola Fine LLC, the winner of the privatization auction, approval to acquire control over the hotel. Per the sale and purchase agreement, the ownership rights over the asset are transferred to the new owner after the AMCU&#x2019;s clearance. At the same time, the 1.51-hectare land plot, on which the hotel is located, is not subject to sale and purchase, liga.net added. As we wrote in Issue 148, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Hotel Ukraina l for Hr 2.5 billion ($59 million) on Sept. 18. According to the SPFU, the hotel has 363 rooms, six conference halls, meeting rooms, a shelter with a separate auditorium for events seating 50 people, and a parking lot for 80 cars. Ola Fine LLC is owned by businessman Maksym Krippa. As we reported in Issue 148, Krippa, a businessman who avoids publicity, became famous in 2022 when Forbes Ukraine wrote that he had acquired a major Ukrainian e-sports brand, the NAVI team. Later, the businessman&#x2019;s representatives confirmed that the deal was concluded back in 2018. Krippa also owns Maincast e-sports broadcasting studio. In 2023, he acquired GSC Game World, a company that developed the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. cyber game. Krippa had also bought the Brovary Wholesale Market back in 2009. Krippa has recently started buying up significant real estate properties in Kyiv. He purchased Dnipro Hotel in Kyiv, located near Ukraine Hotel, in 2020, and the Parus Business Centre, previously owned by businessman and former MP Vadym Stolar, in 2023. See more on Krippa in Issue 148. As we wrote in Issue 154, Ola Fine LLC had fully paid Hr 2.5 billion ($59 million) for the hotel itself and Hr 502 million ($12 million) in VAT.

Could Ukraine build a nuclear bomb? We asked an expert	Dec. 5 marks the 30-year anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum - a political agreement providing Ukraine with security assurances in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear weapons following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s reporter Oleg Sukhov sat down with Robert Kelley, an engineer with over 35 years of experience in the U.S. Department of Energy&#x2019;s nuclear weapons complex, to discuss whether the weapon Ukraine gave up would be of much use now and if the country still has the capacity to produce a nuclear device.	https://kyivindependent.com/could-ukraine-build-a-nuclear-bomb-we-asked-an-expert/	2024-12-04T08:29:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Robert-Kelley--2-.jpg
Ukraine has 'hard decisions' to make about further mobilization, Blinken says	Ukraine has &quot;hard decisions&quot; to make about further mobilization to fight Russia&apos;s full-scale war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 4. &quot;These are necessary decisions,&quot; Blinken said. His remarks are among the latest from top U.S. officials amid reports that Western partners are pressuring Ukraine to lower its minimum mobilization age from 25 to 18 in an effort to replenish military ranks. Blinken described mobilization as &quot;critical&quot; for Ukraine, adding that despite having funds and ammunition, people are needed to repel Russian aggression. &quot;For every person, every soldier that Ukraine mobilizes, we are committed to making sure that they have the training and the equipment they need to effectively defend the country,&quot; the U.S. Secretary of State said. President Volodymyr Zelensky has refuted Washington&apos;s appeals. According to the president, partners have only provided enough aid to fully equip 2.5 out of the 10 Ukrainian brigades that Ukraine had requested support for. &quot;How do you want me just to mobilize young guys, (as) they don&apos;t know where to go &#x2013; in which brigade, with which weapon they will fight?&quot; the president said in early December. Kyiv said that Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization strategy is regularly discussed with allies but dismissed suggestions of tension over the issue. Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April, the mobilization draft slowed down in autumn, leaving many front-line units undermanned in the face of more numerous Russian troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-hard-decisions-to-make-about-further-mobilization-blinken-says/	2024-12-04T08:18:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188033099.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Historic tax increase signed 44 days late	The following is the Dec. 3, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. President Volodymyr Zelensky finally signed into law a bill authorizing Ukraine&#x2019;s first wartime tax increase on Nov. 28, following more than a month of delay. What&#x2019;s changing? The government is raising the war tax on personal income from 1.5% to 5% and introducing a war tax on small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, or FOPs as they&#x2019;re known here in Ukraine. It&#x2019;s also planning to tax bank profits at 50% and raise taxes on other financial institutions to 25%, among other hikes. The changes will come into effect starting Dec. 1. The tax increases will help raise additional funds for December 2024 and should provide around Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) in additional revenues in 2025, which will be crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense against Russia. The hike was also a demand of the International Monetary Fund as part of its $15 billion loan program to Ukraine. Why the hold-up? It&#x2019;s not exactly clear why the president took 44 days to put pen to paper after the parliament passed the law on Oct. 10. Questions also remain as to why, if there was no rush, proposed changes to the draft law weren&apos;t made &#x2013; as well as to why the president took so much time to sign the version of the law that he himself backed. In response to the above questions, opposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak had this to say: &#x201C;The answer is I don&apos;t know. Nobody knows. Simple and without logic.&#x201D; One explanation as to why Zelensky took so long &#x2014; he simply didn&#x2019;t want to do something unpopular. The business community was particularly irate about the tax increase, which felt it disproportionately targeted taxpayers instead of shadow markets. &quot;People often procrastinate when they have to do something they don&apos;t want to do. The president is also human,&quot; one unnamed source in the government told Ekonomichna Pravda. According to the media outlet&#x2019;s sources, Zelensky felt the government didn&#x2019;t do a sufficient job of communicating why Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort and economic needs required increasing taxes. Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: Delaying signing the law cost the budget &#x2014; and the country&#x2019;s defense &#x2014; Hr 270 million ($6.4 million) a day, or Hr 12 billion ($287 million) for the entire 44 days, according to Zhelezniak. With only the month of December, the new law will only bring Hr 8 billion ($191 million) to the budget this year.

(Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Gazprom planning for end of transitGazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled gas company, is planning for a scenario in which no natural gas will flow to Europe through Ukraine after Dec. 31, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. Kyiv has indicated it will not extend the transit deal, ending over 50 years of gas flows from Siberia to central Europe &#x2014; a vital revenue stream for Russia since the Soviet era. Gazprom&#x2019;s internal planning assumes no Ukrainian transit next year, the source said, adding that the company expects Russian gas exports to Europe and Turkey &#x2014; termed &quot;far abroad&quot; &#x2014; to decline by 20% in 2025. Due to the loss of the Ukrainian route, exports are projected to drop to just under 39 billion cubic meters (bcm) from the more than 49 bcm expected this year. Meanwhile, talks between European energy companies, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan have reportedly been ongoing to replace the flow of gas through Ukraine&#x2019;s pipelines with Azeri gas after Dec. 31. In an interview with the Financial Times, outgoing EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson warned against the deal, saying that the &#x201C;swap&#x201D; would end in Russian flows continuing but as &#x201C;pre-labeled&#x201D; Azeri gas.

(Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Naftogaz chief shuffledUkraine&apos;s parliament on Dec. 3 voted to support the candidacy of state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz CEO Oleksii Chernyshov to serve as &quot;minister for national unity.&#x201D; The new minister&apos;s powers remain unclear. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently presented the department as part of Ukraine&apos;s &#x201C;resilience plan,&#x201D; saying it would focus on strengthening relations with Ukrainians living abroad. Later in the day, the government renamed the Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories to the Ministry of National Unity of Ukraine.&quot;This institutional strengthening will help to create a new quality of work and interaction with the multimillion Ukrainian community from all waves of migration,&quot; Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Even before the full-scale invasion, there were millions of Ukrainians living around the world in various diaspora communities. The war has pushed millions more from their homes, with an estimated 6.7 million living abroad as of August 2024. Chernyshov has been the CEO of the Naftogaz Group since 2022. Before that, he served as Kyiv Oblast governor. His replacement as Naftogaz chief is yet to be announced. &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,&#x201D; released on Nov. 20, is set in a fictionalized exclusion zone of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. (GSC Game World)S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2The long-awaited release of &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl&#x201D; has been one of the biggest gaming events of the year &#x2014; and Ukrainian soldiers all along the front lines have joined in the frenzy as well. The game, developed by the Ukrainian company GSC Game World, quickly shot up to the top spot of global video game sales, with players of the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter game roaming a fictionalized Chornobyl exclusion zone with a weapon in their hand. The excitement has been palpable in Ukraine, where the game&#x2019;s release was marked by congratulatory remarks in parliament, viral cross-promotion campaigns, and memes implying that the U.S. embassy&#x2019;s closure that day due to a security threat was really so its employees could download &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.&#x201D; Our reporter Andrea Januta spoke to several soldiers who have been playing the game since its release. &#x201C;In these games, I do everything the same as in life, but without the fear of dying. It helps me accept traumatic experiences and realize that this is the past, and it needs to be let go,&#x201D; one soldier told Januta. Read the full article here. Ukraine&#x2019;s new &#x201C;eSupport program&#x201D; that will dole out Hr 1,000 ($24) to every Ukrainian citizen through online registration received over 2.1 million applications on its first day of operation, including nearly half a million for children, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 1. The cash can be used for utilities, medicine, books, transportation, and education, or donated to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces through volunteer funds. The populist move by Zelensky has received criticism at a time when the country is struggling to fund its defense. More on that here. At least 15 of Ukraine&apos;s 20 civilian airports have sustained damage since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 30. The statement comes as Ukraine is reportedly looking to open either the western Lviv or Kyiv airport in early 2025, but according to Shmyhal, &#x201C;security issues and the military situation remain key to this decision.&#x201D; Shmyhal added that the country has &#x201C;conducted a risk assessment and determined the needs of the air defense forces to partially open the airspace.&#x201D; Ukraine received $100 million as part of a loan from South Korea for budget assistance, the first time the country is providing aid to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 29. According to Shmyhal, the funds will be devoted to Ukraine&apos;s social sector by supporting budget expenses. In April of this year, Kyiv and Seoul signed an agreement enabling Ukraine to attract up to $2.1 billion in concessional loans over 2024-2029. The loan has a term of 20 years with an annual interest rate of 1% and a five-year grace period. Ukraine has received a $4.8 billion loan from the World Bank through the PEACE project for social expenditures, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 27. &quot;We are very grateful to the United States and the development partners who are financing assistance under the PEACE project,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. The Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance Project (PEACE) helps to provide funding for pensions, support for internally displaced persons (IDP), and salaries for teachers, first responders, and other state employees. In the first nine months of 2024, IT exports out of Ukraine dropped 4.9% compared to the same period in 2023, according to Central Bank data released last week. Before the full-scale invasion, the IT industry had one of the largest shares of Ukrainian exports. Now, bans on working with Ukraine, as well as Russia and Belarus, to reduce risks brought on by the war and sanctions, travel bans on male Ukrainian IT workers that don&#x2019;t give them face time with clients abroad, and the threat that Ukrainian workers could be mobilized, are all contributing to a decrease. It&#x2019;s not all Ukraine-related &#x2014; economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and changes in the global IT industry are also to blame.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-historic-tax-increase-signed-44-days-late/	2024-12-04T07:47:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/volodymyr_zelenskiy_32.jpg
Russia gathers 300 boats to cross Dnipro River amid attempted attacks in Kherson Oblast, military says	Russian troops are storming the Kherson direction in an attempt to gain a foothold on some islands in the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Suspilne on Dec. 4. Russian forces are trying to conduct attacks near the Kozatskyi and Kruhlyk islands, Voloshyn said. His comments came after Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin told the Financial Times that Russia &quot;wants to launch another offensive&quot; in the direction of Kherson. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, and Russian troops were pushed to the river&apos;s east bank. Russia has assembled &quot;300 boats to cross the river&quot; Prokudin said in an article published earlier on Dec. 4. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Kherson Oblast as of Dec. 3, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Voloshyn confirmed this claim, adding that Moscow&apos;s attack attempts have failed and resulted in losses. &quot;Their goal is to capture a certain foothold, hold it and bring as much of our forces and means as possible,&quot; he said. Russia is now training its forcing assault groups in occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, the spokesperson said, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence data. According to Voloshyn, Moscow&apos;s troops are practicing how to cross water obstacles and transfer landing groups. &quot;There has not been a single successful attempt at this assault or enemy crossing in a month. The Ukrainian Defense Forces are now reliably defending the city of Kherson and Kherson Oblast, and the entire right bank,&quot; Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Ukraine has also been building heavy fortifications near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-gathers-300-boats-to-cross-dnipro-river-amid-attempted-attacks-in-kherson-oblast-officials-say/	2024-12-04T07:42:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1767736364.jpg
Ukraine’s gas transit operator prepared for Russian attacks after transit deal expires, operator says	With a deal to transport Russian gas through Ukraine set to expire at the end of the year, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas transit network could soon come under Russian attacks, warned Dmytro Lyppa, CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, though the probability that gas transport is halted is &#x201C;very low,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We believe the risks of attacks on our facilities are significantly increasing with the suspension of transit,&#x201D; said Lyppa on Dec. 4, speaking at the Energy Security Dialogue 2024 in Kyiv. &#x201C;We are taking all measures to ensure the security of our facilities.&#x201D; However, it is unlikely that the crisis Ukraine is experiencing in its energy sector due to large-scale attacks by Russia will be replicated in the gas sector, he added. &#x201C;We believe that the system is able to withstand quite significant loads in case of of certain events,&#x201D; said Lyppa. &#x201C;Let me remind you that a system was built for almost 150 billion cubic meters per year for transportation. We are currently still transporting 14-15, let&apos;s say,&#x201D; said Lyppa. &#x201C;Let&apos;s put it this way: In order to stop this (flow), it would be a really apocalyptic scenario, but its probability is very low.&#x201D; Russia has continued to sell gas to Europe by transporting it via Ukraine&#x2019;s network of gas pipelines under a 2019 agreement. The deal is set to expire at the end of the year, and Ukraine has repeatedly said it will not extend the deal. The full-scale Russian invasion marked a turning point, forcing an unprecedented shift in Europe&#x2019;s energy policy to reduce their dependence on Russia. With European countries taking steps to diversify their energy sources, the Russia&#x2019;s share of gas among EU natural gas imports dropped from 45% in 2021 to 15% last year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gas-transit-operator-is-prepared-for-likely-russian-attacks-after-gas-transit-deal-expires-operator-says/	2024-12-04T07:23:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-821523200.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 3	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 3 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Nov. 24-Dec. 1, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. International partners are asked to submit candidates to the commission that shall select a new state customs head. According to our information, the Foreign Ministry on Nov. 29 sent official letters to embassies, international organizations and other relevant international partners asking them to submit their candidates to a commission that will competitively select the state customs head. The ministry requested that all candidates be submitted by the end of the year. Under the current memorandum of understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the deadline for appointing a new head of the State Customs Service (SCS) is June 30. The new procedure for selecting the head involves a selection commission, consisting of three representatives from the Finance Ministry and three representatives from international partners. The president signs draft law on tax hike. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed draft law #11416-d, which amends the tax code and increases taxes. The bill came into force on Dec. 1. The government expects it to generate an additional Hr 8 billion ($191 million) in budget revenue in 2024, which is less than what was originally planned. In 2025, the bill is projected to draw an additional Hr 141 billion (around $3.4 billion) of revenue for the state. These expected revenues have already been factored into next year&#x2019;s state budget, which has also been signed and will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. Cabinet appoints new independent members of Ukrenergo supervisory board. On Nov. 27, the Cabinet of Ministers approved four new independent members for the supervisory board of Ukrenergo, the nation&#x2019;s state-owned power transmission system operator. This is a structural benchmark under the IMF memorandum that Ukraine must meet by the end of the year. The new members of Ukrenergo&apos;s supervisory board are: Cabinet approves state ownership policy. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has approved a state ownership policy that defines the role of the state in managing state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This step fulfills another requirement under Ukraine&#x2019;s financial assistance programs with the IMF and the European Union (Ukraine Facility). According to Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, the state ownership policy provides clear guidelines for optimizing the portfolio of state assets. It also ensures the continued implementation of OECD standards of corporate governance, particularly in establishing supervisory boards, implementing transparent remuneration policies for SOE managers and board members, and adopting a dividend policy, among other provisions. Experts warn that several draft laws submitted to the parliament jeopardize Ukraine&apos;s international commitments. Next week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament is set to consider draft law #12206-2, which seeks to establish the High Administrative Court as required by Ukraine&apos;s Memorandum with the IMF. However, anti-corruption experts have raised concerns that of the 21 individuals tasked with selecting judges for this court, only three will be international experts. The Committee on Legal Policy has already approved the draft law for its first reading. Additionally, by the end of December 2024, Ukraine must amend the Criminal Procedural Code to address the consequences of exceeding time limits for pre-trial investigations. While provisions to meet this requirement under the IMF Memorandum have been submitted as amendments to draft law #11265, experts from the Ukrainian NGO Anti-Corruption Action Center, argue that the proposed law falls short. It does not eliminate the mandatory closure of criminal proceedings when pre-trial investigation time limits expire. Furthermore, it fails to grant the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office the authority to handle extradition and mutual legal assistance requests, a key structural benchmark under the IMF agreement. Cabinet appoints new members to the ESBU Civil Oversight Council. The Cabinet of Ministers approved new members for the Civil Oversight Council of the Bureau of Economic Security. The council will oversee the work of the bureau and delegate representatives to its disciplinary commissions. Its members were selected through an open online competition and represent five well-known non-governmental organizations. Tax committee approves a draft law for OECD membership. The Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy of the Verkhovna Rada approved for the final reading draft law #10319 on tax measures to combat bribery of foreign officials in international business relations. The adoption of the draft law is a requirement of the roadmap for Ukraine&#x2019;s membership to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The bill must be passed in December before moving forward with the next stage of negotiations. Tax committee recommends increasing excise tax on tobacco products. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy has recommended the adoption of draft law #11090 in its final reading. This bill proposes a gradual increase in excise tax rates on tobacco products, bringing them in line with the minimum levels set by EU Directive 2011/64/EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-3/	2024-12-04T07:14:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170189636.jpg
Russia’s Oreshnik strike aftermath was a carefully orchestrated psyop, media reports	The media blitz following Russia&#x2019;s strike on Dnipro with a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on Nov. 21 was a carefully staged stunt designed to scare off the West, the Moscow Times reported on Dec. 3, citing four Russian official sources. The attack alarmed and puzzled civilians and international observers, who got used to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear saber-rattling that has been ongoing since the beginning of the war. Later on Nov. 21, Putin said in a televised address that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called Oreshnik. During a press conference, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a call on stage. The microphones overheard a man saying &quot;not to comment&quot; on questions regarding the new missile. This was all part of a plan to scare the West into submission, the Moscow Times reported, citing its sources. The propaganda offensive was coordinated between government, military, and intelligence officials, as well as PR experts, the outlet wrote. It came as a response to the West&apos;s decision to permit Ukraine to strike inside Russia with Western long-range arms. &quot;This show, which was staged and presented to the public,&quot; &#xA0;was composed of the actual Oreshnik strike, dissemination of footage on social media, and foreign media coverage, a Russian official told the Moscow Times. Speaking to the outlet, experts expressed skepticism about the feasibility of mass-producing the Oreshnik, saying that the weapon is still being tested and Russia lacks the technological means to mass-produce such a weapon. This undermines a later threat by Putin that he might strike &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv by the new Oreshnik.	https://kyivindependent.com/oreshnik-strike-propaganda/	2024-12-04T05:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2185403348.jpg
Bulgaria supplies arms, ammunition to Ukraine in its 7th aid delivery	Bulgaria is sending weapons, equipment, and ammunition to Ukraine in its already seventh package of military assistance, the BNR national broadcaster reported on Dec. 3. The exact list of supplies, provided in accordance with a decision on military support for Ukraine from late 2022, remains classified. Bulgaria&apos;s Defense Ministry said the donation would not endanger the Bulgarian military&apos;s capabilities. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev. Sofia began quietly shipping arms to Ukraine in the first year of the full-scale war. The largest donation publicly announced was composed of 100 older armored vehicles.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgaria-aid/	2024-12-04T05:19:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
NATO must provide 'whatever air defense we can give' to Ukraine, Rutte says	NATO countries will do all they can to provide Ukraine with air defenses necessary to protect its infrastructure but there is no surplus of such systems, Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Dec. 4. &quot;In the world, we do not have an overflow of supply of air defense systems. So that means that you always have to make sure that you prioritize,&quot; Rutte told journalists during the second ministerial meeting in Brussels. The previous day at the meeting, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that his country seeks at least 20 systems like NASAMS, HAWK, and IRIS-T to protect its critical infrastructure from Russian aerial strikes and prevent blackouts. &quot;But there was a clear agreement at the table last night that helping Ukraine, particularly with its infrastructure, has to be a priority,&quot; the secretary general continued. He did not provide a concrete number but voiced confidence that allies would provide Kyiv with whatever they could. &quot;We have to make sure that whatever air defense we can give them is being supplied to Ukraine.&quot; Ukraine has previously complained that the allies are slow in fulfilling their commitments, such as providing air defenses pledged during a July summit in Washington. Kyiv received a Patriot system from Romania in October and was promised two additional IRIS-T systems from Germany by the end of the year. Air defenses are likely to be crucial for Ukraine as the country braces for fresh Russian missile and drone strikes in what some warned may be the harshest winter of the war yet.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-provide-whatever-air-defense-we-can-give-to-ukraine-rutte-says/	2024-12-04T04:51:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GcwOcx5XsAEw_55.jpg
Controversial bill on state leaks fails to pass parliament	A bill proposing up to eight years imprisonment for accessing or disseminating confidential state register information during martial law failed to pass the parliament in its second reading on Dec. 4. The legislation was lambasted by the media and activists as an attempt to hamper investigations into corruption and other illicit activities by officials. The bill was sent to a repeated second reading by 229 votes, with &quot;only&quot; 213 voting in support of the bill, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The legislation passed its first reading in January despite heavy opposition within the parliament. Its proponents argue that it is meant to safeguard sensitive information during martial law. &quot;This is an attempt by the authorities to hide their dirty laundry from those who most often reveal it to the world, from investigative journalists,&quot; Vitalii Shabunin, head of the nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center&apos;s executive board, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. &quot;This draft bill poses significant threats to freedom of speech, the work of journalists, and the protection of journalists&apos; sources and corruption whistleblowers in Ukraine,&quot; wrote the Mediarukh (Media Movement), an informal organization of Ukrainian media, journalists and public organizations, in an open letter. Concerns about media freedom in Ukraine mounted this year following several cases of pressure against journalists, namely against outlets investigating misconduct among state officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/controversial-bill-on-state-leaks-fails-to-pass-parliament/	2024-12-04T04:05:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1643784971.jpg
Opinion: Georgia’s fight for democracy is at a breaking point	On Oct. 26, Georgia held parliamentary elections under a proportional system with a 5% threshold. According to the Central Election Commission, the ruling Georgian Dream party secured 53.93% of the vote, earning 89 parliamentary mandates but falling short of a constitutional majority. Opposition parties received 37.79% of the vote, securing 61 seats but disputing the election results. Domestic and international observers deemed the elections unfree and unfair, prompting the European Parliament to call for new elections under international supervision and EU sanctions against top Georgian officials for their authoritarian practices. Elections are foundational to democracy, representing vertical accountability by expressing the public will and ensuring fair, competitive access to political power. To be free and fair, elections require institutional guarantees such as freedom from coercion, equal campaign opportunities, transparency, and equitable resource allocation. Georgia&#x2019;s parliamentary elections fell far short of these standards, raising significant doubts about their legitimacy. In the pre-election phase, Georgian Dream pushed through a controversial law on foreign influence, targeting civil society organizations and media outlets. The controversial law sparked widespread protests, as it aimed to stifle political opposition and curtail NGO support for election monitoring. The ruling party also leaned heavily on anti-Western propaganda to deflect international scrutiny. The introduction of e-voting without adequate training or transparency disadvantaged opposition parties and voters, raising concerns about procedural fairness. Election commissions were overrepresented by Georgian Dream members, undermining credibility, while voting machines&#x2019; internet connectivity and registry system sparked fears of manipulation. Election-day irregularities compounded the problems. Election commission duties were not assigned by lot, as required by law, giving the impression of premeditated bias. Observers reported being denied access or even threatened by police, while ruling party surveillance cameras at polling stations violated voter secrecy. Additionally, ballot ink leaked, allowing third parties to identify voters&#x2019; choices. Although the Tetritskaro City Court ruled this a violation of ballot secrecy, the Tbilisi Court of Appeal overturned the decision in favor of the Central Election Commission. Vote-counting further revealed discrepancies, including mismatched protocols and wrongful vote allocations that impacted parliamentary seat distribution. In the post-election phase, Georgian Dream ignored constitutional safeguards, convening parliament despite pending legal challenges to MP election results. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili challenged the election&#x2019;s legality in the Constitutional Court, citing violations of ballot secrecy and universal suffrage. Georgian Dream pressed forward regardless, consolidating power and threatening to outlaw opposition parties with support from a judiciary loyal to the ruling party. International observers deemed the elections uncompetitive and marred by undue influence, undermining confidence in the electoral process and the legitimacy of Georgia&#x2019;s democracy. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze exacerbated the crisis by announcing a suspension of Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession bid until 2028, defying the public&#x2019;s pro-European aspirations enshrined in the Georgian Constitution. The decision ignited nationwide protests involving diverse political, social, and economic groups. Demonstrators demanded a democratic and European future, despite brutal crackdowns by riot police and special forces. Reports documented severe bodily harm inflicted on detainees, including journalists, in attempts to suppress dissent. In solidarity with the Georgian people, the United States suspended its strategic partnership with the Georgian government. U.S. lawmakers introduced bills, such as the &#x201C;Georgian People&#x2019;s Act&#x201D; and &#x201C;MEGOBARI Act,&#x201D; to counter Georgian Dream&#x2019;s authoritarian drift. Meanwhile, the Baltic states imposed sanctions on Georgian leaders responsible for democratic backsliding. Georgian Dream&#x2019;s actions have jeopardized Georgia&#x2019;s Euro-Atlantic aspirations and democracy. Exploiting fears of war with Russia, the ruling party used pro-government propaganda to divert attention from domestic failures and justify authoritarian policies. This strategy risks isolating Georgia internationally while falsely suggesting Russian acquiescence to reintegrating Abkhazia and South Ossetia. To counter this authoritarian slide, consistent and widespread mobilization is essential. Zurabishvili has united opposition parties to lead a pro-European movement and advocate for an interim government to oversee new elections under international supervision. Georgia&#x2019;s resilience demonstrates the power of grassroots democratization. The unwavering determination of its people to defend democratic values and align with the European Union sends a clear signal to the U.S. and EU: stronger international support is crucial to constraining authoritarian behavior and ensuring democracy becomes the only game in town.

Opinion: Does a savage war of partition await Ukraine?	Unlike during his first term in the White House, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appears determined to keep many of his campaign promises. His cabinet nominations &#x2014; from the Kremlin-friendly Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence to the conspiracy-loving vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as Secretary of Health and Human Services &#x2014; confirm Trump&#x2019;s commitment to a scorched-earth campaign against American institutions and perceived &#x201C;enemies within.&#x201D; And his victory speech suggests that he is serious about &#x201C;stopping wars&#x201D; &#x2014; beginning with the one in Ukraine. Trump has long asserted that he would end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. There has been much speculation about the settlement Trump has in mind, and the scenarios all have one thing in common: Ukraine&#x2019;s dismemberment. If this has to be the cost of peace, it is worth considering the grim history of territorial partition. Few events create such long-lasting enmity; fewer still have caused more devastating violence. The three partitions of Poland that took place in the late 18th century are perhaps Europe&#x2019;s closest parallel to Trump&#x2019;s vision for Ukraine. Beginning in 1772, Austria&#x2019;s Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire seized and annexed territory, effectively dividing Polish lands among themselves and erasing what had been Europe&#x2019;s largest state by landmass. In the face of such subjugation, violent resistance is all but inevitable. Poles conducted periodic guerrilla-style campaigns throughout the occupation, with major uprisings in 1831 and 1863. Resistance continued well into the 20th century, led by Josef Pi&#x142;sudski&#x2019;s campaigns for independence &#x2014; laced with acts of terror &#x2014; before World War I. Enmity toward Russia, in particular, endures to this day, with the Kremlin having Stalin-era violence toward the Polish people to answer for. As for France, it harbored hatred toward Germany for decades over Kaiser Wilhelm I&#x2019;s absorption of Alsace and Lorraine into the new German Empire following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. Reconciliation between the two countries began only in the 1950s, with the emergence of the European Coal and Steel Community (the precursor to today&#x2019;s European Union) and NATO. Similarly, Britain&#x2019;s decision to partition Ireland, keeping the largest part of the northern province of Ulster as part of the United Kingdom, incited a civil war between those willing to cede Northern Ireland, led by Michael Collins, and those who rejected any treaty that did not grant Ireland complete independence. That savage war of peace lasted just two years, but left a legacy of terror &#x2014; both Catholic and Protestant &#x2014; that ended only with the Good Friday Agreement, brokered by the United States, in 1998. Perhaps the most brutal partitions, however, occurred in Asia in the 20th century. In 1932, the Empire of Japan carved Manchuria out of the Republic of China and created the puppet state of Manchukuo. The Japanese Kwantung Army&#x2019;s ruthless 13-year rule there &#x2014; which included the enslavement of millions of people, perverse medical experimentation, and wholesale slaughter of minorities &#x2014; became something of a blueprint for the Nazis in Eastern Europe. So deeply held is Chinese resentment over Imperial Japan&#x2019;s savage occupation that, to this day, China&#x2019;s leaders invoke it to stoke opposition to the policies of modern democratic Japan. In terms of lives lost directly to a partition, however, nothing can compare to the 1947 division of the Indian subcontinent, following the departure of the British, into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. The partition triggered one of the largest migrations in history &#x2014; involving some 18 million people &#x2014; with Muslims heading to Pakistan (including modern-day Bangladesh), and Hindus and Sikhs trekking to India. Sectarian violence &#x2014; including rapes, burnings, and mass killings &#x2014; led to the deaths of as many as 3.4 million people. In the 77 years since the British Raj was partitioned, India and Pakistan have fought four wars, with the most recent &#x2014; the so-called Kargil War of 1999 &#x2014; occurring when both countries already possessed nuclear weapons. No historic rapprochement, &#xE0; la France and Germany, is in the offing. Vietnam&#x2019;s 1954 partition &#x2014; into a northern zone, governed by the communist Viet Minh, and a southern zone, governed by the Republic of Vietnam &#x2014; proved similarly bloody, as it unleashed two decades of war that left up to three million Vietnamese dead. (Remarkably, the Vietnamese do not seem to harbor a grudge against the United States, which lost 58,000 troops before withdrawing in 1975, for its role in their national agony). And then there is the 1947-48 partition of Palestine into an independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state. This decision by the United Nations sparked decades of hostility, oppression, terrorism, and wars that continue to this day. One need only to look at the ruins of Gaza to see the horrifying legacy of partition here. So, what might a partition of Ukraine yield? In fighting for their territorial integrity since February 2022, Ukrainians have demonstrated courage and dynamism &#x2014; qualities they will certainly bring to bear in rebuilding their country. But given the scale of the human and economic losses they have incurred, it will be hard for them to submit quietly to the idea of partition. It will be especially hard given that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of his belief that Ukraine is not just a &#x201C;neighboring country,&#x201D; but &#x201C;that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia,&#x201D; and, therefore, should exist only under the Russian umbrella. In any possible future peace negotiations, Ukrainians know that the best chance to prevent further Russian interference is through ironclad international security guarantees &#x2014; if not immediate NATO membership. Trump appears to loathe America&#x2019;s current security commitments, but for the U.S. not to offer such guarantees may prove harmful to Russia, too. Putin rose to power on the heels of a devastating war and a protracted insurgency in Russia&#x2019;s republic of Chechnya, which included terrorist attacks by Chechen separatists in Moscow and other Russian cities. Already in 2022, the Ukrainians promised a guerrilla war against Russia. Devoid of other options, that risk will only increase. Trump should seek to persuade the Kremlin of the need for fair negotiations; otherwise, post-partition terrorism may come to Russia, possibly on a greater scale than the Chechens ever imagined.

Ukraine's new Palianytsia missile-drone enters serial production, minister says	Ukraine&#x2019;s recently developed Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, has entered serial production, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in an op-ed on Dec. 4. &quot;A new start-up implemented the Palianytsa missile project, which has already entered serial production thanks to the support of the Defense Ministry,&quot; Umerov wrote in the article published by the LB.UA outlet. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners only recently allowed strikes in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast with foreign-made missiles but prohibited attacks deeper in the rear. One of these domestic-made weapons is the missile-drone hybrid named Palianytsia, which combines existing technologies to effectively strike deep into Russian territory. &quot;The use of foreign missiles often requires coordination with partners&#x2026; Ukrainian cruise and ballistic missiles will allow our Armed Forces to act independently, delivering pinpoint strikes on key enemy targets,&quot; Umerov wrote. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in November that Ukraine has produced its first 100 missiles. According to Umerov, Ukraine also resumed and scaled up serial production of Neptune cruise missiles, modifying them to have a greater range. There is a &quot;significant volume&quot; of new and long-term orders for first-person-view (FPV) drones, reconnaissance drones, long-range drones, and missile-drones, Zelensky said on Dec. 3 after a meeting with top officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-palianytsia-missile-drone-enters-serial-production-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-04T03:31:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-25-at-11_32_19.png
Russia, Belarus to set up joint military training centers, official claims	Russia and Belarus are planning to set up three training centers to jointly train soldiers, Gennady Lepeshko, a senior Belarusian security and defense official, claimed on Dec. 3, state-controlled news outlet Belta reported. &quot;Training is underway in military educational institutions of both countries,&quot; Lepeshko said. Training centers are expected to be established in Belarus&apos; Hrodna Oblast, as well as in Russia&apos;s Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad oblasts. According to the Belarusian official, Minsk and Moscow have signed more than 160 agreements on military cooperation and continue providing their armed forces with &quot;the most modern military equipment.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. The country is also reportedly hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory. Russian troops operated a torture chamber in the Belarusian town of Naroulia in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported in late November. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-belarus-to-set-up-joint-military-training-centers-official-claims/	2024-12-04T03:09:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1235255791.jpg
Abducted mayor tortured to death in Russian captivity, governor says	Yevhenii Matvieiev, the mayor of the occupied Dniprorudne town, was tortured to death in Russian captivity, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said on his Telegram channel on Dec. 4. &quot;People are the most valuable thing we are losing in this merciless war waged by the terrorist country of Russia,&quot; the governor said. Russian forces occupied the southeastern town of Dniprorudne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast during the early days of the war, taking the mayor to captivity and submitting him to torture, Fedorov said. Matvieiev spent two years and eight months in captivity before dying. His body was returned to Ukraine during the latest exchange. &quot;Yevhenii was a true patriot, not indifferent to the fate of his country and his community. He always worked with people and for people, listened, and helped everyone who needed it,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;During the occupation, he did not leave the town or the people, did everything to ensure the (continuation of the) life of the community, constantly informed the population about the course of events and supported them.&quot; Russia&apos;s occupation has been accompanied by widespread human rights abuses, including torture and murder of civilians. Mass kidnappings were not uncommon in Russian-occupied territories in the early days of the war and reached its apogee with the abduction of 20,000 children.	https://kyivindependent.com/yevhenii-matvieiev/	2024-12-04T02:42:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Mayor.jpg
As NATO ministers meet, some members continue to oppose membership invitation for Ukraine	A Ukrainian delegation is attending the NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3-4, hoping for an invitation to join the alliance, but recent statements and reports suggest that a consensus is unlikely. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who is present at the meeting, urged members to send the invitation this week as a step toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. Kyiv has previously rejected other security guarantees as substitutes for full membership, comparing them to the Budapest Memorandum from 1994 that failed to prevent aggression against the country. An undisclosed NATO source told the Ukrainian Suspilne outlet that the U.S. and Germany continue to oppose inviting Ukraine at the moment, even though German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Dec. 3 that Kyiv&apos;s membership as a way to secure long-term peace is a conceivable possibility. Hungary and Slovakia, whose leaders have consistently opposed military aid to Ukraine and called for a normalization of relations with Moscow, have publicly opposed inviting Kyiv to join the alliance. Another NATO member joining the opposition is Luxembourg, whose Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel said that Ukraine&apos;s accession would lead to the resumption of tensions, Der Spiegel reports. At the same time, Bettel spoke in favor of Ukraine joining the EU. According to Politico&apos;s report from October, other countries, such as Belgium, Slovenia, and Spain, oppose Ukraine joining the alliance, even though they are less vocal about their stance. Ukraine&apos;s accession would require a unanimous agreement among all the 32 members, and the recent entry process of Finland and Sweden showed that obstructions by even a small number of countries could prolong the process for months and even years. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. In separate comments on a potential invite on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat if Ukraine were to join NATO.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-meeting-ukraine/	2024-12-04T02:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188054525.jpg
Ukraine, EU sign agreement on up to 35 billion euro loan covered by Russian assets revenue	Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry and the EU signed a memorandum and an agreement to attract up to 35 billion euros ($36.7 billion) as part of the G7 loan, the ministry said on Dec. 4. The European Commission unveiled the 35-billion-euro loan in September within the framework of the G7&apos;s broader $50 billion loan, which is covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets. The funding is ever more crucial for Ukraine, as Russia&apos;s war continues to take a staggering toll on the country&apos;s economy, and the future of Western support under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump remains uncertain. The final amount of the EU&apos;s contribution will be determined &quot;after all parties to the initiative approve the amount of loans.&quot; As the U.S. promised to contribute $20 billion, the EU&apos;s assistance might eventually amount to 18 billion euros ($18.9 billion), the ministry said. Kyiv expects revenues from the roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets in G7 countries to be used to repay the loan rather than Ukraine&apos;s own resources. The country&apos;s parliament recently passed a bill to that effect, positing that it would not repay the G7 loan without reparations from Russia. &quot;The next important step is to raise funds from the frozen assets of the aggressor country. In recent months, we have been actively working with the European Union and other parties within the initiative to achieve concrete results in meeting Ukraine&apos;s financial needs in 2025 and beyond,&quot; Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement. &quot;I am grateful for the constructive cooperation and readiness to implement fair decisions in a short time.&quot; The Biden administration announced its $20-billion contribution in October, only a few weeks before the election victory of Trump, who has been more critical of the aid following to Ukraine. Other G7 members, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, are also expected to contribute to the loan.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-sign-agreement-on-up-to-35-billion-euros/	2024-12-04T01:23:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1785291162.jpg
German FM doesn't rule out deploying troops to Ukraine in case of ceasefire	Germany does not rule out deploying troops to Ukraine to ensure a ceasefire, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said during a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. Baerbock told journalists that in order to achieve long term peace in Ukraine, security guarantees such as Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership and deployment of international troops, including German ones, are conceivable. The comments follow media reports about the U.K. and France also discussing sending its soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine. European troops overseeing a peaceful post-war situation in the country were reportedly included in a peace plan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team. Baerbock, a member of Germany&#x2019;s Green party, has represented a more pro-Ukrainian voice in the governing coalition with Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who adopted a more cautious approach on certain issues. Earlier this year, the chancellor rejected a proposal by French President Emmanuel Macron to send military trainers to Ukraine. Scholz also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. The chancellor remained adamant about not transferring Taurus missiles to Ukraine even after the U.S. reversed course and allowed Ukraine to strike Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles. Germany is heading toward snap elections in February, with polls favoring the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, whose chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz adopted a tougher rhetoric toward Russia and called for more decisive steps in support of Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-doesnt-rule-out-deploying-troops-to-ukraine-to-ensure-ceasefire/	2024-12-04T01:01:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Russian attacks against Kherson, Donetsk oblasts kill 6, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least six people and injured at least 16 over the past day, regional authorities said on Dec. 4. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 29 of the 50 Russian drones overnight, the Air Force said. Eighteen drones were lost, and one flew to occupied territories, according to the statement. In Donetsk Oblast, four people were killed and 11 injured over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. An artillery attack against the city of Kostiantynivka killed a 52-year-old man and injured four people, the governor said. Another person was reportedly killed and three injured during an attack on the town of Pokrovsk. One civilian was killed and another injured in Kotlyne, one was killed in Dachne, two were injured in Druzhkivka, and one in Zvirove, according to Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and five injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twenty houses, a cell tower, and an outbuilding were reported as damaged. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Poltava, Ternopil, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-109/	2024-12-04T00:39:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-04_10-00-30.jpg
Chinese man arrested in US on suspicions of arms shipments to North Korea	A Chinese man illegally residing in the U.S. was arrested for allegedly shipping weapons to North Korea from the U.S., the Justice Department said in a statement on Dec. 3. &quot;Shenghua Wen, 41, of Ontario, California, was arrested today on a criminal complaint alleging that he exported shipments of firearms, ammunition, and other military items to North Korea that were concealed inside shipping containers bound from Long Beach,&quot; the statement read. According to the charges, Wen, a student who overstayed his visa, sent concealed firearms, ammunition, and export-controlled technology in shipments bound from Long Beach through Hong Kong to North Korea, violating sanctions on the country. Law enforcement found 50,000 rounds of 9 mm ammunition in his flat, and he faces up to 20 years of prison if found to be guilty. A Russian military delegation, led by Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, arrived in North Korea on Nov. 29, raising international concerns over deepening ties between the two nations, particularly following North Korea&#x2019;s deployment of thousands of troops to Russia last month. Following the visit, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country would &quot;invariably support&quot; Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia&#x2019;s defense chief. North Korea has been shipping shells, missiles, and soldiers to Russia in exchange for what seems to be oil products and advanced rocket technology.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-man-arrested-in-us-on-suspicions-of-arms-shipments-to-north-korea/	2024-12-04T00:05:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2179986631.jpg
Opinion: What Ukraine expect from the European Parliament’s new term	The European Parliament has long upheld democracy, human rights, international law, and peace. This tradition has been especially evident in its robust response to Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine. As the Parliament enters its 2024-2029 term, we examine its political stance over the past two years and assess what Ukrainians can expect moving forward. Following Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Parliament responded decisively. It condemned the war in the strongest terms, decrying atrocities such as the deportation of Ukrainian civilians, including children, and the abuses in so-called &quot;filtration camps.&quot; It also rejected Russia&#x2019;s illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories and denounced the sham referendums held in occupied regions. In November 2022, the Parliament designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and condemned its use of terrorist tactics. It also recognized the Holodomor, the Soviet-orchestrated famine of the 1930s, as genocide. The Parliament consistently pushed for accountability, advocating for the establishment of a special international tribunal to prosecute Russian leaders for war crimes. It also passed multiple resolutions supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and calling for closer EU-Ukraine ties, including a June 2022 resolution urging the European Council to grant Ukraine EU candidate status. These actions enjoyed widespread support, with votes typically ranging from 470 to 520 in favor out of 705 members. Despite predictions of upheaval, the 2024 European Parliament elections did not result in dramatic changes. While Euroskeptic and far-right parties gained ground, they remain a minority. Pro-Ukraine groups &#x2014; including the center-right European People&#x2019;s Party (EPP), the center-left Socialists, the liberal centrist Renew Europe, and the Greens &#x2014; retain a commanding majority of over 400 seats out of 720. The new Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to Ukraine in its first resolution of July 2024, calling for continued military aid and condemning Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s visit to Moscow. It also emphasized the need to maintain and expand sanctions against Russia and Belarus. This resolution passed with 495 votes in favor, 137 against, and 47 abstentions. Subsequent resolutions underscored this pro-Ukraine stance. In September 2024, the Parliament urged lifting restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western weapons against Russian targets. In October, it approved a 35-billion-euro ($36.9 billion) loan to Ukraine, financed by revenues from frozen Russian assets. By November, it demanded stricter sanctions against Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet, which is involved in circumventing sanctions on crude oil. These actions highlight the Parliament&#x2019;s unwavering support for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and EU integration aspirations. This support is expected to translate into backing for Kyiv&#x2019;s funding needs, accession steps, and favorable political resolutions.

(Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images)Several key factors will shape the European Parliament&#x2019;s future actions regarding Ukraine: First, reforms in Ukraine. The Parliament will closely monitor Ukraine&#x2019;s progress on economic, political, and judicial reforms, particularly anti-corruption efforts. The European Commission&#x2019;s regular reports on these reforms will significantly influence parliamentary decisions. Second, EU public opinion. Public support for Ukraine&#x2019;s EU integration varies across member states. War fatigue, migration challenges, and shifting media narratives could sway public sentiment, influencing how Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) vote on Ukraine-related issues. Third, EU relations with Russia and global powers. While an EU-Russia rapprochement seems unlikely, changes in U.S. foreign policy &#x2014; such as a friendlier stance toward Russia under a potential Trump administration &#x2014; could lead the European Parliament to adopt a firmer stance against Moscow. Fourth, economic cooperation. Deepening economic ties through the EU-Ukraine free trade agreement will likely bolster support for Ukraine within the Parliament, as successful trade integration strengthens mutual interests. And fifth, the war&#x2019;s outcome. The trajectory of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine remains the most significant factor. Developments on the battlefield, whether advances, ceasefires, or escalations, will directly impact parliamentary priorities and decisions. The European Parliament is poised to maintain its strong support for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and EU integration ambitions. However, this commitment will depend on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to implement necessary reforms, shifting public opinion within the EU, evolving geopolitical dynamics, and the outcome of the war. Over the next five years, the Parliament must navigate these challenges while upholding its principles of democracy and international law.

Ukrainian drones allegedly strike Russia's Ryazan Oblast, explosions reported near airbase	Russian authorities claimed Ukrainian drones attacked Ryazan Oblast overnight on Dec. 4, with Telegram channels reporting explosions in the area of the Dyagilevo airbase. At least four drones were shot down over the western Russian region overnight, Governor Pavel Malkov claimed. &quot;At the crash site of a downed drone in the Korablinsky district, windows of four nearby houses were damaged. There were no casualties,&quot; Malkov claimed. The Korablinsky district lies roughly 60 kilometers (around 40 miles) south of the regional center, Ryazan. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported destroying 35 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including four over Ryazan Oblast. The Russian news channel Astra wrote that Ryazan residents heard explosions near the Dyagilevo airbase on the city&apos;s outskirts. There have been no official comments on the situation in the regional center or the airbase. Kyiv has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The Dyagilevo airbase, lying almost 500 kilometers &#xA0;(300 miles) from the Ukrainian border, reportedly hosts the 43rd Center for Combat Training with Tu-22M3, Tu-95MS, Tu-134UBL, and An-26 aircraft, as well as Il-78 tanker planes and a repair plant. A Ukrainian drone is said to have struck the airbase in December 2022, killing and injuring several soldiers. The military facility was allegedly targeted again in July 2024. Kyiv&apos;s forces have been launching drone attacks ever deeper into Russian territory, targeting military bases and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ryazan-oblast-drones/	2024-12-03T23:33:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Diagylevo.jpg
200 mental health centers to be launched in Ukraine	Ukraine plans to establish nearly 200 mental health facilities, the Health Ministry reported on Dec. 3. &#x201C;We strive to create a network of mental health centers that will become a key link for people who need highly specialized help,&#x201D; the ministry&#x2019;s statement said. These centers will complement existing psychological support provided by family doctors, school psychologists, libraries, and resilience centers. So far, 23 centers have been launched across eight regions, with 119 multidisciplinary teams already formed. The new facilities will offer psychosocial care, psychiatric services, and community-level support, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children, veterans, and displaced persons. Starting Janunary 2025, these centers will operate under the Medical Guarantees Program to ensure state-funded access to care. &#x201C;Mental health centers are not only about treatment, but also about support, accessibility, and comfort for everyone who needs help,&quot; Health Minister Viktor Liashko commented. The Health Ministry estimates that 1.8 million people among Ukraine&apos;s military personnel and veterans may require psychological support. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that 22% of people who have &quot;experienced war or other conflicts will have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.&quot; The collective impact of population displacement, chronic sleep deprivation, fear of attacks, and economic hardships contribute significantly to the deteriorating mental health of Ukrainians.	https://kyivindependent.com/200-mental-health-centers-to-be-launched-in-ukraine/	2024-12-03T22:46:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1713626967.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 747,370 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 747,370 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 4. This number includes 1,670 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,493 tanks, 19,450 armored fighting vehicles, 30,746 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,002 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,020 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,946 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-747-370-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-03T22:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Tucker Carlson says he's back in Russia and interviewed Lavrov	U.S. far-right pundit Tucker Carlson said on Dec. 4 that he returned to Moscow for an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, promising it would be released &quot;very soon.&quot; &quot;So we came back to Moscow yesterday to interview the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, the longest-serving foreign minister in the world,&quot; Carlson said in a video released on X. A former Fox News host and a close ally to President-elect Donald Trump, Carlson visited Russia&apos;s capital in February for a controversial interview with President Vladimir Putin. Speaking with the Kremlin in the background, Carlson said he came to talk with Russia&apos;s chief diplomat about whether Moscow and Washington are heading toward a nuclear conflict in the wake of the Biden administration&apos;s decision to lift restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia. The commentator added that he had just finished the interview and that it would be published soon. In his comments, the controversial pundit claimed that &quot;American military personnel launched missiles into mainland Russia that killed at least a dozen Russian soldiers,&quot; calling this an &quot;undeclared war&quot; that is closer to a nuclear exchange than the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Carlson provided no evidence for his assertion about the involvement of U.S. troops. The claim closely echoed Putin&apos;s previous statements that Ukraine is unable to use long-range missiles without the direct involvement of NATO personnel and that such a step would mean the West&apos;s direct involvement in the war. The commentator also said he asked Lavrov whether Trump&apos;s victory would mean an end to the war. The U.S. president-elect has promised to bring both sides to the negotiating table, with some fearing he might push Kyiv toward painful concessions. Carlson, whose commentary has been described as nativist, racist, and peddling falsehoods, has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration&apos;s support for Ukraine. After his interview with Putin, Carlson was lambasted for platforming the Russian leader amid the full-scale invasion, not pressing him on difficult subjects, and not confronting his distortions of history.	https://kyivindependent.com/tucker-carlson-lavrov/	2024-12-03T22:39:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1332866552.jpeg
BBC includes 2 Ukrainians in list of 2024 most influential women	The BBC&apos;s &quot;100 Women 2024&quot; list, which was published on Dec. 3, featured two Ukrainians, Olha Olefirenko and Olha Rudnieva. Rudnieva founded the Superhumans center in Lviv, which provides prosthetics and rehabilitation to war-injured Ukrainians, serving over 1,000 people in its first two years. Ukrainian officials estimate that over 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs as a result of Russia&#x2019;s war. Olefirenko, a farmer, fulfilled her late father&apos;s dream by modernizing her farm, supported by the Ukrainian Veterans Fund. Through her initiative, she was able to create many new jobs for her community. Olefirenko&#x2019;s father was killed on the front lines in Donbas, while on duty.

Slovenia assures continued assistance to Ukraine at NATO foreign ministers meeting	Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon reaffirmed her country&#x2019;s strong support for Ukraine during the two-day ministerial NATO meeting in Brussels, Ukrinform reported on Dec. 4. &quot;Slovenia provides significant support to Ukraine in the form of material, humanitarian, and military aid and will continue to do so as long as it is necessary,&quot; she said to journalists at the meeting. Fajon discussed the specific equipment needs with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and reiterated Slovenia&apos;s commitment to Ukraine&apos;s defense. She condemned Russia&#x2019;s use of North Korean troops and its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, emphasizing that supporting Ukraine is both a moral obligation and a shared interest. NATO&apos;s two-day ministerial meeting will focus on providing Ukraine with enough military aid to enable it to enter any possible negotiations from a position of strength, Secretary General Mark Rutte said ahead of the meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. Slovenia had secretly provided Ukraine with various military equipment when the U.S. aid had been stalled for months, the Slovenian media outlet 24UR reported on June 13. After six months of political infighting and delays, the U.S. passed a long-awaited $61 billion aid package in April, with much of it covering military aid. While Kyiv was waiting for the approval of the U.S. bill, Slovenia sent 20 armored fighting vehicles armed with a 12.7 mm caliber weapon, six armored fighting vehicles armed with a 3x20 mm caliber weapon, three infantry fighting vehicles, and a shipment of drones to Ukraine, according to the outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovenia-assures-continued-assistance-to-ukraine-at-nato-foreign-ministers-meeting/	2024-12-03T18:43:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1486097657.jpg
UNESCO adds Ukrainian egg decoration to intangible cultural heritage list	The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has added the Ukrainian art of egg decoration to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, Ukraine&apos;s Culture Ministry announced Dec. 3. UNESCO&apos;s committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage began its 19th session in Paraguay on Dec. 2. The committee inscribed &quot;Pysanka: Ukrainian tradition and art of egg decoration&quot; to its Representative List. &#x201C;This is our shared success, which demonstrates the strength of our unity,&quot; Culture and Strategic Communications Minister Mykola Tochytskyi said. &quot;At the same time, the aggressor is destroying our culture, monuments, theaters, libraries, and museums. In the fight for our homeland, our artists &#x2014; bearers of living heritage &#x2014; are perishing. ... We, however, are proving that even in the darkest times, we remain unbroken.&quot; Ukrainian Easter eggs, known as pysanky, are decorated with complex patterns and dyed using a wax-resist method. The practice predates Christianity, and the meanings of the symbolic decorations have changed over time. The colorful eggs are an internationally recognized symbol of Ukrainian culture. The Culture Ministry worked with the Foreign Ministry, Ukraine&apos;s Permanent Delegation to UNESCO, Ukraine&apos;s National Commission for UNESCO Affairs, and artisans who practice the tradition to secure the official designation. The addition of pysanky to the Representative List comes as Russia continues to target and destroy cultural heritage sites in Ukraine. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has destroyed over 1,000 of these sites, including those under the protection of UNESCO. As Russian drones and missiles target historic buildings, uplifting and safeguarding Ukraine&apos;s traditional practices takes on new significance. &quot;We declare to the whole world: living heritage unites us, gives us a sense of belonging, and embodies our identity,&quot; Tochytskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/unesco-adds-ukrainian-egg-decoration-to-intangible-cultural-heritage-list/	2024-12-03T15:47:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2150547947.jpg
UK must help put Kyiv 'in strongest possible position' for peace talks, Starmer says	The United Kingdom must continue supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia, in order to &quot;put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for negotiations,&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a speech delivered Dec. 2 and published Dec. 3. Starmer&apos;s remarks come as Europe prepares to step up military support for Ukraine ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. Trump is expected to push Kyiv into negotiations with Moscow. &quot;So we must continue to back Ukraine and do what it takes to support their self-defense for as long as it takes,&quot; Starmer said at the annual Lord Mayor&apos;s Banquet in London. &quot;To put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for negotiations so that they can secure a just and lasting peace on their terms that guarantees their security, independence, and right to choose their future.&quot; Starmer said that support for Ukraine was in the best interest of not only the U.K., but all of Europe, arguing that unchecked Russian aggression posed to great a threat to international security. &quot;The further Russian troops advance, the closer the threat becomes,&quot; he said. &quot;The more land they control, the more they control grain prices and energy sources, and the more confident (Russian President Vladimir) Putin becomes.&quot; With Trump&apos;s return to Washington imminent, both the U.K. and France are reportedly exploring options to support Ukraine in potential peace talks with Russia. A senior NATO official said on Dec. 2 that one scenario could include deploying U.K. and French troops to monitor a ceasefire along the contact line. Starmer backed up his rhetoric on support for Ukraine with shipments of Storm Shadow cruise missiles this fall, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 26. Ukrainian forces recently used the Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets in the western Bryansk region, one day after deploying U.S.-made ATACMS in similar operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-must-help-put-kyiv-in-strongest-possible-position-for-peace-talks-starmer-says/	2024-12-03T14:43:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187414183.jpg
Yermak to visit US for talks with Trump's team, NV reports	Andriy Yermak, the head of the Presidential Office, will visit the United States on Dec. 4 to lead a Ukrainian delegation in meetings with members of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inner circle, the Ukrainian outlet New Voice reported, citing diplomatic sources. The delegation will reportedly include Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, according to the source. Trump will return to the White House next month, instigating a dramatic change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. While Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support aand adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia. The Ukrainian delegation will meet with a number of U.S. officials on their visit, sources told NV. &quot;But the main purpose of this trip is to meet with Trumpists, people from the entourage of US President-elect Donald Trump,&quot; one source said. Yermak is expected to meet with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s nominee for special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, another source said. As special envoy, Kellogg will play a key role in shaping future negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Yermak will discuss Trump&apos;s policy toward Ukraine and their vision for a peace plan with Kellogg during the visit, the source said. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions against Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/yermak-to-visit-us-for-talks-with-trumps-team-nv-reports/	2024-12-03T13:23:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Fall of Aleppo deals blow to Russia's Middle East clout, may indirectly strengthen Ukraine's hand	The shock capture of Aleppo by Syrian forces opposed to Bashar al-Assad in recent days has dealt a humiliating blow to the regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, analysts have told the Kyiv Independent. The surprise offensive has also indirectly helped Ukraine, analysts say. &quot;This is really quite the conundrum (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has to solve,&quot; said Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. There is much at stake for Russia &#x2014; if Assad&apos;s regime falls, Russia will lose its regional foothold in the Middle East, including its only naval base in the Mediterranean, and its regional and global influence will be diminished. But propping up Assad and defending the Syrian capital of Damascus from any rebel advance will require military support that Moscow may not be able to spare when the vast bulk of its forces are fighting in Ukraine. &quot;Russia is stretched thin so the costs to intervene are high, and the geopolitical benefits may be smaller than (when it first intervened in the Syrian Civil War in 2015),&quot; Bruchmann added. Russia and Syria have a long history of close relations, particularly on the military front, and the threat to this alliance from recent events was amply demonstrated in a video posted by rebel forces as they took over a military office in Aleppo adorned with Russian and Syrian flags. Russia has operated its Tartus naval base in Syria since 1971, and it runs the Khmeimim Air Base and other military facilities in the country. &quot;Syria represents Moscow&apos;s only military foothold in the Mediterranean,&quot; Neil Quilliam, a Middle East expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It also showcases Russia as a reliable ally willing to defend its partners, reinforcing its credibility in the region.&quot; Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (R) meets with his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 24, 2024. (Valery Sharifulib/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Bruchmann agreed that &quot;Tartus is vital for Russian power projection in the entire Mediterranean and North Africa.&quot; &quot;It functions as an extended logistics hub for wider ambitions and Russia&apos;s support to allies there,&quot; he added. &quot;Over the past months, it typically hosted a small flotilla of surface ships, several smaller boats, and at times a submarine, all guarding a fleet of civilian container and supply ships.&quot; Scott Lucas, professor of international politics at University College Dublin, said that Russia was using the Tartus base to &quot;offset where the Americans are up in the northeast of Syria&quot; and project its power against Europe and China as well. Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group formerly affiliated with Al Qaeda, as well as the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army and other groups, launched their surprise offensive on Aleppo on Nov. 27. They have captured most of the city since then. When Assad&apos;s regime captured Aleppo in 2016 after years of fighting for the city, Russia&apos;s military intervention was a major reason behind his success. Since 2015, Russia has sent warplanes, tanks, artillery, and ground troops to Syria. Human rights groups have documented numerous war crimes committed by Russia&apos;s air force and other troops against civilians. &quot;There is a lot of damage to residential areas,&quot; Fared Al Mahlool, a Syrian journalist on the ground in Aleppo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There are many victims, including wounded children. The Russians think we are all terrorists, but they are liars.&quot; At the peak of its intervention, Russia had about 5,000 regular troops and thousands of Wagner mercenaries in Syria, according to Western media and analysts. Quilliam said that &quot;Russia maintains several thousand troops in Syria, though exact numbers are difficult to verify.&quot; &quot;Estimates range between 3,000 and 5,000, supported by airpower, naval assets, and military advisors,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Quilliam added that &quot;the war in Ukraine has compelled Russia to reallocate significant military resources, including some from Syria.&quot; &quot;Reports suggest that several hundred personnel, particularly those involved in advanced weaponry operations, have been reassigned to support the conflict in Ukraine,&quot; he continued. &quot;This redistribution has strained Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its military operations in Syria at previous levels.&quot; Aron Lund, a Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, also said that &quot;Russia has a much lighter military footprint in Syria now than before invading Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The idea was always to keep a certain presence in the country and then be able to scale that up or down as needed,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It worked well until 2022, when Putin made the strategic blunder of invading Ukraine, overtaxing his armed forces to the point that he could no longer spare significant resources for anything else.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses troops during his visit at Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia, Syria on Dec. 11, 2017. (Photo by Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)Bruchmann said that &quot;Russia has withdrawn some but not all ground forces (from Syria) since 2022.&quot; Iran and its proxies, which have been instrumental in propping up Assad&apos;s regime, have also been busy elsewhere in recent months. Iran&apos;s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, had been at war with Israel until they reached a ceasefire on Nov. 26, while the Gaza-based Hamas has been at war with Israel since October 2023. Iran and Israel also struck each other directly several times earlier this year. Olli Ruohom&#xE4;ki, a Middle East expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent that Israel took out Iranian military installations and &quot;managed to degrade Hezbollah&apos;s capabilities.&quot; The fall of Aleppo took several days, with the speed of the rebel offensive shocking observers. Analysts say that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and Iran&apos;s confrontation with Israel contributed to Assad&apos;s failure to hold on to the city. &quot;Had Russia had more resources to work with in Syria, it&apos;s possible that it would have slowed the rebel advances early on and helped shore up morale among Assad&apos;s forces,&quot; Lund said. &quot;That said, the regime is in bad shape, and Iranian and Hezbollah backing had also withered a bit, so it&apos;s possible that the collapse would have come about even with much more solid Russian support.&quot; Quilliam argued that &quot;the &apos;status quo&apos; that came to characterize Syria&apos;s situation since 2020 was never going to be sustainable, and events elsewhere in the region showed the opposition that the &apos;myth&apos; about Hezbollah&apos;s dominance was a paper tiger.&quot; &quot;The same could be said for the Assad regime at a time when Moscow and Tehran were overstretched with their own struggles,&quot; he added. Lucas said the fall of Aleppo was &quot;a huge blow to the Russians and Assad.&quot; He added that it also &quot;helps Ukraine in a couple of ways.&quot; &quot;(Putin has) got this different theater that he&apos;s got to pay some attention to again,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem here is that if he decides to go on the offensive in Syria, then it makes his hand much more difficult to play in Ukraine.&quot; He also said that the situation in Syria &quot;gives (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky a much stronger hand to play at the table if Russia is in trouble elsewhere.&quot; Experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent say that it will be hard for Russia and Iran to lend a hand to Assad. &quot;In many cases, (Russian) military police and some lighter ground forces remain with several observation posts on the Syrian Golan,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;These ground forces are not capable of securing the Syrian regime. That job will have to fall to Iran and its proxies.&quot; He added that &quot;the Russian Air Force is still able to act as support for the Syrian army and Iranian proxies, currently flying bombing sorties&quot; and that &quot;over the next days, Russian jets will likely try to slow down the Tahrir al-Sham advance until Syrian, Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy forces can organize a defense.&quot; &quot;Russia and Iran face significant economic and political constraints that limit their ability to provide full-scale support,&quot; Quilliam said. &quot;Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions have strained its economy, while Iran faces its own challenges, including the degrading of the Axis of Resistance and international sanctions.&quot; Meanwhile, Lucas said that Russia had been &quot;reticent to commit their support to Assad regaining these areas.&quot; Michael Sahlin, a former Swedish ambassador to Turkey and a Middle East and Central Asia specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said that Russia would likely have to limit itself to airstrikes in helping Assad&apos;s regime. He also told the Kyiv Independent that Russia would also be cautious to get involved in Syria too much to avoid antagonizing U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January and initiates talks with the Kremlin. Russia&apos;s involvement could also spoil its relations with Turkey, which backs some of the rebels, according to Sahlin. Lund was more cautious, saying that &quot;Russia and Iran will do their best to shore up Assad&apos;s defenses and perhaps help him launch a counteroffensive.&quot; &quot;They may not be able to spare a lot, but even smaller contributions could be useful for Damascus,&quot; he added. &quot;The Syrian war is not on the scale of Ukraine. If you throw some jets or a few thousand battle-tested troops into the mix, it can make a difference.&quot; Quilliam argued that &quot;the erosion of Assad&apos;s control could also undermine Russian and Iranian influence in Syria and the broader Middle East, and that is a cost too high for Moscow and Tehran.&quot; &quot;Russia risks losing its military bases and influence in the Middle East, weakening its geopolitical position,&quot; he said. &quot;Moscow&apos;s image as a power capable of countering the U.S. influence and stabilizing its allies would be severely damaged. This could embolden adversaries, such as the U.S., Turkey, and Gulf states, to assert greater influence in Syria, undermining Russian strategic ambitions.&quot; Lund agreed that &quot;should the regime fall, Russian interests in the Middle East and North Africa would take a bad hit.&quot; &quot;But ultimately, Syria isn&apos;t essential to Russia as such, and while the Middle East matters, it&apos;s not a core interest for Moscow,&quot; he said. &quot;The war on Ukraine will be prioritized a million times higher.&quot; However, it is too early to predict Assad&apos;s imminent downfall. Ruohom&#xE4;ki said that the Aleppo offensive is unlikely to lead to the fall of Assad&apos;s regime because Russia would want to preserve it to keep its foothold in the Middle East. &quot;I don&apos;t think the Syrian government is about to fall,&quot; Lund said. &quot;Losing Aleppo will be the hardest blow to Assad yet, and it will make a huge difference to the conflict and to how the country functions. Even so, Assad runs a really tenacious regime that has proven its intransigence many times.&quot; He added that &quot;we&apos;re likely to see a period of intense fighting, and then further down the line, there will be a new, wobbly equilibrium propped up by ceasefire deals negotiated between Russia, Turkey, and perhaps Iran.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fall-of-aleppo-deals-blow-to-russias-middle-east-clout-may-indirectly-strengthen-ukraines-hand/	2024-12-03T13:06:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188066204.jpg
Yale study names over 300 Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia	A study from the Yale School of Public Health published Dec. 3 has identified 314 children forcibly deported from Ukraine to Russia and placed into Russia&apos;s system of coerced adoption and fostering. Since February 2022, nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database. Russia has carried out a &quot;systematic, intentional, and widespread&quot; program of forced adoption and Russification of Ukrainian children, the study found. The children identified in the report were all taken from Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. According to the study, child placement databases in Russia have falsely listed Ukrainian children as if they were born in Russia. Some agencies operating the databases later limited the publicly available data regarding Ukrainian children after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children&#x2019;s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2023. Like the ICC, the Yale researchers determined that Putin and Lvova-Belova ordered and facilitated the system of child deportation and forced assimilation into Russian families. The study reported that Russia&apos;s Aerospace Forces and military aircraft transported multiple groups of children in 2022 under Putin&apos;s orders. The study also found that children from Ukraine had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia, and after deportation were subjected to pro-Russia re-education before being placed in Russian families. Psychologists and mental health professionals are involved in the coerced adoption program to help &quot;legitimize&quot; Russia&apos;s human rights abuses with claims that the family placements are medically necessary. Over 60 of the 314 children identified in the study have been naturalized as Russian citizens since their abduction, the study found. The data gathered in the study will be presented to the ICC as evidence of Russian war crimes.	https://kyivindependent.com/yale-study-names-over-300-ukrainian-children-forcibly-deported-to-russia/	2024-12-03T12:50:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1258482532.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv won't accept security guarantees substituting NATO membership	Key developments on Dec. 3: Ukraine will refuse any kind of security guarantees substituting NATO membership, according to a Foreign Ministry statement on Dec. 3. &quot;Having the bitter experience of the Budapest Memorandum behind us, we will not settle for any alternatives, surrogates, or substitutes for Ukraine&apos;s full membership in NATO,&quot; the statement said just two days before the 30th anniversary of the memorandum&apos;s signing. NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels between Dec. 3 and 4, with Ukraine also participating. Kyiv urged the allies to issue a membership invitation during the meeting, but Reuters reported that there is a lack of consensus on the matter. Ukraine gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapon arsenal in the Budapest Memorandum in 1994 in exchange for the recognition of its borders and security guarantees by the U.S. and Russia, among others. The ministry&apos;s statement called upon &quot;the U.S. and Great Britain, which signed the Budapest Memorandum,... France and China, which joined it,&quot; and &quot;all the states participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot; to support Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO to counteract Russian blackmail attempts. Ukrainian troops managed to fend off Russian forces attempting to establish a foothold on the western side of the Oskil River north of the Kharkiv Oblast town of Kupiansk, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 3. The military published footage of the engagement that reportedly took place near the village of Novomlynsk, lying some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kupiansk. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached its industrial outskirts in the northeast. Recently, Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attempts at entering the town. Thanks to numerical advantage, Russian forces managed to cross the Oskil River, seeking to establish a bridgehead on the other side, the General Staff said. Ukrainian forces have heavily fortified the west side of the Oskil River to prevent Russian forces from approaching Kupiansk from the north. Reports about Moscow&apos;s troops successfully forcing the river near Novomlynsk surfaced in late November. &quot;At the same time (as Russia was establishing the bridgehead), Ukrainian defenders, supported by artillery and drone units, forced out Russian forces from the bridgehead,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the date of the engagement. &quot;Namely, soldiers of the 8th Separate Assault Battalion of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade &apos;Edelweiss&apos; cleared the area near Novomlynsk of Russian forces.&quot; The military said that the western bank of the Oskil River is under Ukrainian control, showing footage of Ukrainian soldiers raising a state flag in Novomlynsk. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage of Russian forces crossing the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast and of Ukrainian forces raising a flag in Novomlynsk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, published on Dec. 3, 2024. (General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces/Telegram)France, UK discuss deploying troops to Ukraine for ceasefire monitoring, sources tell RFE/RLParis and London are exploring options to support Ukraine in potential peace talks with Russia, including deploying French and U.K. troops to monitor a ceasefire along the contact line, a senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The official, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, noted that these discussions are happening in individual capitals, not within the formal NATO structure. The aim is to prepare for various scenarios, ensuring European countries are ready to assist Kyiv if the new U.S. administration requests greater European involvement. According to the official, the proposals also seek to secure European allies&apos; participation in peace talks that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could mediate. French and British discussions on leading a military coalition in Ukraine have gained momentum, with Le Monde reporting renewed talks about deploying troops. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told BBC News that while France is not currently planning to send troops into combat, the country &quot;does not discard any option.&quot; &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometer, the threat gets one square kilometer closer to Europe,&quot; Barrot said. Ukraine is appealing to its NATO partners to provide at least 20 air defense systems to help repel Russian aerial attacks, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said ahead of an allied meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. The provision of HAWK, NASAMS, and IRIS-T batteries will help avert blackouts, Sybiha said as Ukraine braces for fresh attacks in the third winter of the full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s diplomacy chief is in Brussels to attend the NATO foreign ministers&apos; meeting and participate in the Ukraine-NATO Council session. Kyiv seeks to secure not only additional military assistance but also the much-coveted invitation to join the alliance. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meeting, Sybiha brought the Budapest Memorandum, a document signed by Ukraine, Russia, and Western powers in 1994. In accordance with the agreement, Kyiv gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. &quot;This document failed to secure Ukrainian security and Trans-Atlantic security. So we must avoid repeating such mistakes,&quot; Sybiha said. &quot;That&apos;s why, of course, we will discuss with my partners the concept of &apos;peace through strength,&apos; and we have a clear understanding of which steps we need from our friends to do our homework.&quot; During an interview with Kyodo News published on Dec. 1, President Volodymyr Zelensky disputed reports in Western media that as many as 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed during the full-scale war with Russia. &quot;Recently, some in, I believe, the American press reported that 80,000 Ukrainians had been killed. I want to tell you that, no, (the number of those killed is) less, much less,&quot; Zelensky said, while refusing to provide a detailed number of casualties. &quot;However, we have to be honest, we do not know how many Ukrainian have been killed on occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comments likely refer to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s claims published on Sept. 17 that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the war, with a further 400,000 wounded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-48/	2024-12-03T11:38:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Protests in Georgia, explained	For the fifth day in a row, Georgians are holding massive protests in the country&apos;s capital, Tbilisi. The brewing dissatisfaction was ignited by the country&apos;s democratic backsliding under the leadership of the pro-Russian, increasingly illiberal government. The final straw appeared to be the parliament elections won by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which many believe were marred by fraud, and the government&apos;s decision to pause the country&apos;s EU accession process until 2028. Hundreds have been detained and dozens injured during an ensuing crackdown by riot police.

(Davit Kachkachishvili/Anadolu via Getty Images)The Georgian Dream party has been in power since 2012 and spent years pledging to take the country into the EU. However, the party&apos;s rule has been marked by the development of closer ties with Moscow and the introduction of a number of repressive legislations that mimic that of Russia. Relations with the EU, as well as with Ukraine, have deteriorated. The party is led by a controversial oligarch and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia&apos;s richest man, who has business ties in Russia. In the run-up to the election, Georgian Dream campaigned on a platform of reminding voters of the 2008 war with Russia, using images of war-torn Ukraine as a fear-inducing tactic to dissuade people from seeking closer ties with the EU. For this reason, protesters in Georgia can be seen with EU and Ukrainian flags and symbols, as well as Georgia&apos;s national flag. Georgia&apos;s Oct. 26 parliamentary elections sparked a new cycle of protests, as opposition parties claimed the vote was rigged. Georgian Dream declared victory despite reports of ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other irregularities. Opposition groups refused to recognize the result of the Oct. 26 parliamentary election and said the election was stolen. Georgia&apos;s pro-EU President Salome Zourabichvili said she would not recognize the results and called for citizens to join her in mass demonstrations. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, one of the leaders of Georgian Dream, said on Oct. 27 that parliament would approve the government. Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commission took three weeks to count all votes and examine complaints about irregularities before announcing on Nov. 16 that Georgian Dream had received 53.93% of the vote, giving it 89 seats in the 150-seat parliament.

(Giorgi Arjevanidze/AFP via Getty Images)Protesters occupied a busy junction of downtown Tbilisi on Nov. 17 with tents, but the police dispersed them a day later. Protesters gathered again on Nov. 18, but police officers violently dispersed the crowds, demolished the camp, and detained several participants. A new round of protests followed Kobakhidze&apos;s statement that Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union could be postponed until 2028, prompting outrage among some in society, who are demanding changes in the country&apos;s political course. Police reportedly used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse demonstrators in Tbilisi on Nov. 29. Protests then spread to Batumi, Zugdidi, Kutaisi, Telavi, Gurjaani, and other Georgian cities. Over 220 people were arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons. The EU and U.S. called on Oct. 27 for an investigation into the irregularities during the election. The European Commission then announced on Oct. 30 that the process of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union has been suspended due to the actions of the Georgian government since the spring of 2024. The talks remain &quot;on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU, our values, and our principles,&quot; EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawel Herczynski said. While the European Council had agreed in December 2023 to grant candidate status to Georgia, the Georgian government passed a controversial foreign agents law in May 2024, overruling a veto by President Zourabichvili.

( Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)The law, which mirrors similar Russian legislation targeting civil society, sparked mass protests in Georgia in the spring of 2024. Georgian Dream initially introduced the bill in early 2023 but scrapped it in March 2023 following widespread demonstrations. The speaker of the Georgian parliament, Shalva Papuashvili, signed the law in June 2024 and the legislation came into effect on Aug. 1, requiring organizations that receive foreign funding to register with the Justice Ministry or face a fine. In response, the EU de facto halted Georgia&apos;s accession process and froze 30 million euros ($32 million) in defense sector funding. Washington also paused more than $95 million in assistance to Georgia due to the law, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on July 31. Following the outbreak of mass protests in late November, the EU&apos;s chief diplomat at the time, Josep Borrell, released a statement in support of the Georgian people &quot;and their choice for a European future.&quot; Borrell also noted that Kobakhidze&apos;s announcement to suspend EU accession talks &quot;marks a shift from the policies of all previous Georgian governments and the European aspirations of the vast majority of the Georgian people, as enshrined in the Constitution of Georgia.&quot; Publicly, Russia has refrained from openly siding with Georgian Dream but insinuated that outside forces are attempting to destabilize Georgia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Dec. 2 that the protests were a domestic matter for Georgia, but drew comparisons with Ukraine&apos;s Orange and EuroMaidan revolutions. Ukraine&apos;s Orange Revolution in 2004-2005 was sparked by the mass fraud during the 2004 presidential elections in favor of pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych. The mass protests resulted in an election rerun that was won by pro-EU candidate Viktor Yushchenko. The 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution broke out after President Yanukovych, who had been elected in 2010, decided not to sign an association agreement with the EU. Georgia and Russia broke off diplomatic relations in the wake of the war in 2008 but the Georgian Dream government oversaw a gradual normalization of mutual ties. The two countries resumed direct flights last year, while the trade relations between the two countries have continued to grow, increasing the South CaucasusCaucasus&apos; country&apos;s dependence on its northern neighbor. Russia currently controls two Georgian regions &#x2014; South Ossetia and Abkhazia &#x2014; which together account for almost 20% of the country&apos;s territory. Shortly before the election, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree on expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. The decree came as the EU weighed potentially ending Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the bloc.	https://kyivindependent.com/protests-in-georgia-explained/	2024-12-03T10:36:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187469358-1.jpg
Ukraine, US sign energy resilience memorandum worth $825 million	Ukraine and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in ensuring the resilience of Ukraine&apos;s energy system in Brussels on Dec. 3, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said. The document, signed by Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers&apos; meeting, includes U.S. aid totaling up to $825 million. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system has been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war. Earlier strikes devastated coal, oil, and hydroelectric power plants, making the remaining nuclear facilities critical to the country&#x2019;s electricity supply. According to the ministry, the memorandum aims to restore Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure, introduce distributed generation, reform the energy sector, and facilitate the post-war transition to a low-carbon, competitive, and European-integrated economy. The news came as Kyiv is calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities ahead of winter. Russia launched nearly 100 drones and 90 missiles against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. Ukraine introduced emergency blackouts across the country following the recent attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-sign-energy-resilience-memorandum/	2024-12-03T10:24:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186239232.jpg
Ombudsman denies Russian claim that Kyiv is delaying prisoner exchanges	Kyiv is ready to bring back all Ukrainians from Russian captivity, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Dec. 2, denying the claims of his Russian counterpart Tatyana Moskalkova. Lubinets&apos;s response came after Moskalkova published alleged lists of 600 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) held in Russia, whom Kyiv allegedly &quot;did not agree to take back.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is not delaying and did not delay the exchanges, but on the contrary, declared its readiness to repatriate seriously injured and seriously ill prisoners by creating a mixed medical commission,&quot; the Ukrainian ombudsman said. &quot;And the party that is not really interested in returning and implementing the exchanges is still ignoring the creation of such a commission.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War echoed Lubinets&apos; remarks. Dmytro Usov, the secretary of the organization, said that Russian lists include seven Ukrainian soldiers who have already been exchanged, 14 civilians, and pointed out mistakes in the names and dates of birth of captured ones. According to Usov, Russia offered Ukraine to swap only those Russian soldiers captured in embattled Kursk Oblast. &quot;The Russian authorities are not interested in captured Russians from other regions,&quot; he added. &quot;This Russians&apos; game is only for the public, and it is especially cynical. They are manipulating the fate of people and the vulnerable situation of their relatives.&quot; Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the two sides have frequently exchanged prisoners. The most recent swap occurred in mid-October, with each side bringing back 95 prisoners. According to Lubinets, 3,767 Ukrainian prisoners of war have returned home since the start of the all-out war. Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-bring-back-all-ukrainians-from-captitivity-ombudsman-says-amid-russian-allegations/	2024-12-03T09:41:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2153578361.jpg
Abkhaz council votes against ratification of controversial agreement with Russia	The council of Russian-occupied Abkhazia against a controversial investment agreement with Moscow, which sparked mass protests last month, Interfax reported on Dec. 3. Twenty-one lawmakers voted against the law, which sought to permit Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia, while two abstained. Abkhazia is internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but is under illegal occupation by Russian forces, which back the local breakaway leadership. In late October, representatives of Russia and Abkhazia signed an investment agreement in Moscow. Soon after, demonstrators in Abkhazia rallied outside the local proxy parliament, denouncing the deal as one-sided and advantageous only to Moscow. Despite the council&apos;s decision to postpone the agreement&apos;s consideration, protesters demanded an immediate vote to reject it. Aslan Bzhania, president of the breakaway state submitted his letter of resignation on Nov. 19. Abkhazia has recently drawn attention due to rumors of accelerated construction at the Ochamchire naval base, allegedly being developed by Russia. Despite satellite imagery showing construction activity, Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba claimed in September that there are &quot;no plans&quot; for a Russian naval base in the occupied region, which lacks a navy of its own. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine would target Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet &quot;wherever it is stationed,&quot; hinting at potential strikes on Russian-controlled areas of Georgia, including Abkhazia.	https://kyivindependent.com/abkhaz-council-votes-against-ratification-of-controversial-agreement-with-russia/	2024-12-03T08:22:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173673388.jpg
Ukraine accelerating missile production, Zelensky says	Ukraine is accelerating the country&apos;s missile production, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 3 following a meeting with top officials. Zelensky was briefed on contracts for the production of Ukrainian-made weapons. There is a &quot;significant volume&quot; of new and long-term orders for first-person-view (FPV) drones, reconnaissance drones, long-range drones, and missile-drones, he added. The officials also discussed the missile program and testing of new types of missiles. &quot;We can thank our Ukrainian missile developers. We are accelerating production,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. As of early November, Kyiv has produced its first 100 missiles, according to Zelensky. Previously, the president revealed that Ukraine had tested a domestically-produced ballistic missile and missile-drone, Palianytsia. Domestic artillery production contracts were also a subject of the recent meeting, as Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult situation on the battlefield. The European Union has delivered 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine, fulfilling the pledge it initially promised to deliver by the spring of 2024, the EU&#x2019;s new top diplomat Kaja Kallas told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 1. To become more independent from Western partners, Kyiv tries to ramp up its own domestic ammunition production.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-accelerating-missile-production-zelensky-says/	2024-12-03T07:03:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russia to send mercenaries to Syria to reinforce its troops, Ukrainian intelligence claims	Russia is sending private mercenaries to Syria to reinforce its troops, possibly its so-called Africa Corps, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed on Dec. 3. &#x201C;Moscow&apos;s leaders decided to send mercenaries from &#x2018;private military companies&#x2019; to the Middle Eastern country to help them. The arrival of fighters &#x2013; probably from the so-called &#x2018;Africa Corps&#x2019; &#x2013; is expected,&quot; the statement read. Syrian rebels swept into the northwestern city of Aleppo on Nov. 30, launching a major attack that forced Russian-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad&#x2019;s army to pull back. &quot;The Syrian government army and Russian military units are suffering significant losses, fleeing their positions, abandoning weapons and equipment, the retreat is chaotic,&quot; the Ukrainian intelligence agency claimed in its statement. Russia&apos;s Africa Corps reportedly emerged in 2023 and consists of soldiers, officers, and experienced mercenaries, many of whom previously served in the Wagner Group. This group was very likely previously deployed in Syria, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims, and HUR did not provide evidence to support them. Russia&apos;s leadership has dismissed General Sergei Kisel, who commanded Moscow&apos;s military group in Syria, HUR said earlier. Russian forces have reportedly ramped up their bombing of rebel forces following the takeover of Aleppo.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-syria-mercenaries/	2024-12-03T05:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186671158.jpg
Journalists, anti-corruption groups denounce Ukraine’s attempt to increase punishment for state leaks	Parliament was scheduled to vote on Dec. 3 on a new law proposing up to eight years imprisonment for accessing or disseminating confidential state register information during martial law, a bill that Ukrainian media and human rights organizations have urged parliament to reject on free speech concerns. However, parliamentary voting ended for the day without the bill coming up for vote. &#x201C;This is an attempt by the authorities to hide their dirty laundry from those who most often reveal it to the world, from investigative journalists,&#x201D; Vitaliy Shabunin, head of the nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center&apos;s executive board, said about the bill. &#x201C;Moreover, not just to hide information, but to imprison those who help journalists &#x2013; their sources &#x2013; and curb investigative actions not only of journalists, but also of the editorial offices of large media outlets where their investigations are published,&#x201D; Shabunin told the Kyiv Independent. Recent investigations that have exposed corruption in Ukraine &#x2013; such as reporting on illegal border-crossing schemes and the enrichment of officials in the Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office &#x2013; would have been illegal to publish under the new law had it been in place at the time, and could have carried harsh sentences for the journalists or their sources. Ukrainian and foreign journalists attend the press conference of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 25, 2024. (Volodymyr Tarasov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)While the bill was on the parliamentary schedule for a Dec. 3 vote, a source in parliament told the Kyiv Independent that representatives of the European Union and G7 have appealed to parliament&#x2019;s leadership, requesting a postponement of the vote in order to assess its compliance with EU law. It is unclear what the next plans for the bill are. Parliament passed the bill in a first reading in January. At the time, many lawmakers opposed the bill, but it was allowed to continue to the second reading. On Nov. 27, parliament&#x2019;s Committee on Law Enforcement recommended adopting the draft law and sent it to parliament for a second and final reading. Proponents of the law say it is a matter of national security during martial law to protect sensitive information. If the bill is passed, it will be sent to President Volodymyr Zelensky to be signed into law. Current legislation carries a minor punishment for the illegal dissemination of nonpublic register information. The new changes to the criminal code would designate this activity a more severe type of violation and give law enforcement additional powers for carrying out investigations against sources and journalists suspected of violating the law, including secret wiretapping. In an open letter published on the eve of the scheduled vote, journalists, media activists and human rights organizations urged parliament to reject the bill. &#x201C;This draft bill poses significant threats to freedom of speech, the work of journalists, and the protection of journalists&apos; sources and corruption whistleblowers in Ukraine,&#x201D; wrote the Mediarukh (Media Movement), an informal organization of Ukrainian media, journalists and public organizations, in an open letter. The law does not contain any protections for those who disclose confidential information that is of public importance, and the proposed punishment is disproportionate, the letter says. A photo of a meeting between the G7 ambassadors and prominent Ukrainian journalists in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 2, 2024. (G7/X)&#x201C;The transformation of such offenses into serious crimes opens up the possibility of using secret investigative actions against journalists, in particular wiretapping and surveillance, which significantly violates the standards of protection of information sources,&#x201D; the letter says. Among the signatories of the open letter were major anti-corruption organizations and investigative reporting outlets in Ukraine, including the Anti-Corruption Action Center, Bihus.info, Ukrainian Pravda, and Slidstvo.Info. Lawmaker Yaroslav Yurchshyn, who heads parliament&#x2019;s Freedom of Speech Committee, wrote on Facebook last week that he would urge his colleagues in the Holos party not to vote for the bill. &#x201C;There are incredibly cool investigative journalists in Ukraine, whose work will simply be killed by this draconian bill. And this will be a huge gift to corruption lovers,&#x201D; Yurchyshyn wrote. &#x201C;You can dance around alleged information security for a long time, but all this looks like an attempt to attack freedom of speech.&#x201D; Ukrainian media organizations have been raising concerns for months of increased pressure from authorities. After attempts to discredit and intimidate journalists earlier this year produced widespread condemnation, media organizations have continued to name examples of censorship attempts, political interference, and allegations of journalists being drafted into service as retribution for their coverage.	https://kyivindependent.com/journalists-anti-corruption-groups-denounce-ukraines-attempt-to-increase-punishment-for-state-leaks/	2024-12-03T05:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155584258.jpg
Ukraine asking NATO for 20 air defense systems to prevent blackouts	Ukraine is appealing to its NATO partners to provide at least 20 air defense systems to help repel Russian aerial attacks, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said ahead of an allied meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. The provision of HAWK, NASAMS, and IRIS-T batteries will help avert blackouts, Sybiha said as Ukraine braces for fresh attacks in the third winter of the full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s diplomacy chief is in Brussels to attend the NATO foreign ministers&apos; meeting and participate in the Ukraine-NATO Council session. Kyiv seeks to secure not only additional military assistance but also the much-coveted invitation to join the alliance. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meeting, Sybiha brought the Budapest Memorandum, a document signed by Ukraine, Russia, and Western powers in 1994. In accordance with the agreement, Kyiv gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. &quot;This document failed to secure Ukrainian security and Trans-Atlantic security. So we must avoid repeating such mistakes,&quot; Sybiha said. &quot;That&apos;s why, of course, we will discuss with my partners the concept of &apos;peace through strength,&apos; and we have a clear understanding of which steps we need from our friends to do our homework.&quot; Earlier today, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement rejecting any &quot;alternatives, surrogates, or substitutes for Ukraine&apos;s full membership in NATO,&quot; presenting the Budapest Memorandum as an example of failed assurances. The statement came only two days ahead of the 30th anniversary of the document&apos;s signing. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. Several allies remain opposed to Ukraine&apos;s quick accession to the alliance, including Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary, according to earlier reporting and statements. Reuters reported that an invitation during the upcoming summit was unlikely due to a lack of consensus among NATO members.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-20-air-defense-systems/	2024-12-03T05:26:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Sybiha-Brussels.jpg
Western sanctions force Russian importers to smuggle their goods, media reports	The latest Western sanctions against 50 Russian banks forced Russian importers to use complex and underhand schemes to pay their Chinese sellers, the Moscow Times reported on Dec. 2, citing undisclosed business sources. The news comes as financial transactions between the two countries are becoming increasingly difficult under Washington&apos;s growing scrutiny. U.S. sanctions on 50 banks in November cut the last ties serving Russian importers to directly pay their Chinese sellers, forcing them to use dubious intermediaries springing up across Russia instead, the Moscow Times wrote. According to the new scheme, the intermediary accepts the Russian ruble and, using &quot;great administrative power,&quot; transfers it to the Chinese seller for a commission of approximately 3%, a financial consultant told the Moscow Times. In the case of dual-use or sanctioned goods, importers resort to illegal means of bringing them into the country, including smuggling. The weakness of the ruble also contributed to delays in deliveries from China, as suppliers halted the supply of their goods. Overwhelming evidence shows that Russian military hardware, especially drones, contain parts supplied by China. Recent reports indicate that the EU obtained evidence of China&apos;s production of &quot;lethal aid&quot; for Russia, namely attack drones. Loopholes and malicious actors allowed countries and individuals to evade sanctions and continue doing business with Russia, necessitating the introduction of further packages and fine-tuning of the existing ones.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-sanctions-force-russian-importers-to-smuggle-their-goods-media-reports/	2024-12-03T04:40:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1383091414.jpg
Parliament approves Naftogaz chief Chernyshov as deputy PM and 'minister for national unity'	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine&apos;s parliament on Dec. 3 supported the candidacy of Oleksii Chernyshov for the position of a vice prime minister and the &quot;minister for national unity,&quot; lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The new minister&apos;s powers remain unclear. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the department as part of Ukraine&apos;s resilience plan, saying it would focus on strengthening relations with Ukrainians living abroad. Even before the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian diaspora has been widespread around the world, with particularly large communities in the EU, the U.S., and Canada. The war drew millions more from their home, with some 6.7 million living as refugees abroad as of August 2024. Chernyshov served as the governor of Kyiv Oblast between October 2019 and March 2020 and as the communities and territories development minister between March 2020 and November 2022. Since 2022, Chernyshov has been the CEO of the Naftogaz Group, Ukraine&apos;s state-owned energy giant. According to Zhelezniak, a new head of the company will be selected. Chernyshov&apos;s candidacy was supported by 237 lawmakers.	https://kyivindependent.com/chernyshov/	2024-12-03T04:16:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1820446236.jpg
Ukrainian journalists meet G7 ambassadors to discuss country's media landscape	Ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries met with prominent Ukrainian journalists on Dec. 2 for a &quot;valuable exchange&quot; and to discuss &quot;the current media landscape.&quot; &quot;Press freedom and pluralism are crucial for strengthening democracy, supporting political debate, and advancing Ukraine&#x2019;s Euro-Atlantic path,&quot; the G7&apos;s representation in Ukraine said on X. It marked the second such meeting this year, with the G7 envoys meeting Ukrainian journalists in January amid complaints of systematic state pressure on the media community. Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief of the Kyiv Independent; Vitalii Sych, editor-in-chief of NV; Andrii Boborykin, executive director of Ukrainska Pravda; Nataliia Lyhachova, director-in-chief of Detector Media; and Mykola Chernotytskyi, the CEO of the Suspilne public broadcaster attended the latest meeting. Yurii Nikolov, an investigative journalist and co-founder of the Nashi Hroshi project; Nataliia Sedletska, head of the Kyiv bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; and Yevhenii Shulhat, an investigative journalist at the Slidstvo.Info outlet, were also in attendance. Nikolov and Shulhat themselves experienced pressure from the authorities in two separate cases this year that prompted a backlash from the journalistic community. Nikolov, who revealed procurement wrongdoing in the Defense Ministry under its previous leadership, received a threatening visit to his home from two unknown men in January. Shulhat was allegedly targeted by military enlistment this spring amid his investigation into the family property of Illia Vitiuk, at the time serving as the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) cybersecurity chief. Another major scandal revolved around leaked private recordings of non-editorial staff members of the Bihus.Info investigative outlet apparently using drugs during a New Year&apos;s party. Bihus.Info later released an investigation that said a department of the SBU installed the hidden cameras and leaked the videos to pressure the outlet. Despite the subsequent public outcry and pledge by the authorities to rectify the situation, media watchdogs and journalists have continued to point to cases of attempted censorship, political interference, and other forms of pressure. In one of the latest cases, Ukrainska Pravda said in October the Presidential Office is systematically pressuring the outlet in an attempt to influence its editorial policy. The outlet said that officials were being ordered not to communicate with its journalists, they were being denied access to official events, and businesses were being pressured to cease advertising on the outlet&apos;s website and not sponsor the events Ukrainska Pravda organizes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-journalists-meet-g7-ambassadors/	2024-12-03T03:40:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-03_12-03-12.jpg
We must focus on military aid — NATO chief sidesteps question on invitation for Ukraine	NATO&apos;s two-day ministerial meeting will focus on providing Ukraine with enough military aid to enable it to enter any possible negotiations from a position of strength, Secretary General Mark Rutte said ahead of the meeting in Brussels on Dec. 3. Rutte dodged a journalist&apos;s question about whether Ukraine should expect an invitation during the meeting, saying only that &quot;allies agree that the future of Ukraine is in NATO.&quot; &quot;And during the Washington summit, we agreed on the irreversible path towards NATO,&quot; the secretary general added, referencing the outcomes of the allied meeting in July. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha asked on Nov. 29 that his NATO counterparts issue an invitation for Ukraine during the meeting in Brussels. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. The matter becomes ever more pressing as Kyiv sees the invitation as a key condition for a just and lasting peace. Discussions about possible peace talks next year are mounting as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to find a quick end to the war and bring both sides to the negotiating table. &quot;The meeting in the next two days will very much concentrate on how to make sure that Ukraine, whenever it decides to enter into peace talks, will do so from a position of strength,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;And to get there, it is crucial that more military aid will be pumped into Ukraine.&quot; Several allies remain opposed to Ukraine&apos;s quick accession to the alliance, including Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary, according to earlier reporting and statements. Reuters reported that an invitation during the upcoming summit was unlikely due to a lack of consensus. According to an earlier statement by Trump&apos;s pick for a Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, Ukraine could temporarily forego NATO aspirations in exchange for alternative security guarantees and arms. In a statement issued ahead of the meeting and the subsequent Ukraine-NATO Council session on Dec. 3, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry rejected any guarantees that would serve as substitutes for a full NATO membership. &quot;Having the bitter experience of the Budapest Memorandum behind us, we will not settle for any alternatives, surrogates, or substitutes for Ukraine&apos;s full membership in NATO,&quot; the statement said just two days before the 30th anniversary of the memorandum&apos;s signing. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. In separate comments on a potential invite on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat if Ukraine were to join NATO.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-nato-meeting-ukraine/	2024-12-03T03:34:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
German court sentences killers of Ukrainian basketball players to 8.5-10 years	A court in the German city of Essen on Dec. 2 sentenced four teenagers to between eight and a half to 10 years in a youth detention center for the murder of two Ukrainian basketball players earlier this year, German media reported. Volodymyr Yermakov, 17, and Artem Kozachenko, 18, were attacked with knives in Oberhausen in February. Yermakov died in the hospital the same day, while Kozachenko succumbed to his injuries 10 days later. The perpetrators were between 14 and 15 years old at the time of the attack and included two Syrian citizens and two German citizens, the ARD news channel reported. Deutsche Welle reported that one of the Germans also holds Greek citizenship. Due to the perpetrators&apos; age, the proceedings were held in a juvenile court behind closed doors. While the prosecutors initially assumed that the victims were attacked for being Ukrainian, the court could not establish a xenophobic motive. The perpetrators were &quot;looking for trouble,&quot; a court spokesperson said, according to the WDR broadcaster. According to the court&apos;s ruling, the perpetrators sought to provoke a conflict during a journey on a bus with the victims giving them no reason to do so. After getting off the bus, Yermakov and Kozachenko were beaten and fatally stabbed. The verdict took other previous crimes into account, with some of the attackers considered repeat offenders. One of the defendants reportedly admitted to the knife attack, while others to the beatings. Two perpetrators will now serve 10 years in a youth detention center, and the other two eight and a half. Their defense plans to appeal the verdict. The two Ukrainian basketball players fled to Germany in 2023 due to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, joining the ART Giants basketball team in Dusseldorf.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-court-ukrainian-basketball-players/	2024-12-03T01:48:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1583888600.jpg
Ukraine prevents Russia from establishing bridgehead west of Oskil River, military says	Ukrainian troops managed to fend off Russian forces attempting to establish a foothold on the western side of the Oskil River north of the Kharkiv Oblast town of Kupiansk, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 3. The military published footage of the engagement that reportedly took place near the village of Novomlynsk, lying some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kupiansk. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached its industrial outskirts in the northeast. Recently, Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attempts at entering the town. Thanks to numerical advantage, Russian forces managed to cross the Oskil River, seeking to establish a bridgehead on the other side, the General Staff said. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage of Russian forces crossing the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast and of Ukrainian forces raising a flag in Novomlynsk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, published on Dec. 3, 2024. (General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces/Telegram)Ukrainian forces have heavily fortified the west side of the Oskil River to prevent Russian forces from approaching Kupiansk from the north. Reports about Moscow&apos;s troops successfully forcing the river near Novomlynsk surfaced in late November. &quot;At the same time (as Russia was establishing the bridgehead), Ukrainian defenders, supported by artillery and drone units, forced out Russian forces from the bridgehead,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the date of the engagement. &quot;Namely, soldiers of the 8th Separate Assault Battalion of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade &apos;Edelweiss&apos; cleared the area near Novomlynsk of Russian forces.&quot; The military said that the western bank of the Oskil River is under Ukrainian control, showing footage of Ukrainian soldiers raising a state flag in Novomlynsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/oskil-river-novomlynsk/	2024-12-03T01:04:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1590093192.jpg
Ukraine won't accept security guarantees substituting NATO membership	Ukraine will refuse any kind of security guarantees substituting NATO membership, according to a Foreign Ministry statement on Dec. 3. &quot;Having the bitter experience of the Budapest Memorandum behind us, we will not settle for any alternatives, surrogates, or substitutes for Ukraine&apos;s full membership in NATO,&quot; the statement said just two days before the 30th anniversary of the memorandum&apos;s signing. NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels between Dec. 3 and 4, with Ukraine also participating. Kyiv urged the allies to issue a membership invitation during the meeting, but Reuters reported that there is a lack of consensus on the matter. Ukraine gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapon arsenal in the Budapest Memorandum in 1994 in exchange for the recognition of its borders and security guarantees by the U.S. and Russia, among others. The ministry&apos;s statement called upon &quot;the U.S. and Great Britain, which signed the Budapest Memorandum,... France and China, which joined it,&quot; and &quot;all the states participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot; to support Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO to counteract Russian blackmail attempts. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. In separate comments on a potential invite on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat if Ukraine were to join NATO.

Rutte tells Trump 'bad peace' in Ukraine could embolden US rivals	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has told U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that Washington would face a &quot;dire threat&quot; from China, Iran, and North Korea if Ukraine is forced to accept an unfavorable peace deal, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 2. China&apos;s President Xi Jinping &quot;might get thoughts about something else in the future if there is not a good deal,&quot; Rutte told Trump in an apparent reference to Taiwan, as the NATO chief revealed in an interview with the outlet. Rutte met the U.S. president-elect in Florida on Nov. 23 amid fears that Trump might scale down the U.S. participation in NATO and its support for Ukraine as it faces Russian aggression. Speaking to the Financial Times, the NATO chief warned against allowing the leaders of Russia, Iran, and North Korea to celebrate a &quot;deal which is not good for Ukraine&quot; as that would be &quot;a dire security threat not only to Europe but also to the U.S.&quot; in the long-term. Tehran and Pyongyang are Moscow&apos;s key allies in its all-out war against Ukraine, providing arms and, in North Korea&apos;s case, soldiers to boost Russian forces. Trump&apos;s return to the White House is raising concerns about the stability of Western support for Ukraine, as the president-elect pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring the conflict to a swift end. Ukrainian officials have appealed to Trump to maintain his support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia. The details of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, but his pick for a special peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, previously proposed freezing the war along the current front lines and postponing Kyiv&apos;s NATO aspirations. Ukraine hopes to receive a NATO invitation &#x2014; a step included in its five-step victory plan &#x2014; during an allied ministerial summit on Dec. 3-4, but media reports suggest that there is a lack of consensus on the matter.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-rutte-peace-in-ukraine/	2024-12-02T23:40:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/241123-SG-Trump_rdax_775x440s.jpg
Slovakia’s PM Fico lashes out at EU for expressing support for Ukraine	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the EU&#x2019;s new leadership over their supporting words for Ukraine during a press conference on Dec. 2. Fico said he had called European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen to convey to her his disagreement. The Slovak prime minister has repeatedly criticized the EU&apos;s support for Ukraine and said he would seek to normalize relations with Russia after the war. EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas and the new president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, visited Kyiv on Dec. 1. They reiterated the EU&#x2019;s support for Ukraine, upsetting the Slovak prime minister. &quot;Neither members of the Commission nor the president of the European Council can permit themselves to make statements, in the name of the European Union, on which the European Union and the European Council have never agreed,&quot; Fico was quoted as saying. &quot;They made statements that did not correspond to the conclusions of the European Union.&quot; During a news conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky following their meeting in Kyiv, Costa said that the EU would continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and military assistance to Ukraine, including 4.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) to support the Ukrainian budget by the end of the year. In 2025, the EU will also transfer 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to Ukraine monthly. A Russian-friendly populist, Fico halted military aid to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks after taking office in September 2023 in a stark foreign policy reversal. He recently announced he had accepted the Kremlin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-eu-ukraine/	2024-12-02T23:13:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/main-2.webp
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 8 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least one person and injured at least eight over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 3. Moscow&apos;s forces targeted energy infrastructure facilities in several regions as Ukraine enters its third winter of the full-scale war. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 21-year-old man was injured during Russian attacks against the Nikopol district, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Eight houses, a high school building, a shop, a gas station, and other buildings were damaged. Russian attacks against the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast killed one person and injured another, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were reportedly wounded during strikes against the village of Shevchenko. In Kharkiv Oblast, an 80-year-old woman was injured during a Russian attack with a multiple-launch rocket system against the Prystyn village near Kupiansk, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Three people were injured during Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A multi-story building, 12 houses, and other buildings were damaged. A Russian attack against Rivne Oblast damaged an emergency facility infrastructure, Governor Oleksandr Koval said. No casualties were reported. An energy infrastructure site was also damaged during a drone attack against the city of Ternopil, resulting in a fire. No casualties were reported, but some residents were left without electricity as a result, Mayor Serhii Nadal said. Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-3/	2024-12-02T22:57:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Nikopol-Dec-3.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 745,700 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 745,700 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 3. This number includes 1,780 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,486 tanks, 19,419 armored fighting vehicles, 30,666 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,976 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,019 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,917 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-745-700-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-02T22:13:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-2.jpg
NATO unlikely to issue membership invite to Ukraine at upcoming meeting, Reuters reports	NATO countries will likely sidestep Ukraine&apos;s call to provide the embattled country with an invitation into the military alliance during the upcoming NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4, Reuters reported, citing multiple diplomats. &quot;It will take weeks and months to get consensus,&quot; an unnamed senior NATO diplomat told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. &quot;I don&apos;t see that happening tomorrow, I would be very surprised.&quot; Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. The comments come as Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha asked on Nov. 29 that his NATO counterparts issue an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance during the meeting in Brussels. &quot;I urge you to endorse the decision to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance as one of the outcomes of the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4,&quot; Sybiha wrote at the time, pointing at the threat of Russian escalation through its use of the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, as well as the involvement of North Korean troops. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky also suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. In separate comments on a potential invite on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat if Ukraine were to join NATO. Amid a recent shift in rhetoric, Zelensky said in in interview with Japan&apos;s Kyodo News that Ukraine might have to liberate some Russian-held territories through diplomatic means after the country&apos;s NATO membership becomes certain, as the country&apos;s military &quot;lacks the strength&quot; to do so immediately. Despite Ukraine&apos;s pleas to join the alliance, a senior U.S. official told Reuters that the Dec. 3-4 meeting would focus on bringing Ukraine into the strongest possible position next year, &quot;going into possible negotiations.&quot; &quot;The best way to (support Ukraine) is to surge money, munitions, and mobilization,&quot; the U.S. official added. The comments comes as the Biden administration continues to make series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations, ahead of the January inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump &#x2014; who has criticized military support for Kyiv. Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, previously said that Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-unlikely-to-issue-ukraine-membership-invite-at-upcoming-meeting-reuters-reports/	2024-12-02T20:17:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russian drone attack on Ternopil damages energy infrastructure	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An overnight Russian drone attack on Ternopil on Dec. 3 damaged energy infrastructure in the city, Mayor Serhiy Nadal said. Nadal added that part of Ternopil remains without power after a Russian drone struck an unspecified energy facility within the city. Emergency response worked are currently on-scene, and no casualties were immediately reported in the attack. Ternopil, a city in western Ukraine with a population of roughly 225,000 residents, lies hundreds of kilometers from the front line and is not a common target of Russian attacks. Despite its geographic positioning, in recent days the city has experienced multiple attack drone swarms as Russia continues to deploy thousands of drone each month on various region of the country. On Dec. 2, a Russian drone struck a high-rise building in the city, killing at least one person and injured three. The most recent attack comes as Russia continues to target energy infrastructure across the country with drone and missile attacks as it seeks to plunge Ukrainians into another harsh winter without adequate power and energy resources. In the most recent mass aerial attack on the country on Nov. 28, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; to the nation&apos;s power grid. In November, Russia launched a total of 347 missiles as well as over 2,500 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-drone-attack-on-ternopil-damages-energy-infrastructure/	2024-12-02T18:56:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ternopil.jpg
Zelensky disputes media reports of 80,000 Ukrainian military casualties	During an interview with Kyodo News published on Dec. 2, President Volodymyr Zelensky disputed reports in Western media that as many as 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed during the full-scale war with Russia. &quot;Recently, some in, I believe, the American press reported that 80,000 Ukrainian had been killed. I want to tell you that, no, (the number of those killed is) less, much less,&quot; Zelensky said, while refusing to provide the number of Ukrainians killed and wounded. &quot;However, we have to be honest, we do not know how many Ukrainian have been killed on occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comments likely refer to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s claims published on Sept. 17 that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the war, with a further 400,000 wounded. Following the Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting, Ukrainian lawmakers quickly disputed the claims with Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, telling Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the numbers were &quot;exaggerated.&quot; The lawmaker suggested that 50,000 soldiers killed could be an approximate figure, though he admitted he does not have the most accurate data and that even his number could be an overestimation. The Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting falls broadly in line with estimates published by the Economist on Nov. 26, claiming that between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, and 400,000 injured. Zelensky did not comment on the number of Ukrainian soldiers reportedly wounded in the war. Ukraine has largely avoided commenting on its losses, though President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. In turn, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces put Russian overall losses at nearly 744,000 as of Dec. 2, a total the includes those killed, wounded, missing, and captured. &#xA0;The losses Russia suffered in the full-scale war are believed to be greater than during all the wars since 1945 combined. Through open source research, journalists from Mediazona and BBC Russia, have identified the names of 80,973 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as of Nov. 29. &#xA0; The number of daily Russian casualties continues to reach record highs, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, with daily losses surpassing 2,000 for the first time on Nov. 29. Russia also suffered record losses in military equipment and personnel in November in the war against Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Dec. 1. Nearly 46,000 Russian soldiers had been lost over the past month, while an estimated $3 billion in weapons and equipment had been damaged or destroyed.	https://kyivindependent.com/estimates-of-ukraines-military-causalities-exaggerated-by-media-zelensky-claims/	2024-12-02T18:01:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
France, UK discuss deploying troops to Ukraine for ceasefire monitoring, sources tell RFE/RL	Paris and London are exploring options to support Ukraine in potential peace talks with Russia, including deploying French and U.K. troops to monitor a ceasefire along the contact line, a senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The official, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, noted that these discussions are happening in individual capitals, not within the formal NATO structure. The aim is to prepare for various scenarios, ensuring European countries are ready to assist Kyiv if the new U.S. administration requests greater European involvement. According to the official, the proposals also seek to secure European allies&apos; participation in peace talks that could be mediated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. French and British discussions on leading a military coalition in Ukraine have gained momentum, with Le Monde reporting renewed talks about deploying troops. French Foreign Minister Jean-No&#xEB;l Barrot told BBC News that while France is not currently planning to send troops into combat, the country &quot;does not discard any option.&quot; &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometer, the threat gets one square kilometer closer to Europe,&quot; Barrot said. The idea of sending Western troops to Ukraine resurfaced in February when French President Emmanuel Macron first raised the possibility. He revisited the topic in May, suggesting that if Russian forces breached Ukraine&#x2019;s front line and Kyiv requested assistance, France would have to seriously consider deploying troops. The debate over the role of Western military involvement in Ukraine highlights a broader divide among European leaders on how best to support Kyiv in the face of Russian aggression. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur stressed that Ukraine needs greater investment in its military production capabilities, not foreign troops on its battlefield.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-discuss-deploying-troops-to-ukraine-for-ceasefire-monitoring-sources-tell-rfe-rl/	2024-12-02T15:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2058321047.jpg
US announces $725 million military aid package for Ukraine	The United States will deliver a $725 million weapons package to Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Dec. 2. The move comes as President Joe Biden&apos;s administration, nearing the end of its term, works to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s defenses against Russian forces before the January transition of power. &quot;Today, I am announcing the delivery of $725 million in additional weapons and equipment for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&quot; Blinked wrote on X. &quot;The United States and more than 50 nations stand united with Ukraine.&quot; The package will include Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, drones, and landmines, among other equipment. This marks a significant increase in the use of the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which allows the U.S. to transfer weapons from existing stockpiles to allies in urgent situations. Previous PDA announcements have typically ranged between $125 million and $250 million, according to Reuters. With an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion in PDA funding still authorized by Congress, Biden is expected to allocate more aid to Ukraine before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The current package also includes land mines, marking the first time in decades that the U.S. has exported such devices. While more than 160 countries have banned land mines under an international treaty due to their risks to civilians, Kyiv has been requesting them since the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian forces have reportedly deployed land mines extensively along the front lines. The mines included in this assistance are described as &quot;non-persistent,&quot; designed with a limited power system that renders them non-lethal after a short period. Unlike older land mines that could remain dangerous for years, these devices are intended to mitigate long-term risks to civilians.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-725-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-12-02T13:33:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1877341976.jpg
Russia-friendly candidates surge in Romania's elections, a worrying signal for Ukraine	Romania&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections saw a strong showing for far-right politicians critical of military support for Ukraine. Anti-NATO and Russia-admiring independent candidate Calin Georgescu came in first during the initial round of the presidential vote on Nov. 24, with nearly 23%, a shock result that contradicted previous polling. Nationalist parties failed to win a majority in the Dec. 1 parliamentary elections but more than tripled the far-right presence in Romania&apos;s legislature. Though far from a full victory, such a political shift in a country whose government staunchly supported its Ukrainian neighbors underscores the growing fatigue across Europe. It also reveals how European voices critical of support for Ukraine are steadily leaving the fringe of political discourse. Georgescu, a conspiracy theory-loving politician who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and Romania&apos;s World War II-era pro-Nazi dictator Ion Antonescu, is expected to face pro-EU Elena Lasconi in the presidential runoff on Dec. 8. Initially considered a marginal candidate, conservative ultranationalist Georgescu owed his success to a strong social media presence that helped him capitalize on the anti-establishment votes. The first round, accompanied by accusations of TikTok&apos;s pro-Georgescu bias and Russian-linked cyberattacks, was even subjected to a recount and had to be validated by the Constitutional Court. In the parliamentary elections, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), whose leader George Simion has been banned from entering Ukraine, came second with more than 18% of the vote, trailing only the incumbent Social Democrats with 22.6%.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Two other far-right parties &#x2014; SOS Romania of pro-Russian MEP Diana Sosoaca and the Party of Young People (POT) associated with Georgescu &#x2014; won roughly 7.5% and 6.2%, respectively. While the pro-Western moderate parties gathered more votes in the parliamentary elections, the strong showing of nationalist parties and Georgescu&apos;s real chances of winning the presidency added another brick to the growing pro-Russian sentiment in Europe. Romania has proven itself to be a staunch ally to Ukraine, providing important military, economic, and humanitarian support. Sharing a 613-kilometer (380-mile) border with Ukraine, Romania has been threatened by Russian drones crashing on its territory during night raids on Ukraine. The country has been one of the few partners to provide Ukraine with a full Patriot air defense battery, atop a mostly classified list of materiel that reportedly includes APRA-40 multiple-launch rocket systems or TAB-71 armored vehicles. Ukrainian pilots are learning to fly F-16s at the allied training hub in the Fetesti Air Base in southeastern Romania, while another base is scheduled to host training for Ukrainian Marines. As Ukraine&apos;s neighbor, Romania became crucial for the transit of Ukrainian agricultural exports heading to global markets amid Russia&apos;s attempts at blocking the Black Sea trade routes. Though the importance of the Romanian route has decreased thanks to Ukraine reopening a new maritime corridor, Romania&apos;s Constanta Black Sea port still accounted for one-quarter of Ukrainian agricultural exports as of late 2024. As part of humanitarian assistance to the besieged country, Romania has hosted over 170,000 refugees and supported international demining efforts. Bucharest has also been a vocal advocate for Kyiv and its accession to NATO and the EU on the international stage. The cooperation between the two neighbors was solidified in a 10-year security treaty penned on July 11. &quot;We must stand by Ukraine and its people,&quot; outgoing Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the European Parliament in February, saying that defending democracy, territorial integrity, and sovereignty cannot be subjected to &quot;solidarity fatigue.&quot; Despite a surge, the Russian-friendly nationalist parties failed to win a majority in the parliament. However, Romania&apos;s political system gives the president ample opportunities to disrupt the country&apos;s pro-Ukraine course. Romania&apos;s head of state is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, chairs the Defense Council, and represents the country internationally, including in the European Council and at NATO summits. Georgescu has often weighed in on foreign and defense issues, calling a NATO base in the country a source of national &quot;shame&quot; and speaking out against military assistance for Kyiv. During the electoral campaign, the far-right candidate suggested there is no war in Ukraine, asking the moderator, &quot;Have you been there? Did you see it with your own eyes?&quot; He also praised Putin as a man who &quot;loves his country.&quot; If Georgescu wins the second sound of the presidential vote, &quot;he will have a popular legitimacy as a president&#x2026; (and) all the necessary discursive coverage,&quot; Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at the Babe&#x219;-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, told the Kyiv Independent. People protest in the front of the Palace of the Parliament at the Victory square in Bucharest, Romania, on Nov. 27, 2024, with banners reading &quot;democracy rather than fascism,&quot; after the surprise win of a far-right candidate in the first round of the country&apos;s presidential elections. (Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;He will be able to be everywhere, and he will change the mood of the country,&quot; he added. Nevertheless, presidential powers are constrained by parliamentary checks and balances, preventing the head of state from unilaterally shifting Bucharest&apos;s geopolitical orientation, Romanian foreign policy journalist Mihai Isac told the Kyiv Independent. However, the timing of the elections would give Georgescu one powerful tool to influence foreign policy &#x2014; appointing a preferred candidate as prime minister. If the parliament rejects the president&apos;s nominee twice in a row, the legislature can be dissolved, leading to snap elections, says Vlad Adamescu, co-founder of the Politica La Minut publication. Georgescu could, therefore, coerce the parties to shape a cabinet closer to his image or prompt snap elections that could potentially give the far right a chance to mobilize more support amid political instability. Combining his presidential authority and the visible far-right success in the elections, Georgescu &quot;could very well reorient Romania,&quot; Miscoiu concluded. &quot;We can reasonably believe that if elected, then there will be a change in Romania&apos;s position toward a much more neutral stance than today.&quot; The election results come amid the growing Kremlin-friendly sentiment in Europe, with Romania following the recent example of Slovakia that turned from being actively supportive of Ukraine to now being vastly pro-Russian. Yet, the growing support for radical groups is mainly attributed to Romania&apos;s economic challenges and dissatisfaction with the &quot;establishment&quot; parties rather than foreign policy issues. A part of Georgescu&apos;s appeal rested on his heavily spiritual and religion-laden messaging, gathering support among the predominantly Orthodox Christian population. &quot;In the last few years, there is a stable increase in Russian-inspired propaganda, which puts the Orthodox relation between Romania and Russia in the first place,&quot; Isac said. However, Georgescu and other far-right candidates also tapped into the growing fatigue with the war in Ukraine and the fears of being dragged into the conflict, mirroring the messaging of Kremlin-friendly politicians in Moldova or Georgia. A Globsec 2024 poll showed that the percentage of Romanians who blame Russia for the war dropped by 10 points to 55%, a development attributed by the researchers to the rise of anti-Ukrainian narratives online. &quot;The Romanian government and the Romanian president did not talk about what we are sending to Ukraine&#x2026; All the arms shipments that are happening &#x2014; and it&apos;s very good that they are happening &#x2014; are state secret,&quot; Adamescu said. &quot;And no one has explained why we need to do this, why this is in our national interest.&quot; Though Georgescu&apos;s voters may not be &quot;profoundly anti-Ukraine,&quot; they &quot;voted for an anti-Ukraine candidate because the (political) establishment is pro-Ukraine,&quot; said Razvan Petri, Adamescu&apos;s colleague at Politica La Minut. If Georgescu enters the presidential palace, he will join the small but budding coalition of Ukraine-skeptic voices in NATO and the EU, such as Hungary&apos;s Viktor Orban or Slovakia&apos;s Robert Fico. With Donald Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House in January, the idea of disengaging from Ukraine may no longer be considered fringe at a time when Kyiv needs support from its partners the most. &quot;It&apos;s reasonable to believe that if Romania switches position, then there will be some sort of a domino effect in the region and maybe also in the European Union,&quot; Miscoiu warned, naming neighboring Moldova as one of the countries that might feel the impact the most.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-friendly-candidates-surge-in-romanias-elections-a-worrying-signal-for-ukraine/	2024-12-02T13:31:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186337444.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Scholz visits Kyiv for first time since June 2022, pledges $680 million in military support	Key developments on Dec. 2: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Kyiv on Dec. 2 to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirm his country&apos;s support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. &quot;I would like to make it clear here on the ground that Germany will remain Ukraine&apos;s strongest supporter in Europe,&quot; Scholz said upon his arrival, promising additional arms supplies worth 650 million euros ($680 million) in December, N-TV reported. This marks Scholz&apos;s first visit to Ukraine&apos;s capital in two and a half years. The chancellor&apos;s arrival comes shortly after his controversial phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which drew criticism from Kyiv. Scholz previously visited Kyiv in June 2022 alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, marking the first visit by the three European leaders since the outbreak of the full-scale war. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor was nevertheless often criticized for cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Recently, Scholz criticized Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU party leader who will seek to unseat the chancellor in the February snap elections, for the latter&apos;s willingness to provide Taurus missiles to Ukraine. &quot;All I can say is: be careful! You don&apos;t play Russian roulette with Germany&apos;s security,&quot; Scholz said at his party conference in Berlin. Merz, whose party is currently leading in the polls, previously proposed issuing an ultimatum to Putin to end his aggression. Should the Russian leader refuse, Kyiv&apos;s partners would lift all restrictions on already provided weapons, and only then would Berlin approve the delivery of Taurus missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 2 new reshuffles in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky&apos;s statement follows General Mykhailo Drapatyi&apos;s appointment as Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces commander. When asked why Drapatyi has replaced Oleksandr Pavliuk, who has held the position since Feb. 11, 2024, Zelensky said the change is related to the recently presented resilience plan. Zelenksy&apos;s resilience plan, unveiled on Nov. 19, contains several reform proposals, including those in the defense sector. According to Zelensky, the decisions outlined in the plan are designed for &quot;particular individuals,&quot; so changes in the Ukrainian forces will continue. &quot;This is not the last (personnel) reshuffle. There will be more because we need to move faster,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv. Russian losses at the front increased significantly in the fall, while Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. In November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in combat operations. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army, according to the Defense Ministry. Despite that, Russian forces have taken over 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) in November alone, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Russian news outlet Agentstvo wrote on Nov. 25. Russia has trained 300,000 contract soldiers as reserves for the currently fighting regiments, a Russian official said in an article for the propaganda outlet Krasnaya Zvezda on Dec. 2. &quot;Seven companies of instructors and eight training companies for specialists... have trained over 300,000 service members,&quot; said Ivan Buvaltsev, the head of the training department of Russia&apos;s Armed Forces. The claim comes as Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east is picking up pace despite allegedly suffering record losses. Buvaltsev did not specify when the 300,000 reservists were supposedly trained, but the article&apos;s context suggests he refers to the year 2024. Former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu set up nine reserve battalions to train and prepare contract soldiers to offset Russia&apos;s casualties in Ukraine at the end of 2023. According to Shoigu, 335,000 people signed up voluntarily to fight in 2023. In 2024, this number was 200,000, according to former President Dmitry Medvedev. Russia reportedly suffered record losses in military equipment and personnel in the war against Ukraine in November. Moscow&apos;s losses steadily grew since the beginning of the fall as Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Only in November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in operations, Kyiv said. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army. November also saw the record for enemy personnel losses in one day broken: 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. As of Dec. 2, Russia lost 743,920 troops, 9,478 tanks, and 19,397 armored fighting vehicles, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The figures could not be independently verified. Some of the North Korean soldiers deployed to fight for Russia have already been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News on Dec. 1 without revealing their numbers. Pyongyang is said to have dispatched between 10,000-12,000 troops to aid Moscow&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Russia&apos;s western Kursk Oblast. Speaking to the Japanese news agency, Zelensky said that Russia is treating the first batch of North Korean soldiers well to attract tens of thousands more. Ukraine&apos;s head of state predicted that Pyongyang&apos;s forces would eventually be used as &quot;cannon fodder&quot; to decrease losses among the Russian military. He also warned of negative security impacts for Asia as Russia is teaching North Korean troops the methods of modern warfare, including drone use. Separately, a Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson told the media that 2,000 North Korean troops have been assigned to Russia&apos;s marine and airborne units fighting on the front. &quot;If they (North Korean troops) have joined units engaged in active hostilities, then we can confidently say that they have joined the fight,&quot; spokesperson Andrii Cherniak told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, adding that this might not necessarily mean deployment on front-line positions. &quot;Maybe they are not in advanced positions, but they enable aggression against Ukraine, ensure the killing of Ukrainian service members.&quot; North Korea is Russia&apos;s leading ally in its war against Ukraine, reportedly providing Moscow with over 100 ballistic missiles and 5 million artillery shells. In exchange, Pyongyang is believed to receive economic support and assistance for its nuclear weapons program. Ukraine might have to liberate some Russian-held territories through diplomatic means after the country&apos;s NATO membership becomes certain, Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News on Dec. 1. &quot;Our army lacks the strength to do that. That is true,&quot; Zelensky told the Japanese news agency regarding the liberation of territories held by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. &quot;We do have to find diplomatic solutions,&quot; he said, adding that liberation by force could be considered when Ukraine is strong enough to prevent new aggression by Russia. The statement aligns with a recent rhetoric shift in Kyiv as Moscow&apos;s forces keep advancing in the east, and the future of Western support is uncertain under Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming presidency. Zelensky had long been adamant about Ukraine&apos;s full territorial integrity as a key cornerstone of any peace deal. His more recent comments show a willingness to defer the status of occupied territories in exchange for entry into NATO while not recognizing Russian occupation as legitimate. &quot;We understand that Article 5, when you&apos;re a member of NATO, cannot apply to the entire territory of Ukraine during wartime, as countries are against the risks of being drawn into the war,&quot; Zelensky told Sky News last week. The comments came as Ukraine has been urging NATO allies to invite Ukraine to join the alliance as early as next week during the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4. Speaking to Kyodo News, Zelensky said that the war has entered a &quot;complicated period&quot; and that the current level of international support is not sufficient. &#xA0;He reiterated his calls on NATO to launch talks with Kyiv as soon as possible. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also commented on Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, saying that the president-elect&apos;s team is studying Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan. &quot;But there will be no capitulation from the side of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump&apos;s presidency has sparked fears that Washington would pull the plug on Ukraine as the president-elect has criticized military aid for Kyiv. He has also pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table, with some reports suggesting this plan could entail freezing the war along the current front lines and postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-scholz-visits-kyiv-for-first-time-since-june-2022-pledges-680-million-in-military-support/	2024-12-02T12:55:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187354722.jpg
‘Destroying us little by little:’ Ukrainian troops worried about fate of Kursk operation	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first name only. Nearly four months after Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, some Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly pessimistic about the costly operation. &#x201C;Aviation is a key factor, and (Russian troops) are throwing all the aerial bombs every night, destroying us little by little,&#x201D; said Ukrainian serviceman Oleksii with the 80th Air Assault Brigade that is currently deployed in Kursk Oblast. When Ukrainian forces unexpectedly opened a new front in the northeast in August by breaking through Kursk Oblast, it was a significant morale-boosting moment for the country. Ukraine continued to advance forward day by day, shocking even Western allies with the stunning operation, despite being severely outgunned and outmanned across the front. While unable to quickly prevent a deepening Ukrainian advance, Russian forces eventually began to counterattack in September to push the Ukrainians out. Military analysts say that there have been three waves thus far, with an upcoming one expected in December. Nearly 60,000 Russian troops are deployed in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported on Nov. 22, citing an undisclosed General Staff source. The Kursk operation &#x2014; the first time Russia was invaded by another country&#x2019;s army since World War II &#x2014; kicked off three months before uncertain U.S. presidential elections. Ukraine&apos;s grip on Russian territory has given it leverage in potential negotiations. But that grip is weakening. Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing Kyiv&apos;s senior military source, that Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian military man drives on car in Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Russia on Sep. 23, 2024. (Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russia could begin a larger push in December in an attempt to reclaim the entirety of Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump enters office in January 2025, according to Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian military and political analyst with the Kyiv-based think tank Information Resistance. Trump has claimed to end the war swiftly in a deal &#x201C;that&#x2019;s good for both sides,&#x201D; leveraging what he described as &#x201C;a very good relationship&#x201D; with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A policy document envisages the new administration pushing Russia and Ukraine to enter peace talks by threatening to either halt or ramp up U.S. military aid to Kyiv should either side refuse, the Guardian reported on Nov. 28. Meanwhile, Russia continues to gain ground across the front, particularly in the eastern Donbas region, as talks of freezing the front line surface with Trump&#x2019;s return to power. The Ukrainian military leadership has claimed the operation had forced Moscow to pull forces to its southern region and alleviated stress for Kyiv in Donbas. But Russia managed to capture over 1,600 square kilometers (roughly the size of London) of Donbas territories between September and November, despite &quot;spending significant amounts of men and material in the process,&#x201D; according to the Finland-based open-source analytical organization Black Bird Group. The estimated Russian gains in Donbas over the fall surpass the territories Ukraine held in Kursk Oblast at its peak, which the senior Ukrainian military official told Reuters was roughly 1,380 square kilometers. Ukraine currently controls about 800 square kilometers (roughly the size of the city of Chicago), the source told Reuters in late November. A map of the front line in Kursk Oblast as of late November. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Strategic value?As the front line in Kursk Oblast more or less stabilizes and the Ukrainians are once again back on the defensive, more soldiers &#x2014; many of whom said their units took heavy losses in the area &#x2014; are beginning to question the incursion. Kyiv has allocated substantial resources for the operation, which is also supported by Western long-range striking capabilities, to hold the lands at any cost. President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the Kursk operation, reiterating how it enabled Ukraine to return &quot;a significant number&quot; of Ukrainians from Russian captivity and prevent a re-occupation of bordering Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts. &quot;Instead of a buffer zone on the territory of Ukraine, which the Russians planned, we have created a buffer zone near our border on Russian territory,&#x201D; Zelensky said during an October evening address. Observing how Russian troops were advancing quicker in Donetsk Oblast from the distance, the Ukrainian soldiers stressed that the elite Ukrainian units deployed to invade Russia could have instead been used to hold the eastern front. &#x201C;Not one soldier whom I speak with understands why we are here (in Kursk Oblast),&#x201D; Oleksii said, adding that many guys from his unit refused to be deployed in the Kursk operation and went home. Other soldiers, including another serviceman from the elite 80th brigade, Illia, suggested that the Kursk incursion would likely be destined for a short life and that it was probably a Ukrainian attempt to distract the public from the worsening situation in Donbas. &#x201C;I&apos;m 100% sure they&apos;ll force us out of Kursk, it&apos;s just a matter of time,&#x201D; Illia told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It&apos;s a pity that people are dying for PR.&#x201D; Western and Ukrainian military experts are divided on the operation&apos;s strategic value, but they stressed that Russian troops would have advanced on the eastern front regardless of the Kursk operation. Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Black Bird Group analyzing the war closely through open source, said that there appear to be &#x201C;more negatives&#x201D; in the operation, with Ukraine prioritizing the operation &#x201C;pretty high&#x201D; despite the deteriorating Donbas situation. Experts have said that the operation&apos;s pros included Ukraine bringing the war to Russian territory and enhancing the protection of bordering areas in Ukraine&#x2019;s northern Sumy, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv oblasts. The operation has also forced Russia to divert some troops that could have been deployed elsewhere to its own Kursk Oblast and suffer a high cost to reclaim the territories. Ukraine claimed in late October that Russia had lost over 17,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast since August. Soldiers are seen near a military vehicle in the village of Khotin, Ukraine on Sept. 13, 2024. (Andre Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images)A view of damage in the village of Khotin, Ukraine, on Sept. 13, 2024. (Andre Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images)The recent deployment of North Korean soldiers to the area as reserves signals that Moscow is also suffering personnel shortfalls, Kovalenko from the Kyiv-based think tank Information Resistance said. According to Western and Ukrainian government estimates, Russia has already deployed 10,000 to 11,000 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. Russian troops are currently unleashing the heaviest offensive from the western direction from the village of Lyubimovka along the Snagost River in the Kursk region to the west of the Ukrainian stronghold, according to Kovalenko. &#x201C;(Russian troops) are trying to put pressure from the west to the east,&#x201D; Kovalenko said, adding that the Snagost used to be Ukraine&#x2019;s geographical barrier until Russians toppled over the area in October. Ukrainian soldiers on the ground said that Russia continues to attack in small groups supported by equipment and swarms of deadly first-person-view drones. It is unclear how long Ukraine can realistically occupy the patch of Russian territory. Among the struggles that Ukrainian troops face include the apparent lack of high-quality fortifications, at least in large amounts, and good defensive terrain, according to Kastehelmi from the Black Bird Group. And as Ukraine loses more territory in Kursk Oblast, it would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to maneuver and easier for Russian troops to observe movements in the Ukrainian-controlled areas, he added. &#x201C;There are issues, but at least it seems to be a bit more stabilized than it was earlier in the, in the autumn when the Russians struck the Ukrainians back more quickly,&#x201D; he assessed. The fate of the Russian region would largely depend on whether Moscow prioritizes the Kursk operation, as Russia is not facing a threat from Ukraine holding onto these areas from a military point of view, he explained. &#x201C;The Ukrainians don&apos;t really control anything that important in terms of, for example, cities or areas, and they aren&apos;t really threatening (Russia with) anything important by holding this area,&#x201D; he said, adding that the situation has become &#x201C;increasingly political&#x201D; for Moscow. The recent Western permission to strike into Russia with long-range weaponry paved the way for Kyiv to hit military targets from afar. Multiple Western media reports about the Ukrainian strikes using U.S.-made long-range ATACMS and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles in Russian bordering regions. The Russian Defense Ministry on Nov. 26 admitted that Ukraine hit a Russian S-400 air defense system and an airfield in embattled Kursk Oblast with U.S.-provided ATACMS.

(Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images)The soldiers on the ground said that they had not felt the results of these long-range strikes on the battlefield. Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, said that the long-range strikes &#x201C;help a lot&#x201D; in the defense of Kursk Oblast. The warehouse of the 67th arsenal of Russia&apos;s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate in Bryansk Oblast that Ukraine claims to have struck with ATACMS equipped the Kursk Grouping of Russian forces. Neutralizing the ammunition stockpiles allowed Ukraine to slow down the pace of the Russian offensive and could disrupt Moscow&#x2019;s plans, the expert stressed. &#x201C;This means that we have lowered their fighting capacity,&#x201D; he said, continuing: &#x201C;They understand they already can&#x2019;t count on this warehouse and that they must rearrange again, make adjustments, and make their plans from new calculations.&#x201D; But while destroying Russian military components that could be used against Ukraine is helpful, &#x201C;the effect is still probably rather limited as Ukrainian missile stocks are also limited,&#x201D; Kastelmi said. Low stocks don&#x2019;t allow Ukraine to conduct a large-scale strike campaign targeting a substantial number of headquarters, ammunition depots, training centers, and logistical hubs to &#x201C;paralyze the whole system,&#x201D; according to Kastelmi. &#x201C;Because the permission to shoot the missiles on the Russian soil like was given so late and missile stocks are limited, it really means that it&apos;s a nice bonus, but it won&apos;t change the larger dynamics of the battle,&#x201D; he added. The critical components would instead be manpower, quality of troops, and the availability of equipment, drones, and artillery, according to Kastelmi. &#x201C;A bunch of combat-ready units are being wiped out (by Russian forces),&#x201D; Illia, the soldier from the 80th brigade deployed in Kursk Oblast, said, stressing how exhausted his guys were. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that I don&#x2019;t know something or don&#x2019;t understand something, but it&#x2019;s sh*t.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/destroying-us-little-by-little-ukrainian-troops-worry-fate-of-kursk-operation/	2024-12-02T12:51:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2175025641.jpg
The EU will invest 400 million euros this year, 1.9 billion euros next year into Ukraine's defense industry, EU top diplomat Kallas says	With the fate of further U.S. support for Ukraine, and thereby the future of the country, up in the air as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, the EU wants to send the message to Kyiv that it has its back. Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s new top diplomat, was in Kyiv on her first day in office on Dec. 1. In an exclusive interview, Kallas told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the EU is the biggest investor in the Ukrainian defense industry.&quot; &quot;So 400 million euros this year, 1.9 billion euros next year. This is definitely something that&apos;s going to boost the defense industry in Ukraine with the help of the EU,&quot; said Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister turned high representative for EU&apos;s foreign affairs. Talking to the Kyiv Independent after a long first day in office, and less than an hour before leaving the country, she focused on three main topics &#x2014; doing more to support Ukraine militarily and economically, showing the U.S. that supporting Kyiv is in its best interest, and bleeding out Russia&apos;s economy to make sure that when the time for negotiations comes, Moscow doesn&apos;t have the means to continue its war. Kallas&apos; visit, together with that of new European Council President Antonio Costa, was a sign that, at least for now, the EU will attempt to keep Ukraine&apos;s economy and military industry in shape. &quot;I think the investments into the Ukrainian defense industry are very, very welcome because these things are produced here and immediately used as well,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;We are thinking about different initiatives, how we can support and help Ukraine,&quot; she added. In the first public mention of the figure, Kallas said Ukraine had finally received the 1 million shells from the EU, which were badly needed and long overdue. For a just and lasting peace, for Ukraine, together in a united Europe.@antoniolscosta @kajakallas pic.twitter.com/f9dnSPRl2a &quot;Yes, this 1 million rounds of shells have been delivered, but of course, as we know here, it&apos;s not enough, more needs to be done,&quot; Kallas acknowledged. For comparison, Russian factories could produce or refurbish 4.5 million 152 mm shells in 2024, according to a Spring report by Sky News. With the change in EU leadership chewing up the last months of 2024 and the election campaign in Europe&apos;s biggest economy, Germany, set to take up the first few months of 2025, Kallas was not ready to discuss European production in the upcoming year. &quot;There is no actual number yet,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to really speed up the process of producing more.&quot; &quot;There is the political will to do it.&quot; Kallas gave a sneak peek at Europe&#x2019;s strategy going forward &#x2014; making sanctions against Moscow more effective and using Russian Central Bank assets frozen in the West to keep Ukraine afloat. &quot;First, in March, the criminalization of circumvention of sanctions will enter into force,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;I think this is a good thing. And a signal to everybody not to circumvent sanctions. But there is so much more we have to do to make sure that the sanctions are really followed,&quot; she added. &quot;What I want to stress is that we also see the sanctions working, but if we concentrate all our efforts on implementing the sanctions properly, we could achieve more results, which is weakening Russia,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;We see their economy in a very dire state.&quot; The Russian economy has in fact experienced several challenges over the past few months, with a record-high interest rate unable to stop the accelerating inflation, set to hit around 10% in 2024. The U.S. government&apos;s Nov. 21 decision to impose new sanctions on dozens of Russian banks has added insult to injury for the country&apos;s economy, with the value of the Russian ruble dropping over 10% within a week, hitting an exchange rate of 113 rubles per $1. &quot;If you think about the interest rate of the Russian bank, it&apos;s 21%. Their national fund is completely depleted. They can&apos;t get the revenues from the gas that they used to get. And they have a very difficult situation with the employment market because everything is going to the military industry,&quot; Kallas said. In 2025, Russia will spend around 40% of its budget on the country&#x2019;s defense sector. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t overestimate the power of Russia. We should not underestimate our own power,&#x201D; Kallas said, referring to the fact that the EU, with an economy eight times larger than that of Russia, must approach Moscow from the position of strength. While in Kyiv, European Council President Costa assured that the EU would continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and military assistance to Ukraine, including 4.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) to support the Ukrainian budget by the end of the year. In 2025, the EU will transfer 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to Ukraine monthly, obtained from profits received from the frozen Russian assets. Costa said those funds can be used for military needs. &quot;We also need to discuss how we can proceed with the use of frozen assets because it&apos;s clear that we have the Russian frozen assets, and it&apos;s clear that Russia is causing all the damages to Ukraine, so it should be also Russia that pays for those damages,&quot; Kallas echoed Costa&apos;s earlier remarks. At multiple points throughout the interview, Kallas mentioned that the EU has been pulling its weight in supporting Ukraine. However, maintaining the current level of support Kyiv is enjoying in case the U.S. decreases its commitments seems hard to achieve. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s challenging, it&apos;s clear,&quot; she said. European officials are now attempting to make a case for the U.S. support to continue. &quot;The EU has been the biggest supporter of Ukraine, and we intend to be so. We also intend to talk to our American allies about why it&apos;s in their interest to also invest in Ukraine&apos;s security,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;Ukraine aid is not charity, it&apos;s an investment into our own security, and in the interest of the U.S. If we look at the bigger picture, we see North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia working together. We see the North Korean soldiers now also recruited by Russia in the fight in Ukraine,&#x201D; she added. &quot;So if the U.S. is concerned about emboldening China, then they should first also deal with Russia because, in all the places, Russia is their biggest adversary.&quot; Kallas is adamant that it&#x2019;s &#x201C;up to Ukraine to decide&#x201D; when to hold peace talks, which President-elect Trump&#x2019;s incoming team appears eager to initiate. &quot;Right now, it is our obligation to support Ukraine so that it can strengthen its position on the battlefield,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;The stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger Ukraine is around the negotiation table.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-eu-will-invest-400-million-euros-this-year-1-9-billion-euros-next-year-into-ukraines-defense-industry-eu-top-diplomat-kallas-tells-kyiv-independent/	2024-12-02T12:32:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160829296.jpg
Russian presidential administration holds seminar for regional officials to discuss 'victory's image' in war	Russian presidential administration last week held a seminar for vice-governors to discuss an &quot;image of victory&quot; in the war against Ukraine, the Russian pro-regime Kommersant news outlet reported on Dec. 2, citing its undisclosed source. The news comes as Western media report that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is exploring the possibility of freezing the war between Ukraine and Russia on the current front lines. Given the territory currently occupied by Moscow and potential military threats from Russian in the future, Kyiv publicly opposes such a move. The Kremlin held the seminar because Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will &quot;end,&quot; and &quot;it is necessary to be prepared for it,&quot; the source told Kommersant. The future results of the war must be seen as &quot;a victory&quot; in society, although different social groups perceive it differently, the source added. Therefore, officials need to focus on the &quot;quiet majority&quot; that will be &quot;satisfied with the achievement of the war&apos;s goals and the retention of the Russian-occupied territories,&quot; as advised by the presidential administration. During the seminar, the vice-governors were also told about the importance of working with public opinion regarding Russian military personnel returning from Ukraine. The presidential administration recommended that rehabilitation and employment of military personnel &quot;be kept in focus&quot; so that former soldiers &quot;do not join protest movements or criminals.&quot; The risk is that former soldiers will find it hard to find the same salaries in civilian life, the source said. Thus, authorities must consider encouraging them and fostering respectful attitudes toward them in society. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested ending the &quot;hot phase of the war&quot; by offering NATO membership to Ukrainian territory under government control. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-presidential-administration-holds-seminar-for-regional-officials-to-discuss-victorys-image-in-war/	2024-12-02T11:57:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
We need to move faster,' Zelensky announces personnel changes in Ukrainian Armed Forces	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 2 new reshuffles in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky&apos;s statement follows General Mykhailo Drapatyi&apos;s appointment as Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces commander. When asked why Drapatyi has replaced Oleksandr Pavliuk, who has held the position since Feb. 11, 2024, Zelensky said the change is related to the recently presented resilience plan. Zelenksy&apos;s resilience plan, unveiled on Nov. 19, contains several reform proposals, including those in the defense sector. According to Zelensky, the decisions outlined in the plan are designed for &quot;particular individuals,&quot; so changes in the Ukrainian forces will continue. &quot;This is not the last (personnel) reshuffle. There will be more because we need to move faster,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv. Russian losses at the front increased significantly in the fall, while Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. In November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in combat operations. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army, according to the Defense Ministry. Despite that, Russian forces have taken over 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) in November alone, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Russian news outlet Agentstvo wrote on Nov. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-to-move-faster-zelensky-announces-personnel-changes-in-ukrainian-armed-forces/	2024-12-02T10:27:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
This does not strengthen Ukraine,' Zelensky on Scholz's call with Putin	Separate talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin do not strengthen Ukraine and may lead to improving his standing, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 2 during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. &quot;In Europe, it may happen that after one call, there may be a second, third, fourth, fifth... Because sometimes leaders want to (wrestle for) leadership. After that, there may be a wave of actual recognition of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I believe that this does not strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky reiterated that he did not support Scholz&apos;s decision to call Putin. Meanwhile, the president added that Ukraine and Germany &quot;have more in common than differences.&quot; Scholz said that during his last call with Putin, he noted that Ukraine &quot;has the right to be an independent sovereign nation that decides whether it wants to be part of the European Union.&quot; Scholz called on Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine, to which the Russian president disagreed. &quot;Let the Russian president not expect to have Ukraine alone. We are ready to support Ukraine to the extent necessary. In the current situation. I think this is a very important message,&quot; Scholz said. &quot;Ukraine will be an independent state and will remain so,&quot; he added. Zelensky previously warned that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/sholz/	2024-12-02T09:38:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187354722.jpg
We shouldn't overestimate Russia's power, EU top diplomat Kallas says	In an exclusive interview with the Kyiv Independent, Kaja Kallas, the newly appointed vice-president of the European Commission and top EU diplomat, discusses Ukraine support and recent EU sanctions against Russia.

Szijjarto meets Lavrov in Moscow, calls on Ukraine, Russia to sit down at 'negotiating table'	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Ukraine and Russia to sit down &quot;at the negotiating table&quot; during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Dec. 2. Szijjarto has repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. &quot;The past thousand days have proven conclusively that the war in Ukraine cannot be resolved on the battlefield, and therefore the solution must be sought at the negotiating table,&quot; Szijjarto wrote on his Facebook. Severance of diplomatic relations makes a negotiated solution impossible, the Hungarian minister added. The Russian minister mentioned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s recent so-called &quot;peace mission,&#x201D; which sparked outrage across the European Union, with Brussels stressed that the venture had in no way represented the bloc. Under Orban&apos;s leadership, Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. Since taking the presidency of the European Commission in July, Orban has lobbied aggressively to stand as a negotiator between Ukraine and Russia. Orban previously dismissed Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, which calls for more long-range weapons and the permission to use them against Russian targets, as &quot;dangerous.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/szijjarto-meets-lavrov-in-moscow-calls-on-ukraine-russia-to-sit-down-at-negotiating-table/	2024-12-02T08:18:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/468959470_1104088491184443_9073209146401801951_n.jpg
Russia trained 300,000 reserve soldiers for war in Ukraine, Russian Defense Ministry claims	Russia has trained 300,000 contract soldiers as reserves for the currently fighting regiments, a Russian official told propaganda outlet Krasnaya Zvezda on Dec. 2. &quot;Seven companies of instructors and eight training companies for specialists... have trained over 300,000 service members,&quot; said Ivan Buvaltsev, the head of the training department of Russia&apos;s Armed Forces. The claim comes as Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east is picking up pace despite allegedly suffering record losses. Buvaltsev did not specify when the 300,000 reservists were supposedly trained, but the article&apos;s context suggests he refers to 2024. Former Defense Minister Seiger Shoigu set up nine reserve battalions to train and prepare contract soldiers to offset Russia&#x2019;s casualties in Ukraine at the end of 2023. According to Shoigu, 335,000 people signed up voluntarily to fight in 2023. In 2024, this number was 200,000, according to former President Dmitry Medvedev. Russia reportedly suffered record losses in military equipment and personnel in the war against Ukraine in November. Moscow&apos;s losses steadily grew since the beginning of the fall as Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Only in November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in operations, Kyiv said. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army. November also saw the record for enemy personnel losses in one day broken: 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. As of Dec. 2, Russia lost 743,920 troops, 9,478 tanks, and 19,397 armored fighting vehicles, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The figures could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trained-300-000-reserve-soldiers-for-war-in-ukraine-defense-ministry-claims/	2024-12-02T06:01:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Russia fired at least 60 North Korean missiles against Ukraine, military intelligence says	Russia has fired at least 60 North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a Ukrainian military spokesperson told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Dec. 2. North Korea supplied Russia with ammunition, ballistic missiles, and now soldiers since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Pyongyang has ratcheted up its support for Russia following Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s signing of a mutual defense pact with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Earlier reports mentioned more than 5 million artillery shells and 100 short-range ballistic missiles, including short-range ballistic missiles of the KN-23/24 type, supplied to Russia. &quot;Their accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,&quot; Andrii Cherniak, a military intelligence spokesperson, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. On top of ammunition and missiles, since late October, thousands of North Korean troops have been fighting in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast to expel Ukrainian forces holding approximately 800 square kilometers (309 square miles) of Russian territory. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, they suffered their first losses. Pyongyang is believed to receive economic support and assistance for its nuclear weapons program in return for troops and arms supplies.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-fired-at-least-60-north-korean-missiles-against-ukraine-military-intelligence-says/	2024-12-02T04:37:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166581524.jpg
Zelensky, Scholz meet in Kyiv as Germany unveils military aid	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Dec. 2, together paying respect to Ukrainian soldiers killed during the war with Russia. Scholz visited Ukraine&apos;s capital for the first time since June 2022, promising 650 million euros ($680 million) worth of arms to be supplied this December. A German Defense Ministry spokesperson clarified that this will be part of a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) package already announced in October. It includes two ISIR-T air defense systems, armored vehicles, attack drones, 10 Leopard 1 tanks, winter equipment, and generators, spokesperson Mitko Muller told Ukrainian media. The imminent delivery of the two IRIS-T systems &#x2013; one medium-range and one short-range &#x2013; was previously announced by a German military officer in November. The chancellor&apos;s arrival comes shortly after his controversial phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which drew criticism from Kyiv. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor was nevertheless often criticized for cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Recently, Scholz criticized Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU party leader who will seek to unseat the chancellor in the February snap elections, for the latter&apos;s willingness to provide Taurus missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-scholz-meet-in-kyiv/	2024-12-02T04:23:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Scholz-Zelensky.jpg
Kyiv denounces violence against Georgian protesters; Moscow compares pro-EU rally to Orange Revolution	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry condemned on Dec. 2 the violent crackdown by Georgian authorities against pro-EU protesters, saying the government&apos;s steps demonstrate a &quot;turn toward Moscow.&quot; At the same time, the Kremlin said that the protests bear similarities to Ukraine&apos;s Orange Revolution from 2004-05, calling the rally an attempt to &quot;destabilize the situation&quot; in the South Caucasus country. The latest wave of protests against the ruling Georgian Dream party broke out last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the suspension of the South Caucasus&apos; EU accession process until at least 2028. Over 220 people were arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons. Georgian Dream, which declared victory in the October elections broadly disputed by domestic opposition and international observers, has been accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. &quot;The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the ongoing violations of human rights and the use of force against peaceful protesters in Georgia,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. &quot;The efforts of the Georgian authorities to show that the country&apos;s European integration continues are surprising, as its actions indicate Georgia&apos;s turn towards Moscow.&quot; The ministry noted that Ukrainian politicians who sought to divert the country&apos;s pro-EU course also talked about merely &quot;suspending&quot; European integration. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also drew historical comparisons, saying the protests &quot;carry all the signs of an attempt to carry out an &apos;orange revolution.&apos;&quot; &quot;There is an attempt to destabilize the situation. We have seen similar events in a number of countries. The most direct parallel that can be drawn is the events of the &apos;Maidan&apos; in Ukraine,&quot; Peskov said, adding that the protests are Georgia&apos;s &quot;internal affair.&quot; Ukraine saw two major revolutions this century. The Orange Revolution was launched in 2004-05 over the falsification of presidential elections in favor of pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych. The 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution broke out after President Yanukovych, elected in 2010, decided not to sign an association agreement with the EU. In the wake of the revolution, Yanukovych fled the country, opening the path for Kyiv&apos;s westward direction. Georgia&apos;s ruling party has repeatedly warned of an attempt by domestic opposition to &quot;replicate&quot; the EuroMaidan Revolution in the country. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry called upon the Georgian Dream government to refrain from involving Ukraine in its internal matters, adding that Georgia should be more wary of a &quot;Belarusian scenario&quot; rather than a Ukrainian one. &quot;Ukraine was and remains in favor of democratic transformation in Georgia and its further European and Euro-Atlantic integration, which corresponds to the interests of the Georgian people,&quot; the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-react-to-georgian-protests/	2024-12-02T04:01:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186710736.jpg
Poland shuts down Druzhba pipeline section after oil leak	Supply to customers was not affected by a leak on one of the branching pipes of the Russian Druzhba pipeline in Poland, the Polish operator Pern said in a statement on Dec. 1. The communist-era-built Druzhba pipeline was used to transport oil from Russia to Europe through its two main branches, supplying central Europe through its southern pipeline and northern Europe through the northern pipeline. Poland has not imported Russian pipeline oil since early 2023. Druzhba&apos;s northern pipeline now mainly transfers oil arriving at its port of Gdansk, supplying Kazakh crude to Germany. A leak in one of Poland&#x2019;s pipes on the northern branch caused its operator, Pern, to halt deliveries and reroute the supply earmarked to Germany. The leak did not affect the quantity of the supply as the second branch&apos;s &quot;technical capabilities fully cover the volume needs of customers,&quot; the operator said in its statement. The cause of the leak is unknown and will be investigated, the statement added. The EU has banned imports of Russian pipeline oil in response to Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with only Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary granted exemptions due to their dependence on Russian supplies. Russian oil continues to transit to Czechia through Poland via the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-shuts-down-druzhba-pipeline-section-after-oil-leak/	2024-12-02T03:02:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1401409508.jpg
Georgian opposition leader briefly detained amid crackdown on pro-EU rally	Georgian police stepped in with beatings against the pro-EU protests in Tbilisi ongoing for the fourth day on Dec. 2, forcibly dispersing the protesters. The latest wave of protests against the ruling Georgian Dream party broke out last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the suspension of the South Caucasus&apos; EU accession process until at least 2028. Over 220 people were detained over the past few days, the country&apos;s Interior Ministry said. This included several journalists and Zurab Japaridze, one of the leaders of the opposition Coalition for Change, who was detained on Dec. 2 before being released the same day. Georgian Dream, which declared victory in the October elections broadly disputed by domestic opposition and international observers, has been accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. Tens of thousands have joined the demonstrations, with the police attempting to disperse the rally with teargas, water cannons, and arrests. In turn, the protesters have set up barricades and shot fireworks toward the riot police. Dozens have been injured during the crackdown, including journalists covering the rally. Pro-EU President Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of Georgian Dream who joined the protests, said that the &quot;majority of the arrested protesters have injuries to their heads and faces, broken face bones, eye sockets, open wounds.&quot; Thirty-seven people have been hospitalized on Dec. 2, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Georgian authorities claimed that 113 police officers have been injured since Nov. 28, including 21 between Dec. 1 and Dec. 2. The prime minister thanked law enforcement services for preventing a &quot;Maidan&quot; from taking place in Georgia. This was a reference to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014-2014, where mass pro-EU demonstrations led to the ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-protests-crackdown/	2024-12-02T02:30:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186705992.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 4, injure 23 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least four people and injured 23 across multiple regions, authorities reported on Dec. 2. Russian forces launched 110 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Fifty-two were shot down, 50 were lost across Ukraine thanks to electronic warfare countermeasures, and six flew to Belarus and Russia, according to the statement. A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil, killing at least one person and injuring four, officials said. Around 100 people were evacuated from the damaged building. The blast also damaged windows of the surrounding buildings, a school, and 20 cars. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 60-year-old man was injured during Russian attacks against Nikopol and the Marhanets community, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured five people, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two injuries were reported in the town of Pokrovsk, two in the village of Shevchenko, and one in the Andriivka village. In Kherson Oblast, three people were killed and 13 injured in Russian attacks over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. The three fatalities and 11 injuries were reported after Russian forces struck a minibus in the city of Kherson on Dec. 1. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Luhansk, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-108/	2024-12-02T01:35:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Ternopil.jpg
Some North Korean troops fighting on Russia's side killed, Zelensky says	Some of the North Korean soldiers deployed to fight for Russia have already been killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News on Dec. 1 without revealing their numbers. Pyongyang is said to have dispatched between 10,000-12,000 troops to aid Moscow&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Russia&apos;s western Kursk Oblast. Speaking to the Japanese news agency, Zelensky said that Russia is treating the first batch of North Korean soldiers well to attract tens of thousands more. Ukraine&apos;s head of state predicted that Pyongyang&apos;s forces would eventually be used as &quot;cannon fodder&quot; to decrease losses among the Russian military. He also warned of negative security impacts for Asia as Russia is teaching North Korean troops the methods of modern warfare, including drone use. Separately, a Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson told the media that 2,000 North Korean troops have been assigned to Russia&apos;s Marine brigade and an airborne division. &quot;If they (North Korean troops) have joined units engaged in active hostilities, then we can confidently say that they have joined the fight,&quot; spokesperson Andrii Cherniak told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, adding that this might not necessarily mean deployment on front-line positions. &quot;Maybe they are not in advanced positions, but they enable aggression against Ukraine, ensure the killing of Ukrainian service members.&quot; North Korea is Russia&apos;s leading ally in its war against Ukraine, reportedly providing Moscow with over 100 ballistic missiles and 5 million artillery shells. In exchange, Pyongyang is believed to receive economic support and assistance for its nuclear weapons program.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-north-korean-soldiers/	2024-12-02T01:02:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Ukraine's military lacks strength to retake some occupied territories, diplomacy needed, Zelensky says	Ukraine might have to liberate some Russian-held territories through diplomatic means after the country&apos;s NATO membership becomes certain, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News on Dec. 1. &quot;Our army lacks the strength to do that. That is true,&quot; Zelensky told the Japanese news agency regarding the liberation of territories held by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. &quot;We do have to find diplomatic solutions,&quot; he said, adding that liberation by force could be considered when Ukraine is strong enough to prevent new aggression by Russia. The statement aligns with a recent rhetoric shift in Kyiv as Moscow&apos;s forces keep advancing in the east, and the future of Western support is uncertain under Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming presidency. Zelensky had long been adamant about Ukraine&apos;s full territorial integrity as a key cornerstone of any peace deal. His more recent comments show a willingness to defer the status of occupied territories in exchange for entry into NATO while not recognizing Russian occupation as legitimate. &quot;We understand that Article 5, when you&apos;re a member of NATO, cannot apply to the entire territory of Ukraine during wartime, as countries are against the risks of being drawn into the war,&quot; Zelensky told Sky News last week. The comments came as Ukraine has been urging NATO allies to invite Ukraine to join the alliance as early as next week during the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4. Speaking to Kyodo News, Zelensky said that the war has entered a &quot;complicated period&quot; and that the current level of international support is not sufficient. &#xA0;He reiterated his calls on NATO to launch talks with Kyiv as soon as possible. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also commented on Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, saying that the president-elect&apos;s team is studying Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan. &quot;But there will be no capitulation from the side of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump&apos;s presidency has sparked fears that Washington would pull the plug on Ukraine as the president-elect has criticized military aid for Kyiv. He has also pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table, with some reports suggesting this plan could entail freezing the war along the current front lines and postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-liberate-territories/	2024-12-02T00:39:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Romania's ruling social democrats on course for most votes, far-right comes in second, preliminary results show	Romania&#x2019;s ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) received 22.5% of the votes during the Dec. 1 parliamentary elections, according to results from more than 99% polling stations published on Dec. 2. The far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) came in second at 18.2%, followed by the co-ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) with 14.36% and the center-right Save Romania Union (USR) with 12.17%, results show. Romania&#x2019;s far-right AUR, campaigning with nationalist slogans, has doubled its results compared to the 2020 elections, reflecting general dissatisfaction with mainstream parties. Their leader, George Simion, was banned from entering Ukraine in 2000 for &quot;systematic anti-Ukrainian activities,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s security services said. Two other nationalist parties &#x2014; SOS Romania of pro-Russian MEP Diana Sosoaca and the Party of Young People (POT) &#x2014; won 7.66% and 6.31% of the vote, respectively. The UDMR party, which represents Romania&apos;s Hungarian minority, also entered the parliament with 6.43% of the vote. The governing PSD-PNL coalition has followed a pro-NATO, pro-Ukraine course under incumbent Social Democratic Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and outgoing President Klaus Iohannis. In October, Romania delivered a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine. Romania holds parliamentary and presidential elections in November and December 2024. Earlier, in the first round of presidential elections, incumbent governing parties PSD and the liberal PNL failed to enter their candidates for the second round, which will be held on Dec. 8. Instead, a largely unknown hard-right candidate and critic of NATO and Ukraine, Calin Georgescu, took the lead. He is expected to face USR&apos;s pro-EU candidate Elena Lasconi. The outcome of the presidential election remains in doubt as the Constitutional Court decides later on Dec. 2 whether the first round&apos;s result should be annulled amid allegations of fraud and foreign interference.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-elections-2/	2024-12-01T23:50:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187154483.jpg
German Chancellor Scholz visits Kyiv for first time in 2.5 years	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Kyiv on Dec. 2 to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirm his country&apos;s support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, German media reported. This marks Scholz&apos;s first visit to Ukraine&apos;s capital in two and a half years. The chancellor&apos;s arrival comes shortly after his controversial phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which drew criticism from Kyiv. Scholz previously visited Kyiv in June 2022 alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, marking the first visit by the three European leaders since the outbreak of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-visits-kyiv-for-first-time-in-2-5-years/	2024-12-01T22:55:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 743,920 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 743,920 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 2. This number includes 1,790 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,478 tanks, 19,397 armored fighting vehicles, 30,606 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,953 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,019 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,886 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-743-920-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-01T22:27:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2003918251.jpg
2 killed, several injured in Russia's attack on Ternopil	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone attack on Ternopil, during the night of Dec. 2, caused a fire in a residential building and resulted in casualties, local officials reported. Ternopil Mayor Serhiy Nadal said that a drone struck the top floor of a high-rise building, with flames engulfing several floors and partially damaging others. The attack killed at least two people and left several others injured. Emergency and rescue teams worked through the night to extinguish the fire and assist the injured, while temporary shelters were prepared for displaced residents. &quot;Doctors are doing everything possible to save the wounded,&quot; Nadal said. Ternopil is a city in western Ukraine with a population of roughly 225,000. Lying hundreds of kilometers from the front line, the city is not a common target of Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-several-injured-in-russias-attack-on-ternopil/	2024-12-01T21:24:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ternopil.jpg
Media: 24-year-old Ukrainian man from Russian-occupied Melitopol accused of 'criminal espionage' by FSB, faces up to 20 years in prison	Leonid Popov, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since 2017, was charged with espionage by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian independent outlet IStories reported on Nov. 29. The case against him was opened in Aug. 2024, but he disappeared over a year before, in Apr. 2023. According to IStories, he has endured a year of abuse while in captivity. Detained by Russian troops a day before his planned evacuation, Popov was held in the basement of the local commandant&#x2019;s office. His cellmate later contacted Popov&#x2019;s parents, warning that he had been severely beaten and was in critical condition. A few months later, Popov weighed just 40 kg despite being nearly two meters tall. &#x201C;Mum, you told me there was a hell, and I&#x2019;ve been there... I was so thirsty, but they wouldn&#x2019;t give me water. And I was even hungrier than I was thirsty,&#x201D; Popov said in a call with his mother from detention. After briefly being released, Popov was re-abducted by Russian forces into an undisclosed location. Popov&#x2019;s schizophrenia condition has likely worsened due to the lack of proper care during his detention. According to some estimates, there could be over 7,000 Ukrainian civilians currently held in Russian-controlled prisons. These people are held in dire conditions, often abused and tortured, without any means of communication. They are also trapped in a legal limbo, as international law prohibits the capture and exchange of civilians for prisoners of war.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-24-year-old-ukrainian-man-from-russian-occupied-melitopol-accused-of-criminal-espionage-by-fsb-faces-up-to-20-years-in-prison/	2024-12-01T19:30:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/Website.png
Over 2 million applications received on first day of new 'eSupport' financial aid program for citizens, Zelensky says	Ukraine&#x2019;s new eSuccess program received over 2.1 million applications on its first day of operation, including nearly half a million for children, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 1. &#x201C;eSuccess works for everyone in Ukraine &#x2013; both adults and children. The numbers are important and prove the timeliness of the program,&#x201D; Zelensky said on Telegram. The assistance, amounting to 1,000 hryvnias ($24) per recipient, can be used for Ukrainian goods and services such as utilities, medicines, books, transportation, and education, or donated to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces through volunteer funds. Applications are open until February 28, 2024, and the funds must be spent by the end of 2025. The initiative aims to provide some economic relief to citizens while fostering support for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense efforts. Around 32% of Ukrainian families have enough income only to buy food, according to a survey published by the ZN.ua media outlet on July 25. Over 48% of respondents said their families &quot;have enough finance for food and clothes but have to save for something more expensive,&quot; while 9% said they &quot;do not have enough money even for food.&quot; Only 7.4% of the respondents can afford everything and require savings only for very expensive purchases. Nearly 1% said that their family can afford anything they want.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-2-million-applications-received-on-first-day-of-new-esupport-financial-aid-program-for-citizens-zelensky-says/	2024-12-01T17:06:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1593404106.jpg
Russian, Syrian jets intensify bombing campaigns in rebel-held territory of Syria, Reuters reports	Russian and Syrian fighter jets have struck the rebel-held city of Idlib on Dec. 1 amid attempts to push back an insurgency that has taken over most of Aleppo, Reuters reported, citing Syrian army sources. The intensive bombing campaigns in Idlib struck crowded areas in the center of the city, Reuters reported, killing four people and injuring dozens more. The renewed bombings come as Syrian rebels swept into the northwestern city of Aleppo on Nov. 30, launching a major attack that forced the army to redeploy. The renewed offensive marks a new stage in a largely frozen conflict, since government forces backed by Russia and Iran pushed rebels out of Aleppo eight years ago. The front lines in the conflict between anti-government rebels and the army of dictator Bashar al-Assad have been mostly frozen since 2020. Damascus has been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces operating in Syria have been accused by the U.N. and other organizations of committing war crimes in the country, including the intentional bombing of hospitals and the usage of &quot;double-tap&quot; attacks, a tactic Russia has repeated in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-syrian-jets/	2024-12-01T15:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1230966025-1.jpg
EU delivered 1 million shells to Ukraine, fulfilling pledge, Kallas says; no estimate for 2025 yet	The European Union has delivered 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine, fulfilling the pledge it initially promised to deliver by the spring of 2024, the EU&#x2019;s new top diplomat Kaja Kallas told the Kyiv Independent on the sidelines of her visit to Kyiv. &quot;This one million rounds of shells have been delivered, but of course, as we know here... it&apos;s not enough, more needs to be done,&quot; Kallas told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview on Dec. 1. &quot;I think also the investments to Ukrainian defence industry are very, very welcome that these things are produced here and immediately used as well. So we are thinking about different initiatives, how we can more support and help Ukraine,&quot; Kallas said. Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister, made the comments during a surprise visit to Kyiv on the first day of her mandate as the EU&apos;s top diplomat. Kallas visited the Ukrainian capital alongside Antonio Costa, the new president of the European Council. When asked by the Kyiv Independent how much military aid Ukraine can expect in 2025, Kallas did not provide a specific estimate. &quot;There is no actual number yet, but I think it&apos;s important we know your needs, and of course, it&apos;s not enough what we are producing. So we need to really speed up the process of producing more,&quot; Kallas said. &quot;We have a new commissioner for defense, we intend to work with him very closely, how we can do this, how we can find also new financing to speed up the process. So there is the political will to do it.&quot; The full delivery of the shells, initially expected to be completed by the end-of-Spring, were delayed into November amid unexpected production capacity limitations, the EU&apos;s former chief diplomat Josep Borrell said on Nov. 11. During a news conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky following their meeting in Kyiv, Costa said that the EU would continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and military assistance to Ukraine, including 4.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) to support the Ukrainian budget by the end of the year. In 2025, the EU will also transfer 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to Ukraine monthly.	https://kyivindependent.com/kalla-kyiv/	2024-12-01T13:33:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GdvI1DAWgAA6SGY.jpeg
US not considering returning nuclear weapons to Ukraine, Sullivan says	The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons the country previously agreed to give up under the Budapest Memorandum, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an interview on Dec. 1. When asked by ABC News whether the U.S. is considering retuning nuclear weapons to Ukraine, Sullivan denied that the escalatory move was in discussion. &quot;That is not under consideration. No. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not nuclear capability,&quot; Sullivan told ABC News. The New York Times reported on Nov. 22 that several U.S. officials have suggested that President Joe Biden was could allow Ukraine to possess nuclear weapons once again. Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in exchange for receiving security guarantees from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. Sullivan&apos;s comments on the issue comes as the Biden administration continues to make series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations, ahead of the January inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump &#x2014; who has criticized military support for Kyiv. These steps included approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. In recent months, Ukrainian officials reportedly floated the proposal of securing nuclear weapons if it is not provided accession into the NATO military alliance. On Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in September that Ukraine must either join NATO or pursue nuclear capabilities for protection. Zelensky later clarified the comments, saying that Ukraine is not pursuing nuclear weapons and the remarks were made to emphasize the failures of the Budapest Memorandum. Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi further said in a statement on Oct. 17 that Ukraine is not planning to develop weapons of mass destruction and remains committed to nuclear non-proliferation. The statement came after the German media outlet Bild reported that Kyiv is preparing to develop nuclear weapons. The story cited an unnamed Ukrainian source. Russia continues to increase its nuclear sabre-rattling, as it has done throughout the full-scale invasion. Despite the Kremlin&apos;s threats, the risk of a nuclear attack is unlikely, Reuters reported, citing five unnamed sources familiar with U.S. intelligence data. As Russia continues to escalate its nuclear rhetoric domestically, 39% of Russians now believe that &quot;the use of nuclear weapons could be justified&quot; in Ukraine, Alexey Levinson, chief of the sociocultural research department at the Russian independent polling organization Levada Center, said at a conference on Nov. 29.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-nuclear-ukraine/	2024-12-01T11:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154173632.jpg
Russia launched nearly 350 missiles, over 2,500 attack drones at Ukraine in November	Russia launched a total of 347 missiles as well as over 2,500 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukraine in November, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a news conference on Dec. 1. During the news conference alongside Antonio Costa, the new President of the European Council, Zelensky called on Western allies to provide additional air defense. &quot;We discussed today the need for adequate air defenses to protect against Russian terror, protect our energy infrastructure and civilians,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I conveyed concrete proposals to our partners to strengthen our air defense. I very much expect their support.&quot; In recent months, Russia has stepped up its attacks targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September. Russia also launched multiple large-scale aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure in the month of November. On Nov. 28, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at the nation&apos;s power grid, with attacks on energy infrastructure occurring throughout the country. Overnight on Nov. 17, Russia launched one of the largest aerial strikes on Ukraine leaving at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions. Russia continues to pummel energy infrastructure set to once again test Ukrainians&apos; resolve ahead an expected harsh winter. Russia has launched tens of thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. The number of drones launched over the past month marks an increase from the 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October. On Oct. 20, Zelensky said that a total of 6,130 Shahed-type drones since the start of 2024 &#x2014; although that number does not account for the thousands of drones launched since. As the war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front continue, Russia also continues to sustain record military losses. In November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in combat operations. Russia also lost weapons and equipment in November estimated to be worth over $3 billion, according to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-347-missiles-over-2-500-attack-drones-at-ukraine-in-november/	2024-12-01T10:47:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-76096673.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'Article 5 cannot apply to entire territory of Ukraine during wartime,' Zelensky says on potential NATO invite	Key Development on Nov. 30 - Dec. 1: If Ukraine were to join NATO, the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1. &quot;We understand that Article 5, when you&apos;re a member of NATO, cannot apply to the entire territory of Ukraine during wartime, as countries are against the risks of being drawn into the war,&quot; Zelensky said during a news conference alongside Antonio Costa, the new President of the European Council, referring to occupied territory. Zelensky&apos;s comments come as Ukraine has been urging NATO allies to invite Ukraine to join the alliance as early as next week, during the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4. &quot;We believe that the invitation should be extended at this stage,&quot; Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on Nov. 29. Earlier this week, Zelensky also suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. &quot;If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should quickly take under NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That&apos;s what we need to do first, and then Ukraine can get back the other parts of its territory in a diplomatic way,&quot; Zelensky said during an interview published on Nov. 29. Clarifying those comments on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that no matter the concessions Ukraine makes to end the war, the entirety of the country must nonetheless be invited into the alliance. &quot;There cannot be an invitation to NATO for only part of Ukraine&apos;s territory. This would automatically mean recognizing that all other territories are not only at risk but also not Ukrainian. Therefore, Ukraine will never agree to this. If there is an invitation, it must include all of Ukraine&apos;s territories.&quot; Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s accession into the military alliance. Some reports also indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Throughout the U.S. election campaign, NATO allies concerned about the prospects of the Unites States&apos; support for NATO under a Trump administration led some of the alliance members to attempt to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; long-term aid for Ukraine, as well as reinforce the principle of collective defense. In February, Trump said that we would let Russia do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, while encouraging countries to spend more on defense. The Russian army suffered record losses in military equipment and personnel in November in the war against Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Dec. 1. Russian losses at the front increased significantly in the fall, while Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. In November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in combat operations. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army, according to the ministry. November also saw the record broken for the enemy personnel losses in one day with 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022. In November, Ukrainian forces also destroyed 307 Russian tanks, 899 armored combat vehicles, and 884 pieces of artillery. According to the ministry&apos;s calculations, Russia&apos;s lost weapons and equipment in November is estimated to be worth over $3 billion, which is more than in September and October. As of the morning of Dec. 1, the Russian army had lost about 742,130 soldiers, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Over the past day, Russian losses amounted to 1,730 people. Ukraine destroyed three Russian high-value radar stations in Russian-occupied Crimea on Nov. 29, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 30. The radars include two 48Y6-K1 Podlet systems worth $5 million each and one Kasta-2E2 radar, estimated to cost around $30 million. Both Kasta and Podlet are modern mobile radar systems designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The report came just a day after HUR claimed to have struck another Podlet radar system in Crimea on Nov. 28. HUR claimed to be behind both operations but didn&apos;t provide details. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claims. Multiple explosions were reported across Crimea over the past week, with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in the occupied peninsula during the full-scale war. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since Nov. 5, sources speaking to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Hungarian Service acknowledged. Hungarian government insiders revealed that Trump sought Orban&#x2019;s opinion on strategies to end the Ukraine war. During his campaign, Trump criticized the billions of dollars the U.S. has allocated to Ukraine and claimed he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the White House. Observers interpret his remarks as implying that Ukraine might need to cede territory currently under Russian control. Orban, known for his close ties with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has openly criticized EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Moscow. Reports indicate Orban is preparing for a second peace mission in December, which aims to conclude Hungary&#x2019;s rotating EU presidency. In July, he initiated his first mission with a trip to Kyiv carrying a cease-fire proposal for President Volodymyr Zelensky, followed by a controversial meeting with Putin in Moscow. Orban later traveled to China and then the U.S. to meet Trump while he was campaigning. Sources noted to RFE/RL that the December peace mission may involve Orban delivering messages from Trump to Zelensky, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, the specific details of the plan remain unclear. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the Russian budget on Dec. 1, which plans for record levels military spending over the next three years. The Russian State Duma, the lower house of Russia&apos;s parliament, passed the law on the federal budget for 2025 and the planning period of 2026-2027 in November. According to the law signed by Putin, in 2025, national defense spending will reach a record 13.5 trillion rubles ($126 billion), more than 6% of Russia&apos;s GDP. Spending on war and law enforcement agencies exceeds expenditures on education, healthcare, social policy, and the national economy combined. The new three-year budget envisages that military spending will be slightly lower in 2026-2027: 12.8 trillion rubles ($114.9 billion) in 2026 and 13.1 trillion rubles ($122.4 billion) in 2027. The total expenditures of the Russian budget next year are planned at 41.47 trillion rubles ($387.3 billion), accounting for 19.3% of GDP. This is 1.17 trillion rubles ($15.9 billion) more than the expected revenues. The budget deficit is expected to be 2.18 trillion rubles ($20.3 billion) and 2.76 trillion rubles ($25.8 billion), respectively, in 2026 and 2027. On Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed law on Ukraine&apos;s own state budget for 2025. The budget for 2025 envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). On Nov. 12, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said the budget envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production. Some Hr 54.55 billion ($1.3 billion) will be directly allocated for the development and implementation of new technologies and the expansion of defense production capacity, according to Smetanin. The minister added that the 2025 figure is almost Hr 3.5 billion ($84.4 million) more than in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-47/	2024-12-01T09:50:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Article 5 cannot apply to entire territory of Ukraine during wartime,' Zelensky says on potential NATO invite	If Ukraine were to join NATO, the alliance&apos;s Article 5 collective defense principle may not apply to Ukrainian territories facing active combat, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1. &quot;We understand that Article 5, when you&apos;re a member of NATO, cannot apply to the entire territory of Ukraine during wartime, as countries are against the risks of being drawn into the war,&quot; Zelensky said during a news conference alongside Antonio Costa, the new President of the European Council. Zelensky&apos;s comments come as Ukraine has been urging NATO allies to invite Ukraine to join the alliance as early as next week, during the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4. &quot;We believe that the invitation should be extended at this stage,&quot; Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on Nov. 29. Earlier this week, Zelensky also suggested ending the &quot;hot phase&quot; of war along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front in exchange for NATO membership, not immediately including occupied territories. &quot;If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should quickly take under NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That&apos;s what we need to do first, and then Ukraine can get back the other parts of its territory in a diplomatic way,&quot; Zelensky said during an interview published on Nov. 29. Clarifying those comments on Dec. 1, Zelensky said that no matter the concessions Ukraine makes to end the war, the entirety of the country must nonetheless be invited into the alliance. &quot;There cannot be an invitation to NATO for only part of Ukraine&apos;s territory. This would automatically mean recognizing that all other territories are not only at risk but also not Ukrainian. Therefore, Ukraine will never agree to this. If there is an invitation, it must include all of Ukraine&apos;s territories.&quot; Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s accession into the military alliance. Some reports also indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Throughout the U.S. election campaign, NATO allies concerned about the prospects of the Unites States&apos; support for NATO under a Trump administration led some of the alliance members to attempt to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; long-term aid for Ukraine, as well as reinforce the principle of collective defense. In February, Trump said that we would let Russia do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, while encouraging countries to spend more on defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/article-5-cannot-apply-to-the-entire-territory-of-ukraine-during-wartime-zelensky-says-on-potential-nato-invite/	2024-12-01T08:58:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg

Russia loses almost 46,000 troops, over $3 billion worth of military equipment in November, Defense Ministry says	The Russian army suffered record losses in military equipment and personnel in November in the war against Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Dec. 1. Russian losses at the front increased significantly in the fall, while Russia continued to advance in the Donetsk sector, aiming to capture the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. In November, 45,720 Russian soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured and thus unable to continue participating in combat operations. This number is equivalent to more than three motorized rifle divisions of the Russian army, according to the ministry. November also saw the record broken for the enemy personnel losses in one day with 2,030, the highest figure since Feb. 24, 2022. In November, Ukrainian forces also destroyed 307 Russian tanks, 899 armored combat vehicles, and 884 pieces of artillery. According to the ministry&apos;s calculations, Russia&apos;s lost weapons and equipment in November is estimated to be worth over $3 billion, which is more than in September and October. As of the morning of Dec. 1, the Russian army had lost about 742,130 soldiers, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Over the past day, Russian losses amounted to 1,730 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-loses-record-almost-46-000-troops-over-3-billion-worth-of-military-equipment-in-november-defense-ministry-says/	2024-12-01T07:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258947571.jpg
Zelensky meets with new president of European Council, top EU diplomat in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky met in Kyiv on Dec. 1 with Antonio Costa, the new President of the European Council, and top European Union diplomat Kaja Kallas. Kallas and Costa arrived in Kyiv on a surprise visit on the first day of the mandate of the new &#xA0;European Commission. Zelensky discussed with Costa &quot;the vision of European and global affairs, current challenges and prospects.&quot; &quot;Peace is the foundation, and we will continue to do everything possible to end this war, which Russia has unleashed not only against Ukraine but also against a united Europe, as soon as possible and to strengthen Europe &#x2014; both the EU institutions and the policies that support every European nation,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. During a joint press conference with Zelensky, Costa said the European Union would open two accession negotiating clusters with Ukraine in the first half of 2025. According to Costa, the EU is hugely &quot;impressed&quot; that Ukraine has managed to carry out &quot;most of the most important reforms&quot; necessary to join the European community during the war. As accession negotiations continue, certain categories of goods could enter the EU single market as if Ukraine were already a member of the European community, he added. Costa also assured that the EU would continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and military assistance to Ukraine, including 4.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) to support the Ukrainian budget by the end of the year. In 2025, the EU will transfer 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to Ukraine monthly. &quot;We will receive these funds from the use of frozen Russian assets, and they can also be used for military purposes,&quot; Costa said. With the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kallas, Zelensky discussed the need for air defense systems &quot;to protect lives in Ukraine,&quot; as he wrote on Telegram. The EU representatives, accompanied by Zelensky, also visited the Wall of Remembrance near Mykhailivska Square in Kyiv and paid tribute to the fallen Ukrainian soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-new-president-of-european-council-top-eu-diplomat-in-kyiv/	2024-12-01T06:50:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Gdtsx0UXUAAwp67.jpeg
Russian drone attack against shuttle bus in Kherson, kills 3, injures at least 8	Russia struck a shuttle bus in the regional center of Kherson on Dec. 1, killing three and injuring eight people, local authorities reported. The attack occurred at 8:15 a.m. local time in the Dniprovskyi district of the city. There were 15 people in the vehicle at the time of the strike. Seven of the injured were immediately hospitalized. Another victim, a 70-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital later with a mine-blast injury and a fractured tibia, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The injured were diagnosed with shrapnel wounds and various wounds to the chest, abdomen, arms, and legs, Vitalii Khomukha, head of the surgical department of the city hospital, told Suspilne. Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces liberated Kherson and other settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian troops were pushed to the river&apos;s east bank, from where they have since been firing at the liberated territories, regularly resulting in civilian deaths, as well as large-scale destruction of homes and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-against-shuttle-bus-in-kherson-kills-3-injures-at-least-8/	2024-12-01T05:59:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-01-15_44_34.jpeg
Kremlin dismisses commander of its forces in Syria amid 'significant' losses, Ukraine's military intelligence says	Russia&apos;s leadership has dismissed General Sergei Kisel, who commanded Moscow&apos;s military group in Syria, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 1. Following years of low-intensity fighting, rebels led by the radical group Tahrir al-Sham entered Aleppo on Nov. 29 and engaged the government forces of President Bashar al-Assad. They left the city and reported that they were preparing a counteroffensive. Pro-Assad Syrian government forces had held nearly 70% of the country with the support of Russia, Iran, and allies from Hezbollah, a terrorist group based in Lebanon, according to the Associated Press. Russian troops deployed in Syria have suffered &quot;significant&quot; losses, some Russian units are surrounded, and &quot;hundreds&quot; of Russian soldiers are missing, according to HUR. Before serving in Syria, Kisel participated in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine but was dismissed from his post due to his failed activities, the intelligence&apos;s report read. According to Ukrainian intelligence, Kisel will be replaced by another Russian general, Alexander Chaiko, who has already arrived in Syria. Chaiko commanded Russian troops in Syria from 2017 until 2019. Russian Navy Commander Admiral Alexander Moiseev also appeared at the naval base in Tartus, HUR added. Moscow has not yet commented on the new appointments to the army in Syria. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence&apos;s claims. Russian warplanes previously joined the Syrian Air Force in bombing rebel positions in the northwestern city of Aleppo, Syria, Reuters reported, citing two undisclosed Syrian military sources. The reports of the Nov. 30 attacks came the day after Islamists and their Turkish-backed allies broke through to Syria&apos;s second-largest city Aleppo. On Nov. 29, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia considers the rebels&apos; actions as &quot;a violation of Syria&apos;s sovereignty.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-dismisses-commander-of-its-forces-in-syria-amid-significant-losses-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-12-01T05:05:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258667288.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Dec. 2-Dec. 8. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs Meeting will take place in Brussels on Dec. 3-4. The NATO-Ukraine Council meets on Dec. 3, it will consider Ukraine&apos;s possible accession to the alliance (Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged colleagues for a formal decision as an outcome) and discuss expectations for the upcoming Trump administration. Foreign ministers will also meet with the King of Jordan. Romania&apos;s top court is set to announce on Dec. 2 whether it will annul the first round of a presidential election. Anti-Western candidate C&#x103;lin Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory in the first round (vs. earlier polls that mostly gave him 5-8% support) sparked concerns about election interference and prompted a vote recount. Georgescu, a nationalist candidate, supports Russia and opposes aid for Ukraine while praising 1930s fascist leaders. Despite his claim of having spent no money on his campaign, investigations point to a well-produced and orchestrated effort (with suspicions of Russian involvement). Pro-Western candidate Elena Lasconi took second place, beating Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu by just 0.3%. If the court upholds the first-round results, Lasconi and Georgescu will compete in a Dec. 8 runoff. However, if the court annuls the results, a new first round could take place on Dec. 15. The plenary week of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine is scheduled for Dec. 3-6. The previous plenary week ended with the cancellation of the Nov. 22 session due to the threat of a Russian strike on the government quarter. Two energy bills, legislation on simplifying economic activity, and regulations regarding debtors may appear on this week&apos;s agenda. Next week may also see the Rada consider a law criminalizing the unauthorized use, sale or distribution of data from public registers. While presented as a security measure, this law is likely directed at constraining press activity. In parallel, Western diplomats are delving into media freedom issues, particularly after Ukrayinska Pravda&#x2019;s public statements on pressure from the Office of the President.

Zourabichvili says she'll remain Georgian president until legitimate parliament elected	Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said on Nov. 30 that she would remain president until a legitimate parliament is elected, the media outlet Echo of the Caucasus reported. Zourabichvili&apos;s statement comes amid protests sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s decision to postpone Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union until 2028. Police reportedly used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse demonstrators in Tbilisi on Nov. 29, but protests have now spread to Batumi, Zugdidi, Kutaisi, Telavi, Gurjaani, and other Georgian cities. An illegitimate parliament will not be able to elect a new head of state, Zourabichvili said. According to the president, the inauguration will not occur due to these circumstances, and her mandate will continue until the new parliament elects a new president. &quot;I want to tell the public that there is a national consensus here with the president, who is the only independent, legitimate institution,&quot; Zourabichvili said, adding that she will meet with &quot;the society and political parties&quot; on Dec. 1. &quot;Together, we are leading the political process that you (Georgian citizens) are leading outside, in the streets, and various spheres of society. I will lead the political process while remaining your president.&quot; Previously, the country&apos;s ruling party, Georgian Dream, announced that the presidential election would be held on Dec. 14 and the inauguration on Dec. 29. For the first time, the president of Georgia will not be elected by the population but by the Electoral Board, in which the Georgian Dream will have the majority. Parliamentary Speaker Shalva Papuashvili claimed that Zourabichvili&apos;s six-year term as President expires on Dec. 16. The Georgian Dream party, now led by Kobakhidze, has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law prompted mass protests and violent police crackdowns. The October parliamentary elections kicked off another round of protests amid accusations that Georgian Dream perpetrated widespread fraud and rigged the vote. Following the vote, the European Commission suspended Georgia&apos;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West. While pro-EU Georgians took to the streets in protest, Kobakhidze defended his decision to delay EU accession and said that a &quot;Maidan situation&quot; would not happen in Georgia. &quot;(U)nlike Ukraine in 2013, Georgia is an independent state with strong institutions and, most importantly, experienced and wise people whose power no one can shake. The Maiden scenario cannot be realized in Georgia,&quot; Kobakhidze said during a government press conference. His remarks refer to Ukraine&apos;s 2013 EuroMaidan Revolution, a months-long popular uprising provoked by former President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s refusal to sign a much-anticipated Association Agreement with the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/zourabichvili-says-shell-remain-georgian-president-until-legitimate-parliament-elected/	2024-12-01T04:25:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180328725.jpg
Defense Ministry introduces military medical commissions reforms to be implemented by fall of 2025	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, in cooperation with the Health Ministry, presented a draft reform of military medical commissions to be implemented by November 2025, according to the statement published on Nov. 30. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. During the presentation, Deputy Defense Minister Serhii Melnyk said that the principles of the commissions&apos; work &quot;have not changed for decades,&quot; and the current system is &quot;a vestige of the old administrative approach.&quot; &quot;It has flaws, unnecessary bureaucratic complications, and corruption risks. We must significantly reduce these risks,&quot; Melnyk added. According to the presentation&apos;s participants, the current system of medical commissions has &quot;double-sided disadvantages,&quot; allowing individuals to avoid military service without legal grounds and, at the same time, not preventing people with serious illnesses from joining the military, which creates additional difficulties for the Ukrainian army. The reform is expected to divide the commissions&apos; decisions into two data sets: medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct medical examinations for medical commissions, while others will analyze the anonymized results. Persons liable for military service will no longer need to go to enlistment offices to get a referral for a medical examination. Instead, they will be able to choose a hospital to undergo the process, with their data then transferred into the Electronic Healthcare System. The data will then be sent to the Ukrainian Armed Forces medical commissions, which will decide whether a person is fit to serve in the army for health reasons. The anonymized data will be sent to a random commission whose members will not know whose documents they are reviewing, which is expected to prevent data manipulation and corruption risks. &quot;This reform is necessary for those liable for military service to trust the system. To undergo medical examinations in civilian facilities. To feel that their rights are protected and that after the medical examination, they are not immediately recognized as fit if they have any illnesses,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Kateryna Chernohorenko said. According to Chernohorenko, a &quot;digital trace&quot; will be visible after each decision &#x2014; electronic signatures of both the doctor and the military medical commission employee. The commissions&apos; conclusions will be stored. These steps should simplify the verification and monitoring of the commissions&apos; activities by law enforcement agencies, Chernohorenko added.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-presents-concept-of-reforming-military-medical-commissions-to-be-implemented-by-fall-of-2025/	2024-12-01T03:19:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/umerov.jpg
Putin approves Russia's budget with record spending on national defense	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the Russian budget on Dec. 1, which plans for record levels military spending over the next three years. The Russian State Duma, the lower house of Russia&apos;s parliament, passed the law on the federal budget for 2025 and the planning period of 2026-2027 in November. According to the law signed by Putin, in 2025, national defense spending will reach a record 13.5 trillion rubles ($126 billion), more than 6% of Russia&apos;s GDP. Spending on war and law enforcement agencies exceeds expenditures on education, healthcare, social policy, and the national economy combined. The new three-year budget envisages that military spending will be slightly lower in 2026-2027: 12.8 trillion rubles ($114.9 billion) in 2026 and 13.1 trillion rubles ($122.4 billion) in 2027. The total expenditures of the Russian budget next year are planned at 41.47 trillion rubles ($387.3 billion), accounting for 19.3% of GDP. This is 1.17 trillion rubles ($15.9 billion) more than the expected revenues. The budget deficit is expected to be 2.18 trillion rubles ($20.3 billion) and 2.76 trillion rubles ($25.8 billion), respectively, in 2026 and 2027. On Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed law on Ukraine&apos;s own state budget for 2025. The budget for 2025 envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). On Nov. 12, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said the budget envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production. Some Hr 54.55 billion ($1.3 billion) will be directly allocated for the development and implementation of new technologies and the expansion of defense production capacity, according to Smetanin. The minister added that the 2025 figure is almost Hr 3.5 billion ($84.4 million) more than in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-approves-russias-budget-with-record-spending-on-national-defense/	2024-12-01T02:19:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182540042.jpg
Russian oligarch Usmanov elected to head International Fencing Federation despite US, EU sanctions	Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov was elected president of the International Fencing Federation (FIE) following a vote by the Congress in Tashkent on Nov. 30, Reuters reported, citing the businessman&apos;s representative. Usmanov, 71, headed the federation until the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, when the European Union and the U.S. first sanctioned him as a person who fueled Russian aggression in Ukraine. The same year, Usmanov stepped down from international fencing, and his then-deputy Emmanuel Katsiadakis became the acting president of the body. During the FIE Congress on Nov. 30, 120 member countries voted for Usmanov, and 26 voted for his opponent, the president of the Swedish Fencing Federation, Otto Drakenberg, according to Reuters. Ahead of the election of the new FIE president, Drakenberg in October asked the FIE Ethics Committee and Katsiadakis about &quot;the criteria on which Usmanov&apos;s candidacy was approved, given the very significant sanctions.&quot; Drakenberg also called for Usmanov&apos;s exclusion from the elections, calling his possible return to power in an international organization &quot;absurd.&quot; Katsiadakis, in turn, sent a letter to the Swedish Fencing Federation, claiming that Usmanov&apos;s candidacy complied with the FIE charter &quot;despite the sanctions currently being applied to him.&quot; As long as international sanctions are in place, Usmanov cannot work at the FIE&apos;s Swiss headquarters or travel to most international tournaments, including the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, after being elected, the Russian oligarch said he would continue to take milestone measures to prevent &quot;legally unjustified restrictions&quot; from being imposed on him. Usmanov was first elected president of the FIE in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, 2016, and 2021. His fourth term in office ended early in 2022. With the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Russian and Belarusian fencers were suspended from competing in tournaments under the auspices of the FIE. In early March 2023, the FIE returned athletes from Russia and Belarus to competitions under neutral status. At the same time, the ban on the countries entering team competitions remained in force. In the summer, the FIE Disciplinary Tribunal refused to consider Ukraine&apos;s Fencing Federation&apos;s complaint against Russia&apos;s membership in the organization. Following the refusal, the Ukrainian governing body appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oligarch-usmanov-heads-international-fencing-federation-despite-us-eu-sanctions/	2024-12-01T01:36:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1065791506.jpg

Trump has consulted Hungary's Orban on Ukraine war, sources tell RFE/RL	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since Nov. 5, sources speaking to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Hungarian Service acknowledged. Hungarian government insiders revealed that Trump sought Orban&#x2019;s opinion on strategies to end the Ukraine war. During his campaign, Trump criticized the billions of dollars the U.S. has allocated to Ukraine and claimed he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the White House. Observers interpret his remarks as implying that Ukraine might need to cede territory currently under Russian control. Orban, known for his close ties with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has openly criticized EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Moscow. Reports indicate Orban is preparing for a second peace mission in December, which aims to conclude Hungary&#x2019;s rotating EU presidency. In July, he initiated his first mission with a trip to Kyiv carrying a cease-fire proposal for President Volodymyr Zelensky, followed by a controversial meeting with Putin in Moscow. Orban later traveled to China and then the U.S. to meet Trump while he was campaigning.

North Macedonia arrests man for attempting to join Russian army	Police in North Macedonia have arrested a Macedonian national suspected of planning to join the Russian army to fight in Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s Interior Ministry announced. This marks the first instance of a Macedonian citizen facing charges under this specific offense. North Macedonia, a NATO member since 2020, has imposed sanctions on Russia. Authorities identified the man by his initials, J.K., and detained him late on Nov. 29, according to the Associated Press. An investigative judge ordered him to remain under house arrest for 30 days. He faces charges of &quot;participating in a foreign army, police, paramilitary or parapolice formation.&quot; If convicted, the man could receive a minimum sentence of three years. According to the ministry, the suspect communicated online with an individual who claimed to be recruiting soldiers for the Russian army, offering compensation of 3,000 euros. The suspect expressed willingness to join a newly formed detachment and traveled to Moscow in October. Upon returning to North Macedonia a week later, the suspect underwent questioning at Skopje airport. During the interrogation, he admitted plans to &quot;sign a contract for work in the Russian army and be taken to a training camp where he would be trained to fight in Ukraine.&quot; Police searched the man&#x2019;s home on Nov. 29 and confiscated documentation related to the case.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-macedonia-arrests-man-for-attempting-to-join-russian-army/	2024-11-30T20:49:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166708000.jpg
Expert links drone sightings over military bases in UK to Russian, Chinese threats, Guardian reports	A former UFO investigator with the U.K.&apos;s Ministry of Defense has suggested potential links between recent drone incursions at the Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in the U.K. and foreign adversaries, including Russia and China, the Guardian reports on Nov. 30. The drones were spotted between Nov. 20 and 22 over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, bases used by the U.S. Air Force. While the U.S. officials could not confirm if the drones were hostile, their appearance coincided with ongoing preparations for RAF Lakenheath&#x2019;s upcoming nuclear mission. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t rule out the activity being connected with nuclear weapons,&#x201D; Nick Pope, former UF investigator, told the Guardian. He explained that adversaries might deploy drones to collect intelligence on nuclear operations, avoiding riskier methods such as using declared intelligence officers. The incursions are not unprecedented at RAF bases linked to nuclear weapons. In 1980, U.S. airmen stationed at RAF Bentwaters reported witnessing unidentified objects over nearby Rendlesham Forest, including crafts that reportedly sent beams of light into the weapons storage area. Pope described this case as unique due to its &quot;multiple witnesses, including the military,&quot; as well as physical evidence such as radar data and ground markings. Despite these connections, Pope considers commercial drones the most likely explanation for the November incidents. &quot;Perhaps some are operated by plane spotters, but as most of these people abide by CAA rules on drone operation, it&#x2019;s more likely to be the work of irresponsible hobbyists,&quot; he said. While Pope acknowledged that adversary involvement couldn&#x2019;t be ruled out, especially given the timing of U.K.-supplied missile strikes in Ukraine, he emphasized the lack of current evidence supporting this theory. Misidentified items, such as Chinese lanterns or the star Sirius, might also account for some sightings, the expert added.	https://kyivindependent.com/expert-links-drone-sightings-over-military-bases-in-uk-to-russian-chinese-threats-guardian-reports/	2024-11-30T19:32:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1740772901.jpg
Moscow nightclub raids target LGBTQ+ community amid Russia's crackdown on 'propaganda'	Russian police conducted raids on several bars and nightclubs across Moscow on Nov. 30, intensifying the government&#x2019;s ongoing crackdown on what it calls &quot;LGBTQ+ propaganda,&quot; according to Russian state media. Officers reportedly seized smartphones, laptops, and video cameras while inspecting clubgoers&apos; documents. Tass, Russia&#x2019;s state news agency, cited law enforcement sources in its coverage of the events. The raids coincide with the one-year anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s Supreme Court decision to classify the &quot;LGBTQ+ movement&quot; as an &quot;extremist organization.&quot; The ruling followed a years-long effort to suppress LGBTQ+ rights in the country, with President Vladimir Putin frequently emphasizing &quot;traditional family values&quot; as a key aspect of his administration during his 25 years in power. Videos circulating on social media showed a heavy police presence at Moscow&#x2019;s Arma nightclub. In one clip, officers appeared to order partygoers to lie on the floor while the venue was searched. Another venue, Mono bar, was also reportedly targeted in the raids. Authorities also detained the head of the &quot;Men Travel&quot; tour agency under Russia&#x2019;s anti-LGBT laws. Tass reported that the 48-year-old is suspected of planning a trip for &quot;supporters of nontraditional sexual values&quot; to Egypt during Russia&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s holidays. The raids reflect the broader fears expressed by activists who warned about the potential consequences of labeling the LGBTQ+ movement as &quot;extremist&quot; despite it not being a formal organization. Other recent legislative measures, including the Nov. 23 law banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legan, show the Kremlin&#x2019;s push to enforce &quot;traditional values.&quot; The law targets over a dozen countries, including several in Europe, as well as Australia, Argentina, and Canada. Putin also signed a law prohibiting the dissemination of informational material encouraging people not to have children.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-nightclub-raids-target-lgbtq-community-amid-russias-crackdown-on-propaganda/	2024-11-30T16:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-494819029.jpg
War has caused significant damage to most of Ukraine's civilian airports, PM Shmyhal says	At least 15 of Ukraine&apos;s 20 civilian airports have sustained damage since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 30. Ukraine, which has kept its airspace entirely closed since the all-out war began, has been exploring options to partially reopen it. Currently, Ukrainians traveling abroad must use road or rail to reach neighboring countries, most often Poland, to catch flights. For those in the eastern regions, the journey out of Ukraine alone can take up to a day. &quot;We conducted a risk assessment and determined the needs of the air defense forces to partially open the airspace,&quot; Shmyhal said during a transportation conference, according to the local news agency Ukrinform. &quot;Security issues and the military situation remain key to this decision,&quot; he added. Shmyhal also noted that Russia had targeted Ukraine&apos;s port infrastructure nearly 60 times over the past three months, damaging or destroying close to 300 facilities and 22 civilian vessels. Earlier this month, Crispin Ellison, a senior partner at insurance broker Marsh McLennan, said that one of Ukraine&apos;s airports, Lviv or Boryspil International Airport, close to the capital, could potentially resume operations by the end of January 2025. Ellison noted during the Kyiv International Economic Forum that securing aviation insurance will be easier if planes use Lviv Airport, but President Volodymyr Zelensky insists that Boryspil be opened first. &quot;Opening Lviv is the beginning of a journey to opening up Boryspil,&quot; Ellison told a Kyiv Independent reporter on Nov. 7. The Presidential Office will make the final decision on the flights, considering the security situation and the performance of Ukrainian air defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-has-caused-significant-damage-to-most-of-ukraines-civilian-airports-pm-shmyhal-says/	2024-11-30T15:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1238442755.jpg
Construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia nearly complete, governor says	The construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia and nearby settlements is nearly finished, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Nov. 30. Ukraine has been building heavy fortifications near the city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region. &quot;We are completing the next stage of fortification construction. ... The multi-level defense of Zaporizhzhia and nearby settlements is almost complete,&quot; Fedorov said via Telegram. Fedorov said the designs for the fortifications have been &quot;significantly improved&quot; compared to previous versions and that the modernized defenses are particularly adept at repelling drone attacks. Fedorov&apos;s announcement comes after warnings from Kyiv of a possible Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25 that Ukraine is tracking Russian troop movement in the southern region, and has observed &quot;existing threats.&quot; Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 11 that Russia could launch a renewed offensive on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Russia has also begun deploying assault groups to frontline positions in region, Voloshyn said. Russia is also carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia is currently advancing at its fastest rate since 2022, according to analysts from the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo.	https://kyivindependent.com/construction-of-fortifications-in-zaporizhzhia-nearly-complete-governor-says/	2024-11-30T14:11:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2107848216.jpg
US suspends strategic partnership with Georgia amid mass protests	The United States is suspending the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership due to the anti-democratic actions of the ruling Georgian Dream party, State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller announced on Nov. 30. The announcement comes amid mass anti-government protests across Georgia, sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s decision to delay Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union. &quot;Georgian Dream&#x2019;s various anti-democratic actions have violated the core tenets of our U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership,&quot; Miller said. &quot;As a result, the United States has suspended this mechanism.&quot; Miller criticized Georgian Dream&apos;s decision to suspend EU accession talks and denounced the government&apos;s crackdown on protesters. &quot;By suspending Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession process, Georgian Dream has rejected the opportunity for closer ties with Europe and made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin. ... The United States condemns the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest.&quot; Tbilisi&apos;s ties with the U.S. and other Western countries have steadily deteriorated since the pro-Russian Georgian Dream adopted a controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law in May. Tensions only mounted after Georgian Dream declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections despite widespread accusations of a rigged vote. The Georgian government&apos;s democratic backsliding and shift toward Moscow has led the U.S. to halt cooperation projects and cutt financial assistance, deepening the chasm between former allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-strategic-partnership-with-georgia-amid-mass-protests/	2024-11-30T12:25:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/miller.jpg
Protests erupt across Georgia in defiance of government's anti-EU stance	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story. Mass protests against the pro-Russian government have broken out in major cities across Georgia, despite police attempts to disperse demonstrators, the Georgian outlet Sova News reported on Nov. 30. The protests were sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s decision to postpone Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union until 2028. Police reportedly used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse demonstrators in Tbilisi on Nov. 29, but protests have now spread to Batumi, Zugdidi, Kutaisi, Telavi, Gurjaani, and other Georgian cities. Thousands of protesters have again amassed in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Rustaveli Avenue, completely blocking the street. Protesters have begun erecting barricades near the parliament building, Echo of the Caucasus reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/protests-erupt-across-georgia-in-defiance-of-governments-anti-eu-stance/	2024-11-30T12:09:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186710736.jpg
CERN ends cooperation with Russian institutes	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) on Nov. 30 officially cut ties with research institutes in Russia, in accordance with a decision to allow the cooperation agreements to expire due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Following the full-scale invasion, the CERN Council in 2022 declared its intention to terminate its International Cooperation Agreements (ICAs) with Russia and Belarus after their expiration in 2024. The Council affirmed the decision in fall of 2023. The decision means that some 350 Russian scientists will now be expelled from CERN, which is based near Geneva on Swiss and French territory. Cooperation with Russian scientists associated with CERN under different agreements will continue, the news agency Swissinfo reported. CERN&apos;s cooperation with researchers from Belarusian institutes ended earlier this year, when their ICA expired in June. ICAs normally run for five years, with the expectation that they will be renewed for the same period of time unless either party submits notice at least six months before the expiration date. CERN is the world&apos;s largest particle physics research center and the operator of the Large Hadron Collider. Russia has never been a CERN member state, but held status as an observer state. This meant Russia did not contribute to the agency&apos;s budget and had no decision-making rights.	https://kyivindependent.com/cern-ends-cooperation-with-russian-institutes/	2024-11-30T11:32:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1174703796.jpg
Russian attack in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast kills 3, injures 21	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the Dniprovskyi district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast the evening of Nov. 30, killing three people and injuring at least 21 others, regional governor Serhii Lysak reported. An 11-year-old boy is among the wounded, Lysak said. He is being treated in the hospital, along with the rest of the injured victims. Eight are in serious condition. Explosions occurred in the Dniprovskyi district, igniting three fires in the area, the governor said. A shop, an apartment building, and a home caught fire following the attack. Authorities have not disclosed details regarding the mode of attack or the identity of the other victims. Ukraine&apos;s southeastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is regularly targeted by Russian attacks. Russia on Nov. 21 targeted both the regional capital of Dnipro and the region&apos;s second-largest city, Kryvyi Rih, with large-scale attacks. The attack on Dnipro involved an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), referred to by Russia as &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; which marked an escalation in Russia&apos;s aerial attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-dnipropetrovsk-oblast-kills-3-injures-21/	2024-11-30T09:58:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2098827396.jpg
Syrian rebels take over Aleppo as Russia pledges to assist Assad regime	Syrian rebels swept into the northwestern city of Aleppo on Nov. 30, launching a major attack that forced the army to redeploy, the Syrian army reported. Russia has promised Damascus additional military assistance that is expected to arrive in the next 72 hours, two sources in the Syrian military told Reuters. The attack marks a new stage in a largely frozen conflict, since government forces backed by Russia and Iran pushed rebels out of Aleppo eight years ago. The front lines in the conflict between anti-government rebels and the army of dictator Bashar al-Assad have been mostly frozen since 2020. Rebels launched the shock offensive from areas of northwestern Syria that remain outside of Assad&apos;s control. In response to advancing rebel forces, the Russian air force on Nov. 29 carried out an aerial attack against Aleppo and bordering Idlib province, Russian state media reported. The attacks against Idlib reportedly killed four civilians and injured 25 others, including eight children, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, a rescue service working in opposition-held areas of Syria. The Syrian government and Russian warplanes again targeted residential neighborhoods of Aleppo with strikes on Nov. 30, the Syrian Civil Defense said in a post on X. The Syrian military claimed the strikes kept the rebels from establishing fixed positions in Aleppo, although the state army was still forced to withdraw. The army is now carrying out &quot;a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defense lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers, and prepare for a counterattack,&quot; the Syrian military command said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov condemned the insurgent attack in remarks on Nov. 29. &quot;We are in favor of the Syrian authorities bringing order to the area and restoring constitutional order as soon as possible,&quot; he said. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Damascus has been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces operating in Syria have been accused by the U.N. and other organizations of committing war crimes in the country, including the intentional bombing of hospitals and the usage of &quot;double-tap&quot; attacks, a tactic Russia has repeated in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrian-rebels-take-over-aleppo-as-russia-pledges-to-assist-assad-regime/	2024-11-30T09:23:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186777930.jpg
Scholz criticized opposition for proposing Taurus missiles ultimatum for Russia	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized opposition leader Friedrich Merz for proposing that Berlin send Russia an ultimatum about possible deliveries of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. According to Tagesschau, Scholz made the statement at his party conference in Berlin. &quot;All I can say is: be careful! You don&apos;t play Russian roulette with Germany&apos;s security,&quot; Scholz said, claiming that Merz wants to give Russia, a nuclear power, an ultimatum about possible transfers of long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz&apos;s statement comes as Germany faces political turmoil, with opposition criticising the Chancellor&apos;s consistent refusal to send German-made Tauruses to Ukraine. During the conference, Scholz emphasized the importance of a calm and measured approach, according to the report. When it comes to questions of war and peace, cooler heads are needed, Scholz said. He promised to remain &quot;steadfast and level-headed.&quot; Scholz also stressed that real negotiations on a possible peace plan should not take place &quot;over the head of Ukraine.&quot; Merz, the parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate of the center-right CDU/CSU party, has previously spoken in support of sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir Putin) should be told that if he does not stop bombing civilians in Ukraine within 24 hours, Germany should send Taurus missiles to destroy the supply lines that the regime uses to harm the civilian population of Ukraine,&quot; he told Bundestag on Oct. 16. Merz is currently the candidate poised to unseat social democrat Scholz in the federal parliamentary elections, which could be held as early as February 2025 due to the collapse of Germany&apos;s government coalition in November. Kyiv has repeatedly asked Berlin, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, to supply Taurus missiles, which have a range of up to 500 kilometers &#x2014; significantly farther than other Western long-range missiles. Scholz has consistenly refused to budge on Taurus missile transfers, even as other Western allies, including France, the U.K., and the U.S., eventually sent their own long-range weapons to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-criticized-opposition-for-proposing-taurus-missiles-ultimatum-for-russia/	2024-11-30T08:45:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147904710.jpg
Almost 40% of Russians think nuclear strike on Ukraine is justified, Russian sociologist says	Thirty-nine percent of Russians believe that &quot;the use of nuclear weapons could be justified&quot; during Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, Alexey Levinson, chief of the sociocultural research department at the Russian independent polling organization Levada Center, said at a conference on Nov. 29. Levinson cited a poll conducted by the Levada Center in November. The poll results haven&apos;t been published yet. According to this and previous polls, the number of people supporting Russia&apos;s potential use of nuclear weapons has grown incrementally over the past months, as Russia has further escalated its nuclear blackmail. In November, President Vladimir Putin approved the country&apos;s updated nuclear doctrine and threatened more attacks after the launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik&quot; designed for nuclear weapons on Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but the threats have failed to materialize. However, Putin&apos;s talks of a potential nuclear strike &quot;gradually lead to an increase in the proportion of (Russians) who believe it is acceptable, in fact, morally justified,&quot; Levinson said during the conference. According to the Levada Center polls, the percentage of Russians opposed to using nuclear weapons dropped from 52% in June to 45% in November. Polls conducted by the Levada Center throughout the war have found a consistent and overwhelming majority of Russians support Putin and believe the country is on the right path as it continues to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-40-of-russians-think-nuclear-strike-on-ukraine-is-justified-russian-sociologist-says/	2024-11-30T07:52:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2150601716.jpg
Russian general charged in absentia for ordering missile strike on Chernihiv theater in 2023	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) charged Russian Colonel-General Yevgeny Nikiforov in absentia for ordering a missile strike on a Chernihiv theater that killed seven people and wounded 200 in August 2023, the SBU announced on Nov. 30. The SBU charged Nikiforov, the commander of the &#x201C;West&#x201D; grouping of troops in the Russian Armed Forces, with &quot;violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder.&quot; Nearly 143,000 war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces since 2022, including strikes against civilian infrastructure and killing of civilians, are currently under investigation in Ukraine. While Ukrainian authorities are pushing for an international tribunal, bringing alleged Russian war criminals to trial for these crimes remains almost impossible during the ongoing war. Nikiforov ordered the missile strike on the Taras Shevchenko Chernihiv Regional Academic Music and Drama Theater that took place on Aug. 19, 2023, according to the SBU. Russian forces launched an Iskander-M cruise missile from Kursk Oblast in Russia. Seven people were killed, including a six-year-old child, and over 200 wounded. The large number of casualties is due to the theater&apos;s location in the city center and the timing of the attack which occurred in the daytime on a weekend. The explosion from the strike also damaged apartment buildings, administrative buildings, and cars. As of November 2023, Ukraine had charged 137 people for committing war crimes in Ukraine, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-general-charged-in-absentia-for-ordering-missile-strike-on-chernihiv-theater/	2024-11-30T06:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1610619059.jpg
Ukraine destroys 3 more Russian radar systems in Crimea, military intelligence claims	Ukraine destroyed three Russian high-value radar stations in Russian-occupied Crimea on Nov. 29, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 30. The radars include two 48Y6-K1 Podlet systems worth $5 million each and one Kasta-2E2 radar, estimated to cost around $30 million. Both Kasta and Podlet are modern mobile radar systems designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The report came just a day after HUR claimed to have struck another Podlet radar system in Crimea on Nov. 28. HUR claimed to be behind both operations but didn&apos;t provide details. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claims. Multiple explosions were reported across Crimea over the past week, with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in the occupied peninsula during the full-scale war. Russia occupied Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 before invading the east of the country in what marked the beginning of its aggression against modern-day Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-three-more-russian-radar-systems-in-crimea-military-intelligence-claims/	2024-11-30T03:42:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/462399914_3893767737532620_3969538192184221239_n.jpg
Ukraine downs 8 Russian drones, at least 2 killed and 6 wounded over the past day	Ukrainian air defenses shot down eight out of 10 Russian drones launched overnight on Nov. 30, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. Russia targeted Ukraine with Iranian-designed Shahed drones and an unspecified type of drone launched from the Russian oblasts of Kursk and Primorsko-Akhtarsk, according to the Air Force. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, and Kherson oblasts, the Air Force said. Russia has launched drone attacks against Ukraine daily in the past couple of months in what experts said was a tactic to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses ahead of larger-scale strikes targeting energy infrastructure ahead of winter. On Nov. 28, Russia launched more than 180 drones and missiles at Ukraine, striking a &quot;massive blow&quot; at Ukraine&apos;s power grid, according to the energy minister. No casualties were reported in relation to the overnight drone attack. Over the past day, at least two people were killed and six injured due to other attacks launched by Russia, local authorities reported. At least one person was killed and six others were wounded in Kherson Oblast over the past day, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. In Kharkiv Oblast, one man was killed in an aviation bomb attack on Kupiansk district, according to the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. According to the Air Force, Ukraine has detected a total of almost 1 million aerial targets in its airspace since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The number includes more than 175,000 cases of airplane detection, 100,000 helicopters, 57,000 drones, and more than 13,000 missiles of various types.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-8-russian-drones-at-least-2-killed-and-6-wounded-over-the-past-day/	2024-11-30T03:16:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg
West provided enough aid for 2.5 brigades out of requested 10, Zelensky says	Western allies provided enough aid to fully equip only 2.5 out of the 10 Ukrainian brigades that Ukraine had requested support for, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News published on Nov. 29. &quot;Just equip the brigades,&quot; Zelensky said in response to the question on what NATO or the U.S. could do to help tackle Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. The statement follows media reports suggesting that Washington is urging Ukraine to lower its minimum mobilization age from 25 to 18 in an effort to replenish military ranks. Kyiv said that Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization strategy is regularly discussed with allies but dismissed suggestions of tension over the issue. In the interview with Sky News, Zelensky said that if the West doesn&apos;t provide enough aid, &#xA0;Ukraine will &quot;never have enough resources.&quot; &quot;How do you want me just to mobilize young guys, [as] they don&apos;t know where to go &#x2013; in which brigade, with which weapon they will fight?&quot; he added. &quot;They speak about mobilization, but the real problem [is] with 10 brigades which our partners didn&apos;t equip.&quot; Zelensky said that he had asked the U.S. and Europe to help equip the Ukrainian brigades over a year ago. He cited bureaucracy and allies&apos; other priorities as reasons why the aid hasn&apos;t been fully provided. Zelensky also said the control over the situation in the east of Ukraine is solely dependant on these brigades. In the interview on July 4, Zelensky said that 14 Ukrainian brigades were underarmed as the Western aid was arriving too slowly. Ukraine has been steadily losing ground in the east the past months, as Russia has ramped up assaults in multiple areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-provided-enough-aid-for-2-5-brigades-out-of-requested-10-zelensky-says/	2024-11-30T02:00:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg

North Korea’s Kim pledges unwavering support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, media reports	North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country will &quot;invariably support&quot; Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia&#x2019;s defense chief, North Korean state media reported Nov. 30. A Russian military delegation, led by Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, arrived in North Korea on Nov. 29. The visit has raised international concerns over deepening ties between the two nations, particularly following North Korea&#x2019;s deployment of thousands of troops to Russia last month. The Korean Central News Agency said that Kim and Belousov reached &quot;a satisfactory consensus&quot; on strengthening their strategic partnership and safeguarding each nation&#x2019;s sovereignty, security interests, and international justice amid evolving global security challenges. Kim emphasized that North Korea &quot;will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists&#x2019; moves for hegemony,&quot; according to KCNA. North Korea has framed Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine as a defensive measure against what both Moscow and Pyongyang describe as NATO&#x2019;s &quot;reckless&quot; expansion and U.S.-led efforts to undermine Russia&#x2019;s global standing.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-kim-pledges-unwavering-support-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-media-reports/	2024-11-29T21:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175735683.jpg
Woman receives 15-year sentence for aiding Russian strikes on Zhytomyr Oblast	A Ukrainian court has sentenced a 43-year-old woman to 15 years in prison for aiding Russian military operations and attempting to flee to Russia. The woman, originally from Donetsk, relocated to Kyiv and later rented an apartment in Zhytomyr Oblast after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. According to Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU), the woman made contact with Russia&apos;s defense intelligence agency (GRU) via social media, offering to serve as an informant. She also used her personal account on the banned Odnoklassniki platform to praise Wagner Group militants and justify their crimes. Once recruited by the GRU, the woman was assigned an operational alias and given instructions to gather intelligence on Ukrainian military infrastructure, specifically the locations of repair bases for heavy weapons. She transferred the &#xA0;information to her Russian handlers via encrypted messenger chats and email. Authorities arrested the woman in August 2023 while she was preparing to flee to Russia. The SBU uncovered plans for her to be &quot;evacuated&quot; through third countries by the GRU. The court convicted her under two articles of the Ukrainian Criminal Code: Part 2 of Article 111 (treason during martial law) and Part 2 of Article 436-2 (justification of Russian aggression and glorification of its participants). The case highlights ongoing efforts by Ukraine to combat espionage and subversive activities linked to Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/woman-receives-15-year-sentence-for-aiding-russian-strikes-on-zhytomyr-oblast/	2024-11-29T19:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-857697192.jpg
Ukrainian poet Myroslav Herasymovych killed on front line	Ukrainian poet, prose writer, and screenwriter Myroslav Herasymovych was killed in action on Nov. 25 in Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, according to his brother&#x2019;s Facebook post. Herasymovych, born in Lutsk on 29 November 1967, died just days before his 57th birthday. He was a graduate of the Taras Shevchenko National University&apos;s Faculty of Journalism. &quot;In the battle with Russia, my brother, Myroslav, gave away his life in the city of Avdiivka,&#x201D; his brother Taras Kulyk shared. Over 100 Ukrainian artists have been killed since 2022, according to the writer&#x2019;s association PEN Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-poet-myroslav-herasymovych-killed-on-front-line/	2024-11-29T16:58:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/myroslav.jpg
Foreign Ministry condemns Georgian response to demonstrations as second night of protests in Tbilisi continues	The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) condemned Georgian authorities&#x2019; aggressive response against protestors in Tbilisi, according to a statement released on Nov. 29. &quot;Ukraine strongly condemns the use of force against a peaceful protest in Tbilisi. We urge the Georgian authorities to respect the right of Georgian citizens to peaceful protest and refrain from violence and provocations,&quot; the MFA wrote. The MFA&#x2019;s statement also expressed disappointment with Georgia&apos;s decision to suspend European Union accession talks until 2028. For the second night in a row, Georgian authorities have aggressively dispersed peaceful protests in Tbilisi using tear gas, water cannons, and pepper spray, drawing strong international condemnation. The protests followed Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s statement that Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union could be postponed until 2028, prompting outrage among some in society, who are demanding changes in the country&apos;s political course. The ruling Georgian Dream party led by Kobakhidze has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. The MFA also highlighted concerns about Georgia appeasing Moscow at the expense of its people&apos;s European aspirations. &#x201C;It is no coincidence that the Georgian leadership has already received public praise from the Kremlin for actions contrary to the European aspirations of its people,&#x201D; the statement said.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-condemns-georgian-response-to-demonstrations-as-second-night-of-protests-in-tbilisi-continues/	2024-11-29T14:39:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/georgia--1-.jpg
8 Ukrainian children return home from Russian-occupied territories	Eight Ukrainian children have been successfully returned from temporarily occupied territories, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Nov. 29. The children, aged 6 to 16, were returned from Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk Oblasts, as well as Crimea. This effort was part of the &#x201C;Bring Kids Back UA&#x201D; initiative. Seven children were assisted by Qatar, and one through a humanitarian corridor. Qatar acts as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. Some of the children endured severe hardships, including a girl with neurological conditions in Crimea who lacked access to medical care. These children are now receiving medical and psychological support and reuniting with their families in Ukraine. &#x201C;The return of these children is a step towards restoring justice and hope,&#x201D; Yermak wrote on Telegram. According to the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s database, Russia has illegally abducted over 19,500 children since February 2022, and less than 390 have returned home thus far. Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-ukrainian-children-return-home-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2024-11-29T13:40:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1247413769.jpg
Trump's pick for Ukraine envoy backs 'peace through strength,' security guarantees	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s Nov. 27 decision to choose Keith Kellogg as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia is not ideal for Kyiv but is an acceptable and reasonable choice for Ukraine, analysts say. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. At the same time, Kellogg has stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The plan does not stipulate a reduction in the Ukrainian army&apos;s size or recognizing occupied territories as Russian de jure. &quot;There will be no (outright) pro-Ukrainian appointments (under Trump),&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But it&apos;s good if an appointee is not anti-Ukrainian.&quot; He argued that Kellogg is not anti-Ukrainian and that he is an experienced and competent professional. In contrast with Kellogg, Trump&apos;s nomination of Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Pete Hegseth for defense secretary was met with unease in Kyiv. &quot;From this standpoint, if you compare (Kellogg) with others, he&apos;s absolutely acceptable for Ukraine,&quot; Fesenko added. &quot;His position is understandable (for Kyiv), and we can adapt to it.&quot; Kellogg is a retired lieutenant general who served in the Vietnam War and the Gulf War and was the chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq from 2003 to 2004. During Trump&apos;s first presidency, Kellogg was the chief of staff of the National Security Council from 2017 to 2018 and national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence from 2018 to 2021. &quot;General Kellogg is very devoted to President Trump, having been with him in all three campaigns plus his time in office, but in my experience, he is a serious guy,&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, director of research in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. Daniel Hamilton, another foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, also described Kellogg as &quot;an experienced military leader&quot; and &quot;a strong supporter of President Trump.&quot; US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Keith Kellogg (R) after announcing him as chief of staff to national security adviser US Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, US on Feb. 20, 2017. (Nicholas Kamm / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Kellogg is close to the president, which is a prerequisite for an effective special envoy. He&apos;s also considered to be thoughtful and measured &#x2026; and is obviously experienced,&quot; Peter Rough, director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the conservative Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said &quot;it&apos;s important that any such envoy has &apos;the ear&apos; of the president and conversely is seen to genuinely represent/speak for Trump.&quot; &quot;In making deals, that&apos;s almost more important than any previous policy position Kellogg has had because people can then to some degree trust that what he says will also hold with Trump,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Kellogg co-chairs the Center on American Security at the America First Policy Institute. In May, Kellogg and another Trump advisor, Frederick Fleitz, co-authored a report called An America First Approach to U.S. National Security for the America First Policy Institute. Among other things, the report presents their vision for a peace settlement in Ukraine. In June, Reuters reported that Kellogg and Fleitz had proposed to Trump a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. Hamilton argued that &quot;Kellogg is essentially coming in (to Ukraine) to implement his proposal.&quot; &quot;As someone who has helped draft a proposal for seeking a diplomatic end to the war, Kellogg is poised to push hard to fulfill Trump&apos;s pledge to bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table,&quot; Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I expect a determined diplomatic effort to bring the war to an end very early in Trump&apos;s presidency.&quot; Kellogg&apos;s plan, as outlined in his report, envisages freezing the current front line in Ukraine. According to the plan, Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession would be taken off the table for &quot;an extended period.&quot; The strategy includes partially lifting the Western sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace. &quot;If Ukraine doesn&apos;t want to negotiate, fine, but then accept the fact that you can have enormous losses in your cities and accept the fact that you will have your children killed, accept the fact that you don&apos;t have 130,000 dead, you will have 230,000&#x2013;250,000,&quot; Kellogg told the Voice of America in July. &quot;Demographically, what does that do to the country?&quot; The paper by Kellogg and Fleitz also repeatedly referenced the unsubstantiated theory that NATO expansion triggered Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which Trump also mentioned in an interview in June. On the upside, Kellogg&apos;s plan envisages levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. According to his strategy, Ukraine will not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all the territories. The strategy also calls for &quot;a comprehensive and verifiable peace deal with security guarantees.&quot; The plan stipulates that, if Ukraine agrees to peace talks, the U.S. would continue sending military aid to Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking it. On the other hand, the U.S. would increase its military support for Ukraine if Russia refuses to accept a peace deal. Kellogg has also made a number of statements that appear to favor Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;ve said very clearly in our paper that Ukraine has fought valiantly,&quot; he told the Voice of America. &quot;They are very well led. We think the Russians did clearly an unwarranted invasion of a sovereign state, and this must be addressed.&quot; Kellogg also said that &quot;you want to make sure that Ukrainians are not put at the position when they&apos;re operating from weaknesses, but from strength.&quot; &quot;Nobody is ever saying that: &apos;Oh, we just have to make Ukrainians give up land and give it to Russia,&apos;&quot; he continued. &quot;If the West had provided the equipment that (President Volodymyr) Zelensky asked for, then you probably could have finished the job. You could have gotten into the Sea of Azov through Kherson, splitting them in half, and that is what you wanted to do. So, I blame (U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s) administration and the West to a degree for not supporting Ukraine when they should have,&quot; Kellogg said.

(Dmytro Larin /Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)He lambasted the Biden administration for failing to provide F-16 fighters, tanks, and long-range weapons quickly enough and in sufficient quantities and to allow Ukraine to &quot;shoot deep into Russia.&quot; &quot;You have to give more arms to them because you can&apos;t trust the Russians,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;Sometimes you have to look at what we call in America the long game. And that is security guarantees, financial support, and military support.&quot; To guarantee Ukraine&apos;s security, he suggested concluding a &quot;defense agreement&quot; with Kyiv similar to the U.S. accords with South Korea and Taiwan. Kellogg also said that Russia&apos;s demand for Ukraine&apos;s demilitarization and a reduction in the size of its army was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; The Ukrainian authorities reacted positively to Kellogg&apos;s nomination. &quot;Keith Kellogg is not a new person for Ukraine. The Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S. has maintained close ties with him, particularly within the framework of expert diplomacy in recent years, and has developed and maintained a good dialogue with him during this time,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent that Kellogg &quot;should recognize the only way to have successful negotiations is to make Ukraine as strong as possible &#x2014; peace through strength.&quot; &quot;That means continuing aid and getting Congress to pass another assistance package,&quot; he added. &quot;(Kellogg) seems like a reasonable choice,&quot; Roland Paris, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa and a research associate at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He has emphasized the importance of Ukraine negotiating from a position of strength, he seems to understand the threat that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin poses, and he has underscored the importance of providing Ukraine with ironclad U.S. security guarantees, along the lines of the U.S. commitment to South Korea, following any eventual peace negotiation.&quot; Hamilton said Kellogg is &quot;an experienced military professional, not a loose cannon.&quot; &quot;This means the exact nature of U.S. pressure, or the contours of any ceasefire, may evolve,&quot; he added. O&apos;Hanlon said that he was &quot;more hopeful by this choice than&quot; he would have been if it had been Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany, who was reportedly among the candidates for the job. He said he hopes Kellogg will help Ukraine to achieve peace from a position of strength. Fesenko agreed, saying that &quot;Grenell is more radical and more inclined to apply strong pressure (to Ukraine),&quot; while &quot;Kellogg is more pragmatic.&quot; Keith Kellogg, former national security advisor, during the America First Policy Institute&apos;s America First Agenda summit in Washington, D.C., US, on July 25, 2022. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Reuters reported on Nov. 22 that Trump was considering appointing Grenell as his special envoy for Ukraine. Grenell, who served as the acting director of national intelligence during Trump&apos;s first term, is seen as an isolationist and supporter of reducing military aid to Ukraine. Back in 2022, Grenell said he &quot;applauded&quot; billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s peace proposal but added that he would like a &quot;stronger (peace) deal.&quot; Musk prompted a scandal the same year by suggesting a peace plan that included Ukraine&apos;s neutral status, recognizing Crimea as Russian, and holding a UN-supervised vote on the status of other occupied territories. In July 2024, Grenell also proposed creating &quot;autonomous zones&quot; in Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia. He did not elaborate but the statement was an apparent reference to autonomous zones in the Russian-occupied territories. Even if Kellogg pushes for a pro-Ukrainian peace deal, it is unclear whether Trump will back him. Fleitz said in July that Trump had reacted positively to the peace proposal by him and Kellogg but said he was not claiming that Trump agreed with every word of it. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung emphasized then that only statements from Trump or his campaign should be taken as official policy positions. &quot;It is Trump, not Kellogg, who will make decisions,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Kellogg is just an instrument.&quot; &quot;And will Putin agree (to Kellogg&apos;s proposals)? I doubt it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pick-for-ukraine-envoy-backs-peace-through-strength-security-guarantees/	2024-11-29T13:15:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky suggests ending 'hot phase' of war in exchange for NATO membership without occupied territories	Key developments on Nov. 29: To end the &quot;hot phase of the war,&quot; NATO would have to offer membership to Ukrainian territory under government control, with the invitation recognizing the country&apos;s internationally recognized borders, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News &quot;If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should quickly take under NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That&apos;s what we need to do first, and then Ukraine can get back the other parts of its territory in a diplomatic way,&quot; Zelensky said during the interview, which was published on Nov. 29. According to the president, Kyiv has never considered such a proposal, since &quot;no one has ever offered that to us officially.&quot; Donald Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s war effort. He criticized U.S. military support provided to Ukraine by Joe Biden&apos;s administration. Some reports also indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Zelensky&apos;s latest remarks are somewhat at odds with his previous statements. He said that the signals of Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO in parts is &quot;nonsense,&quot; and Ukraine &quot;will never exchange any status for any of our territories.&quot; The president&apos;s comments to Sky News imply that territories currently occupied by Russia would not fall under the &quot;NATO umbrella&quot; in this scenario. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions in 2022 despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, and destroyed a Buk-M3 radar station in Russian-occupied territories in Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said on Nov. 29. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, and oil refineries. The Ukrainian military said that on the night of Nov. 29, they struck the Atlas oil depot in Rostov Oblast. As a result of the strike, fires broke out on the territory of the facility, the statement said. According to the General Staff, Atlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex, and supplies petroleum products to the Russian army. The oil depot was previously targeted in the summer of 2024. Elsewhere, a radar station of the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system was destroyed in the Russian-held part of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukrainian forces stationed near the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast will be additionally supplied with reserves, ammunition, weapons, and military equipment, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 29. Prior to the statement, Syrskyi visited Ukrainian units in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions of the front line. &quot;The main goal is to personally talk to the commanders who are directly engaged in combat, to solve problematic issues, and provide comprehensive assistance,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on his Telegram channel. &quot;We continue to deter the enemy and inflict heavy losses in manpower and equipment. I am grateful to our soldiers for their resilience and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor.&quot; Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed General Mykhailo Drapatyi as Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces commander, the president announced on Nov. 29. Drapatyi replaced Oleksandr Pavliuk who has served in the position since Feb. 11, 2024 after then Ground Forces Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi had been appointed commander-in-chief of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. &quot;Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi successfully organized the defense in the Kharkiv sector and disrupted the Russian offensive,&quot; Zelensky said on social media, without elaborating on the reason for the reshuffle. Drapatyi, 42, served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016 to 2019. He also played one of the key roles in the liberation of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2014. Drapatyi has headed the &quot;Kharkiv&quot; operational grouping of troops since this May and &quot;Luhansk&quot; operational and tactical group of forces since September. In February, Drapatyi was appointed as deputy chief of the General Staff. Zelensky also appointed Oleh Apostol, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s 95th Separate Air Assault Brigade, as deputy commander-in-chief of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Apostol, 37, participated in combat operations in Ukraine&apos;s east after Russia&apos;s invasion in 2014 and liberated settlements in southern Mykolaiv Oblast after the beginning of the all-out war in 2022. He is a holder of the Hero of Ukraine award. &quot;Both have proven their effectiveness in combat,&quot; the president said. The reshuffle came at a critical time for Ukraine, as Moscow&apos;s forces make their fastest gains in months and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;The Ukrainian army needs internal changes to fully achieve the goals of our state,&quot; Zelensky added. Russia&apos;s daily losses in Ukraine surpassed 2,000 for the first time, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 29. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Moscow&apos;s troops lost 2,030 men over the preceding day. This surpasses the previous record of 1,950 set on Nov. 12. The total figure stands at 738,660. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Ukraine has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties. &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowleded only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. But estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26 said between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-46/	2024-11-29T11:46:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-2.jpg

Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 but has yet to receive a formal invitation. Despite high expectations in Kyiv, the last two allied summits brought only new steps toward deepening Ukraine-NATO cooperation and a declaration that the country&apos;s membership path is &quot;irreversible.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-suggests/	2024-11-29T11:31:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg

‘For some it’s a game, for me it’s a manifesto’ — Ukrainian soldiers join S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 frenzy	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, most soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names or callsigns only. One soldier is mentioned by first and last name as he is permitted to use his full name with the press. Ihor was glued to his computer past 1 a.m. playing &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x201D; after the mega-hit video game was released on Nov. 20. But unlike most of the estimated million and a half players around the world who downloaded the Ukrainian game in its first week, the young Ukrainian fighter was interrupted when he had to leave his glowing screen and camouflaged safe house for a nighttime combat mission. &#x201C;Many locations (in the game) are similar to real places where fighting took place. They spark memories,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent from the front lines. &#x201C;Burnt-out houses, abandoned factories or industrial facilities, abandoned buildings in general. Even just locations with fallen trees and scorched land.&#x201D; The long-awaited release of &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl&#x201D; has been one of the biggest gaming events of the year. The game, developed by the Ukrainian company GSC Game World, quickly shot up to the top spot of global video game sales, with players of the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter game roaming a fictionalized Chornobyl exclusion zone with a weapon in their hand. Nowhere has this cultural phenomenon been more pronounced than in Ukraine, where the game&#x2019;s release was marked by congratulatory remarks in parliament, viral cross-promotion campaigns, and memes that the U.S. embassy&#x2019;s closure that day due to a security threat was really so its employees could download &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.&#x201D; A screenshot from &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,&#x201D; the post-apocalyptic video game created by Ukrainian company GSC Game World released on Nov. 20. (GSC Game World)But for members of the Ukrainian military, &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x201D; is more than just a game &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a way to wind down from the stress of combat and a source of national pride. Shooting enemies in a virtual Ukrainian landscape may seem like a surprising way for soldiers to relax, but &#x201C;I always clearly understand where the game is and where it is not,&#x201D; said Ihor. &#x201C;In these games, I do everything the same as in life, but without the fear of dying. It helps me accept traumatic experiences and realize that this is the past, and it needs to be let go.&#x201D; &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t feel the war through the monitor,&#x201D; said Evhen, a reconnaissance drone pilot in the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, who goes by the callsign &#x201C;Teacher.&#x201D; &#x201C;The game helps me relax and take a break from everything around me.&#x201D; When the game was released, Evhen was at a front-line position, excited to return to his base so he could download it. &#x201C;Several of my brothers-in-arms also bought the game. We only play at the base on rest days, not so much on combat missions,&#x201D; the drone pilot said. &#x201C;This game is our phenomenon, our pride.&#x201D; &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x201D; is the fourth release in the cult-classic S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, produced by Ukraine&#x2019;s most famous video game company GSC Game World. The series is so popular among soldiers that many have chosen &#x201C;Stalker&#x201D; as their callsign, including four fighters who died in battle. While the first three games in the series have already been played by millions, &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x201D; took on deeper significance after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Just ahead of an expected April 2022 release date, the new game was delayed indefinitely as GSC Game World employees suddenly faced displacement, Russian attacks, and blackouts. Some employees joined the Armed Forces, including Volodymyr Yezhov, a developer on the earlier S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games who was killed during the Battle of Bakhmut in Dec. 2022. From a new office in Prague, the game&#x2019;s creators had to build new motion capture and audio recording studios from scratch and restart their voiceover recording with new actors. They changed the game&#x2019;s name to use the Ukrainian spelling of Chornobyl rather than the Russian version, &#x201C;Chernobyl.&#x201D; They also removed Russian voiceovers and have refused to sell the game in Russia, sparking Russian threats and frequent hacking attempts. Now, the game opens with a message from its creators, dedicating it &#x201C;to all who have defended and are defending Ukraine. To everyone who made today possible. Eternal memory to all who have been taken by this war.&#x201D; But gaming at the frontline isn&#x2019;t always easy, and the powerful hardware needed to run &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&#x201D; can place it out of reach for soldiers packing light. One fighter in the 102nd Territorial Defense Brigade who uses the callsign &#x201C;Shtopor&#x201D; (&#x201C;Corkscrew&#x201D;) describes himself as a &#x201C;huge fan&#x201D; of the series &#x2014; he played the first three games several times as a kid, and even his ringtone is from the franchise. In more peaceful times, when the game was scheduled to come out in April 2022, Shtopor paid for a brand-new PC on credit so that he&#x2019;d be able to play the game. Instead, a month later, he was serving in the military carrying a laptop too weak to run the software. &#x201C;By coincidence, I even ended up with the same weapon as the main hero at the start of the game&#x201D; in his favorite part in the series: an AK-74U. The protagonist wields a weapon in a screenshot from &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,&quot; set in a fictionalized Chornobyl exclusion zone.

Still, &#x201C;the experience of the game is unlikely to help in real life,&#x201D; he noted from his position in Zaporizhzhia. &#x201C;In S.T.A.L.K.E.R., there aren&#x2019;t mortar or artillery shells. Or drones, either.&#x201D; Shtopor isn&#x2019;t the only fighter who bought a new computer for this game. &#x201C;Gringo,&#x201D; an anti-tank specialist in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, bought his gaming laptop&#x2019;s most powerful model ahead of the new &#x201C;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&#x201D; release. With his brigade currently recovering near Kherson, he said he spends &#x201C;nearly all&#x201D; of his free time gaming. Some in his brigade who don&#x2019;t have the right equipment will often watch highlight reels of clips from the game on TikTok, he added. &#x201C;The weapons in my hands behave very much like the weapons in the game. They perfectly conveyed the most realistic shooting,&#x201D; he said, echoing comments from other fighters. Like others who spoke with the Kyiv Independent, he also pointed out the frequent bugs in the game, an issue raised in most early reviews of the release. But the bugs were beside the point, many said. One fighter even noted that he and his friends jokingly compare glitches they discover. Glitches &#x2014; a common complaint during new video game releases &#x2014; are usually fixed with downloadable patches as developers update games. GSC Game World recently released a patch incorporating player feedback. One thing that strikes most players of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is how much care its creators have taken to infuse the game with Ukrainian details &#x2014; from a soundtrack containing hours of contemporary Ukrainian music to small accents like the blue-and-yellow matchboxes recognizable in most Ukrainian households and made by the Ukrainian Match Factory. Mykyta Poturaiev, chair of parliament&#x2019;s Humanitarian and Information Policy Committee, said that &#x201C;in the modern world, computer games are a very powerful tool for conveying information about oneself and one&#x2019;s country.&#x201D; When it became clear that the game had caused real international resonance, he helped organize a &#x201C;spontaneous&#x201D; celebration of the game during a plenary meeting in parliament the next day. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. release celebration during a plenary meeting in parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 21, 2024. (Goreniuk Oleksandr / Facebook)&#x201C;This is a very powerful message to the world &#x2014; that Ukraine and Ukrainians, even during such deadly struggles, do not give up. They are able to produce world-class products,&#x201D; Poturaiev said. Petro Shuklinov remembers the 2007 first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game as &#x201C;legendary&#x201D; when he was growing up. In Kyiv, where the former war correspondent is now stationed as an active service member, he downloaded the newest release as soon as it came out. Shuklinov said part of what makes the game so meaningful to fighters is that it reminds them of their childhood: &#x201C;As we keep this child within ourselves in our memories, our struggle makes sense.&#x201D; &#x201C;And how much Ukrainian pain (the game) holds! No one will see this pain,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Unless they hear it on the radio in the game, where our songs are played.&#x201D; &#x201C;But I see this pain in every pixel. For some, it&apos;s just a game,&#x201D; said Shuklinov. &#x201C;But for me, it&apos;s a manifesto: we are here, we are alive, we continue to fight.&#x201D; Kyiv Independent reporter Natalia Yermak contributed reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-some-its-a-game-for-me-its-a-manifesto-ukrainian-soldiers-join-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-frenzy/	2024-11-29T10:35:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/S2HoC_GSCGameWorld_Mill_raw.jpg
Ukraine urges NATO to issue membership invitation next week, Reuters reports	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha asked his NATO counterparts to invite Ukraine to join the alliance during a meeting in Brussels next week, Reuters reported on Nov. 29, citing a letter received. &quot;I urge you to endorse the decision to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance as one of the outcomes of the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on Dec. 3-4,&quot; Sybiha wrote. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to Sybiha, a NATO invitation will become &quot;the Allies&apos; adequate response to Russia&apos;s constant escalation of the war it has unleashed.&quot; He mentioned &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of North Korean soldiers involved in the full-scale war and a recent attack against Ukraine with Oreshnik, Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). &quot;We believe that the invitation should be extended at this stage,&quot; the minister wrote. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, said that Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends. However, inviting Kyiv to the alliance now would demonstrate to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he failed to achieve one of his main goals &#x2014; to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO, Reuters reported, citing the letter. In mid-October, Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said in October that the alliance does not currently have such plans.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-urges-nato-to-issue-membership-invitation-next-week-reuters-reports/	2024-11-29T09:49:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Ukraine receives $100 million loan for budget expenses from South Korea	Ukraine has received $100 million as part of a loan from South Korea for budget assistance, the first time the country is providing aid to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 29. According to Shmyhal, the funds will be devoted to Ukraine&apos;s social sector by supporting budget expenses. In April of this year, Kyiv and Seoul signed an agreement enabling Ukraine to attract up to $2.1 billion in concessional loans over 2024-2029. The loan has a term of 20 years with an annual interest rate 1.0% and a five-year grace period. Later in October, Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko signed a loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of Korea to attract the $100 million loan. Ukraine faces a $35 billion budget deficit in 2025, and with Russia&#x2019;s war continuing into its third year with no end in sight, the country has to rely on external financing to sustain its economy and war effort. South Korea has provided Ukraine with humanitarian aid throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war but not with lethal assistance, as the country&apos;s legislation prevents direct arms supplies to war zones. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Nov. 27 visited South Korea and met with the country&apos;s President Yoon Suk Yeol as Russian forces make their fastest gains in months and thousands of North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Although the South Korean president did not rule out supplying arms to Ukraine, there were no official announcements that Seoul had changed its stance after the visit of the Ukrainian delegation. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. A South Korean official recently said that direct supplies of 155 mm ammunition are not on the table.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-provides-100-million-in-aid-for-ukraine/	2024-11-29T08:58:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/korea.jpeg
Zelensky appoints new Ground Forces of Ukraine commander	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed General Mykhailo Drapatyi as Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces commander, the president announced on Nov. 29. Drapatyi is expected to replace Oleksandr Pavliuk who has served in the position since Feb. 11, 2024. &quot;Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi successfully organized the defense in the Kharkiv sector and disrupted the Russian offensive,&quot; Zelensky said on social media, without elaborating on the reason for the reshuffle. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016-2019. He has headed the &quot;Kharkiv&quot; operational grouping of troops since this May and &quot;Luhansk&quot; operational and tactical group of forces since September.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-new-ground-forces-commander/	2024-11-29T07:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-29-170402.png
North Korea has given Russia more than 100 ballistic missiles, 5 million artillery shells, Ukraine says	North Korea has supplied Russia with more than 100 short-range ballistic missiles, and 5 million artillery shells, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Nov. 29. In comments to Interfax-Ukraine, HUR also said Pyongyang had begun supplying Moscow with artillery systems last month. &quot;In total, over 100 pieces of various equipment have been transferred, including 170-mm M-1989 self-propelled artillery systems, and 240-mm M-1991 multiple rocket launchers,&quot; it said. &quot;Additionally, North Korea continues to supply Russia with large-calibre artillery ammunition and short-range ballistic missiles of the Kn-23/24 type.&quot; HUR added that as of this month, over 5 million artillery rounds and 100 artillery shells have been delivered. On the same day, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for an official visit amid deepening military cooperation between the two countries. Belousov&apos;s visit to Pyongyang comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s state visit to the hermit country in June, where Russia formally deepened it military and economic cooperation with Pyongyang. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-has-given-russia-more-than-100-ballistic-missiles-5-million-artillery-shells-ukraine-says/	2024-11-29T06:45:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
Syrskyi orders deployment of more reserves to Pokrovsk, Kurakhove directions in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian forces stationed near the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast will be additionally supplied with reserves, ammunition, weapons, and military equipment, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 29. Prior to the statement, Syrskyi visited Ukrainian units in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions of the front line. &quot;The main goal is to personally talk to the commanders who are directly engaged in combat, to solve problematic issues and provide comprehensive assistance,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on his Telegram channel. &quot;We continue to deter the enemy and inflict heavy losses in manpower and equipment. I am grateful to our soldiers for their resilience and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor.&quot; Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms are not flowing in as fast as Kyiv has hoped. The outgoing Biden administration seeks to speed up materiel deliveries before Trump takes office. Washington has provided Ukraine&apos;s forces with new capabilities to stall the Russian advance, such as long-range strikes on Russian territory or anti-personnel mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrsky-orders-to-deploy-more-reserves-to-pokrovsk-kurakhove-directions-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-29T05:57:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-29-15_33_32.jpeg
Ukraine retrieves bodies of 502 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 502 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Nov. 29. The Geneva Conventions stipulate that those who lose their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. As of early March, Ukraine has identified more than 2,800 bodies and body fragments of fallen soldiers, according to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. The bodies of 397 soldiers were recovered from Donetsk Oblast, while 64 were brought back from Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and 24 from Luhansk Oblast. Another 17 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify those killed,&quot; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The operation to recover the fallen soldiers involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. On Nov. 8, the bodies of 563 fallen Ukrainian soldiers were returned to Ukraine. Meanwhile, on Oct. 18, the bodies of 501 Ukrainian troops were also retrieved. In late February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-502-fallen-soldiers/	2024-11-29T05:28:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175211787.jpg
Turkey won't support peace plan with territorial concessions, Ukrainian lawmaker says	Turkey won&apos;t support a peace plan that involves freezing the war in Ukraine and Kyiv making territorial concessions to Moscow, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 29, citing Ukrainian lawmaker Ahtem Chiygoz. Chiygoz earlier took part in a meeting of the friendship groups of the parliaments of Ukraine and Turkey in Ankara. During the event, Turkish officials expressed support for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula, Chiygoz said. &quot;There are constant accusations, especially from the Russian side, that Turkey is committed to a peace formula that involves freezing the conflict and concessions in territorial integrity,&quot; he added. &quot;During our two-day visit to Turkey, we held meetings at a very high level and were assured everywhere that this was not true.&quot; Turkey supports Ukraine in many ways, and both countries are interested in developing bilateral strategic relations, including parliamentary cooperation, according to the lawmaker. &quot;Turkey not only has hopes but is working to ensure that the changes after the elections in America do not affect the provision of assistance to Ukraine. These were important messages for us. And we will convey them to the authorities and people of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;This visit has also become the basis for our bilateral cooperation to be closer, and the role of our parliaments in it will now be more active.&quot; On Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources, that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks. Erdogan&apos;s proposal reportedly included Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal came as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The Kremlin on Nov. 18 dismissed a peace plan for Ukraine reportedly to be put forward by Erdogan, describing it as &quot;unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-assures-that-it-wont-support-peace-plan-with-territorial-concessions-lawmaker-says/	2024-11-29T05:24:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
2 Ukrainian journalists came under Russian fire in Kharkiv Oblast	Two journalists from the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske came under Russian attack in Kharkiv Oblast on Nov. 25 while filming a story about volunteers evacuating abandoned horses. Journalists Ksiusha Savoskina and Oleksii Nikulin went to film the evacuation of animals together with volunteers from Kharkiv Animal Rescue at an abandoned farm on the left bank of the Kupiansk district, Hromadske reported on Nov. 28. The group was accompanied by a soldier, as he had spotted the horses from the Ukrainian forces&apos; positions. As the evacuation of the horses began, a Russian drone appeared overhead, forcing everyone inside a building. Later, an explosion occurred &#x2014; the car, along with the journalists&apos; backpack containing lenses for filming, were destroyed as a result of the attack. &quot;Since then, we tried not to leave the hangar. The volunteers were supposed to put the horses in a trailer, and we decided that we would not leave (the hangar) the whole day until it got dark because it was very dangerous &#x2014; (the Russians) had probably already spotted us,&quot; Savoskina said. Another explosion also set a neighboring building on fire. The journalist suggested that Russian forces might have dropped a mine on it. &quot;Despite this, everyone remained healthy. The horses are also unharmed &#x2014; they are now in Kharkiv, then they will be transported to a children&apos;s equestrian school,&quot; Savoskina said. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&#x2019;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-ukrainian-journalists-came-under-russian-fire-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2024-11-29T04:55:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114144.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko threatens internet shutdown in case of protests during 2025 elections	Thirty-eight Russian combat drones enter Belarus on Nov. 24-25, marking the most significant overnight incursion so far and nearing the previous monthly record. Alexander Lukashenko threatens to shut down the internet in Belarus should protests occur during the 2025 presidential election. A Belarusian who fought on behalf of Ukraine as a volunteer against Russia faces over 20 years of prison time or potentially a death penalty under Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime after being denied residence in the EU and extradited from Vietnam to Belarus. Lukashenko &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; 32 more political prisoners in the sixth round of releases. The total count so far: 178 people released, yet 223 newly recognized political prisoners were added, Viasna reported. Seven hundred Belarusian activists, journalists, and Kastus Kalinouski Regiment volunteers were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted list. Thirty-eight Russian Shahed-type kamikaze drones flew into Belarus overnight on Nov. 24-25, marking an absolute record of daily incursions, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. As Russia continues to intensify its drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, incursions of Russian drones into Belarus surged from infrequent, isolated instances in July to 27 stray drones spotted over Belarus in September. The daily incursions record runs up close to a monthly total of 49 incursions recorded in October. Belarusian aviation scrambled to intercept the UAVs four times, shutting down at least one, Belarusian Hajun says. Dozens of drones crossed through the so-called &#x201C;Belarusian corridor,&#x201D; a narrow strip of Belarusian territory sandwiched between the Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts of Ukraine. In an attack on Nov. 24-25, Russia launched a total of 145 drones at Ukrainian targets overnight, with Ukrainian air defenses downing 71 of the attack drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. The official Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2014; its key ally &#x2014; over the reported drone incidents. Belarusian authorities have confirmed downing a Russian drone over its territory for the first time on Sept. 5.

(Roman Petushkov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. He did not provide evidence of Ukrainian drone incursions. The Belarusian Hajun group dismissed the claims as false. Over the past six months, 700 Belarusian activists, journalists, and volunteers fighting on Ukraine&#x2019;s side were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted list, Mediazona Belarus reported on Nov. 26. Belarus and Russia are part of the Interstate Wanted Persons Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent States or CIS, the Russian-led political alliance of former post-Soviet countries. In February 2024, the Russian Interior Ministry wanted list was first found to include over 3,100 Belarusian citizens. The new additions to the list include Pavel Shurmei and Dzianis Prokharau, current and former commanders of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment fighting in Ukraine, as well as recently arrested in Vietnam Vasil Verameichyk, the regiment&#x2019;s former member. Investigative journalists of the Media Bureau project and Belarusian Investigative Center have been added to the database along with journalists from Polish-backed Belsat, sports media Tribuna, former head of the Belarusian service Radio Liberty, journalist Alexander Lukashuk. In 2022 alone, Russia extradited 16 Belarusians accused of &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; &#x2014; a charge widely used against political opponents of Lukashenko. In February, then-Belarusian Ambassador to Russia Dzmitry Krutoy, who is currently heading Lukashenko&#x2019;s administration, claimed that Minsk and Moscow were unifying the &#x201C;lists of extremists and extremist resources.&quot; The international police organization Interpol has stopped executing Belarusian politically motivated search warrants. However, Belarusians are subject to extradition in Russia and most CIS countries. Vietnam extradited Vasil Verameichyk, a former Belarusian military officer who fought against Russia in Ukraine, to Belarus, where he faces over 20 years of imprisonment or the death penalty, Belarusian media reported on Nov. 20. Verameichyk, who supported the 2020 protests and joined the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment to fight on Ukraine&#x2019;s side in the early days of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, was wounded in combat in April 2022. Following discharge from military service, he was elected in 2024 to Belarus&#x2019; exiled Coordination Council, a group opposing the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. Belarusian propaganda broadcasted his arrest in a documentary on Nov. 20, showing Verameichyk disembarking the plane with his hands tied, accompanied by security personnel from an otherwise empty plane. The report accused Belarusian volunteers in Ukraine of planning an invasion of Belarus. Konstantin Bychek, head of the investigative department of the Belarus KGB, said in the film that Belarusian justice will reach those Belarus considers &#x201C;extremists and terrorists&#x201D; in any place on Earth. As the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment was declared a terrorist organization and Lukashenko has broadened the use of capital punishment to apply in case of an attempted terrorist act, Belarusian activists fear Verameichyk risks not only a heavy prison sentence but also death row. Vasil Verameichyk moved to Vietnam after being denied residence in Lithuania and, reportedly, entry back to Ukraine. He was detained on Nov. 13 and hastily deported the next day, according to the opposition-led Coordination Council. Belarus and Vietnam signed an extradition agreement in December 2023. However, the expert in international criminal law, Ales Mikhalevich, suggests that rapid deportation goes against a typical timeline, which requires 40-50 days for the procedure. &#x201C;I am 99% sure that Vasil was &#x2018;on the radar&#x2019; for some time. If he was really detained in a criminal case, such a quick extradition would not have happened,&#x201D; Mikhalevich told the independent outlet Zerkalo. Lithuania, a country that hosts Verameichyk&#x2019;s wife and daughter, recognized him as a threat to national security over his prior service in the Belarusian army and banned him from entering the EU. Lithuania&#x2019;s State Security Department maintained that the decision was justified. &#x201C;It cannot be ruled out that attempts to escalate this story from outside may be another information operation against Lithuania,&#x201D; Lithuania&#x2019;s public broadcaster LRT quotes the department&#x2019;s statement. Lukashenko deprived Verameichyk of his military rank with a decree signed in September 2022. Former Belarusian volunteers told the Kyiv Independent that Verameichyk told them that he could not return to Ukraine over an entry ban. Andrei Kushnerau, who co-founded the Association of Belarusian Volunteers in Ukraine together with Verameichyk and coordinated the efforts to help him, told the Kyiv Independent that Verameichyk attributes the ban to a conflict with some of the regiment&#x2019;s staff members. Several volunteers encountered such a ban in 2022. According to Kushnerau, Verameichyk sought to return to Ukraine in 2025 as soon as the entry ban expired. The Kastus Kalinouski Regiment is undergoing restructuring after two leaders of the formation were accused of corruption. At the press conference in Vilnius, the new leader, Pavel Shurmei, said that the regiment didn&#x2019;t take part in imposing any restrictions on Verameichyk, but did not deny that an entry ban exists. Belarusian activists urge states to engage in negotiations with the Lukashenko regime to exchange the former volunteer. &#x201C;The man is now under the threat of (&#x2026;) of execution, precisely because he fought for Ukraine, so the case of a prisoner of war works quite well,&#x201D; Kushnerau told the Kyiv Independent. The Coordination Council set forward a statement, calling on Ukraine to include Verameichyk on the list of Ukrainian POWs or swap him for Belarusian spies arrested in Lithuania or Ukraine. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the Belarusian opposition, called on the international community to end cooperation with the regime on extraditing Belarusians and to consider cases individually so that a single line on a CV can&#x2019;t become grounds for labeling a person as a national security threat. &#x201C;No one should be handed over to Lukashenka&#x2019;s KGB. Don&apos;t reject Belarusians seeking safety from the regime&apos;s terror,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X. Lukashenko pardoned 32 political prisoners convicted of &#x201C;extremist crimes&#x201D; in the sixth round of releases ahead of the 2025 presidential elections, as some 1,300 dissidents remain behind bars. Eight women and 24 men were released, Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office reported on Nov. 20 without specifying the names. Reportedly, seventeen of them have chronic diseases, and one has a disability. The press office says that all prisoners &#x201C;pleaded guilty, repented&#x201D; and will remain under strict control of the Interior Ministry. This is the sixth instance of the release of political prisoners in Belarus since July. Whereas the total number of released dissidents reached 178, at least 223 individuals were recognized as political prisoners, Viasna Human Rights Center reports. Political prisoners are forced to write pleas for pardon, Viasna notes, which entails admitting the &#x201C;guilt&#x201D; of their crimes. The first wave of pardons coincided with Independence Day, officially celebrated in Belarus on July 3. Eighteen prisoners were released, including the former leader of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party, Ryhor Kostuseu. The next rounds followed in August , two in September, and one in early November. Mid-November, Lukashenko also allowed a family visit to prominent opposition figure Maria Kalesnikava, who&#x2019;s been held incommunicado for over 600 days. In remarks for BBC earlier in October, Lukashenko claimed he would consider her plea for pardon. Ahead of the 2025 presidential elections, Belarusian propaganda parades the releases as the &#x201C;acts of mercy&#x201D; from the regime. Yet the releases occur against the background of sweeping police raids, targeting hundreds of relatives of political prisoners and former detainees, resulting in new arrests and criminal cases. Human rights activists consider the arrests as a pre-election intimidation campaign. Since the contested 2020 presidential elections, which Lukashenko claimed to win, his regime has been waging repressions against any dissent, jailing over 1,300 political prisoners, eliminating independent media and all but four loyalist parties. Lukashenko admitted to shutting down the internet during the 2020 unrest and claimed he may authorize a full shutdown during the 2025 presidential elections if new protests emerge, state-run news outlet Belta reported on Nov. 22. Lukashenko claimed that the 2020 internet blackout was necessary to protect the country. Speaking to the students of Minsk State Linguistic University, one of the major hubs of the students&#x2019; revolt in 2020, &#x201C;If this (the protests) happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&#x201D; Lukashenko promised. On Aug. 9, 2020, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets in protests against rigged presidential elections that extended Lukashenko&#x2019;s then-26-year rule to a sixth term. The police responded with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash grenades, and severe beatings. Lukashenko denied allegations of violence against demonstrators, asserting, &#x201C;No one was holding down or beating anyone,&#x201D; despite widespread reports of police brutality during the 2020 protests. To curb the spread of information about protests and severe police brutality against their participants, the authorities started blocking the internet, Human Rights Watch said. The independent monitoring recorded a 50% connectivity drop in August 2020. The officials have denied shutting down the internet and explained the blackouts by alleged DDoS attacks on the government infrastructure, the claim experts dismiss. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who received popular support and claimed to take over Lukashenko in 2020&apos;s ballot, interprets the threats to repeat blackouts as a sign of the regime&#x2019;s insecurity. &#x201C;Despite four years of repression and imprisoned people, he (Lukashenko) is afraid of the Belarusian people,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya said at the Halifax International Security Forum. The next presidential elections in Belarus are scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, half a year ahead of the term permitted by the law. The electoral campaign is accompanied by countrywide police raids against activists, former political prisoners, and their relatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-threatens-internet-shutdown-in-case-of-protests-during-2025-elections/	2024-11-29T04:34:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184329764.jpg
HUR Chief Budanov rubbishes new dismissal rumours, blames Russian propaganda ops	The head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) has dismissed fresh rumours of his imminent firing, describing them on Nov. 29 as &quot;rumors and disinformation&quot; spread by Russian propaganda. Earlier in the week, New Voice of Ukraine reported that the Ukrainian President&apos;s Office wanted to replace Kyrylo Budanov with a &quot;a person more loyal to the authorities.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, at a certain point, these narratives were spread in the Ukrainian information space, many of them were replicated by Russian propaganda,&quot; Budanov told BBC Ukraine. &quot;But there is nothing surprising in this. Throwing out rumors and disinformation is what they do to destabilize the country, and to destabilize the team,&quot; he added. Budanov insisted he had &quot;normal working relations&quot; with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team. It&apos;s not the first time in recent months that rumors of Budanov&apos;s imminent dismissal have circulated. Zelensky on Oct. 21 denied similar rumors. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to do that. I was not going to replace Budanov. This information was circulating, yes. There was no such question about (Defense Minister Rustem) Umerov either,&quot; Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. Zelensky&apos;s statement followed media speculation that Budanov was in line for dismissal. Budanov, 38, has been the head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence since August 2020. In late September, Umerov dismissed two of Budanov&apos;s deputies, Viktor Zaitsev and Ihor Ostapenko. The decision was not made in cooperation with Budanov, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-chief-budanov-rubbishes-new-dismissal-rumours-blames-russian-propaganda-ops/	2024-11-29T04:08:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156902890.jpg
Media identifies nearly 81,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists and volunteers have identified the names of 80,973 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as of Nov. 29, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet. Since Mediazona&apos;s update in mid-November, the names of 3,830 more Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Over half of those killed were not affiliated with the army at the beginning of the war in 2022, meaning they voluntarily signed contracts to fight in Ukraine. Many died in the first two to four weeks after being sent to the front line, the investigation said. The share of volunteers now accounts for 22% of the total number of confirmed losses in the Russian army. Last year, in November 2023, volunteers accounted for only 14%. The share of deaths among those sent to the front from prison is on the decline. As of November 2023, they accounted for 26% of all losses, and now 18%. The large-scale involvement of convicts at the front allowed the Russian authorities to support the army&apos;s offensive potential without causing additional damage to the economy. &quot;The convicts were still actively involved in society and were not skilled workers. This distinguishes them, for example, from those mobilized, whose care has weakened several sectors of the economy,&quot; the investigation said. According to the investigation, most of the soldiers killed were from Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Sverdlovsk Oblast. As of the morning of Nov. 29, the Russian army had lost about 738,660 soldiers, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Over the past day, Russian losses amounted to 2,030 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identify-nearly-81-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-11-29T03:26:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1870879351.jpg
Ukraine hits oil depot in Rostov Oblast, destroys Buk radar station in Russian-occupied territory, Kyiv claims	Ukrainian forces reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, and destroyed a Buk-M3 radar station in Russian-occupied territories in Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said on Nov. 29. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, and oil refineries. The Ukrainian military said that on the night of Nov. 29, they struck the Atlas oil depot in Rostov Oblast. As a result of the strike, fires broke out on the territory of the facility, the statement said. According to the General Staff, Atlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex, and supplies petroleum products to the Russian army. The oil depot was previously targeted in the summer of 2024. Elsewhere, a radar station of the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system was destroyed in the Russian-held part of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff reported. The combat mission was carried out by units of the Unmanned Systems Forces, the Special Operations Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) in cooperation with other units of the Defense Forces. On Nov. 16, a drone unit in the National Guard&apos;s 27th Pechersk Brigade destroyed another Russian anti-aircraft missile Buk-M1 system worth $10 million. On the morning of Nov. 29, the General Staff reported that Russia had lost 1,006 air defense systems since the start of its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-oil-depot-in-rostov-oblast-destroys-buk-radar-station-in-russian-occupied-territory/	2024-11-29T02:39:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240557988.jpg
Russia's reported daily losses in Ukraine pass 2,000 for the first time	Russia&apos;s daily losses in Ukraine surpassed 2,000 for the first time, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 29. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Moscow&apos;s troops lost 2,030 men over the preceding day. This surpasses the previous record of 1,950 set on Nov. 12. The total figure stands at 738,660. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Ukraine has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties. &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowleded only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. But estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26 said between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on. The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. It based its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The surge in Russian losses comes as Moscow&apos;s forces step up pressure across the front lines. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost to Ukraine in Kursk Oblast before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. A British defense intelligence assessment, seen by The Telegraph, warns that Russia is likely to intensify kamikaze drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, using new launch sites near the border. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 9 that &quot;tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the best Russian shock units&quot; are aiming to push Ukrainian forces out of the Russian enclave, raising concerns of a significant escalation in the war. The Kremlin is also facing economic pressures &#x2014; the purchasing power of the Russian ruble this week hit the lowest point since March 2022, as the economic toll of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine becomes glaring. Russia&apos;s expanding spending on the war has fueled inflation, prompting Russia&apos;s Central Bank to hike its interest rate to the highest level since the early 2000s &#x2014; 21 percent &#x2014; to rein in consumer prices. &quot;Russia is currently facing an impossible economic conundrum because of the rapid increase in military expenditures and the Western sanctions,&quot; Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist specializing in post-Soviet countries, told the Kyiv Independent. However, economists and analysts are divided on how much of an impact Russia&apos;s economic problems will have on its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-reported-daily-losses-in-ukraine-pass-2-000-for-the-first-time/	2024-11-29T01:49:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184752486.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 22 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least one civilian, and injured at least 22 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 29. Russian forces launched 132 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Orel, Millerovo, Kursk, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to a report from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 88 drones in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa oblasts. Forty-one drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Another drone returned to Russia. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 15 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and another nine were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Odesa Oblast, Russia attacked the region with several drones, injuring seven people. Four victims were hospitalized, with one woman in a severe condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. In three settlements of the Odesa district, 13 residential and country houses, garages, railway infrastructure, outbuildings, a gas pipe, and a car were damaged. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured two people in the town of Kurakhove and one person in the town of Toretsk, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast&apos;s Nikopol district, a 33-year-old man suffered injuries. He was hospitalized with moderately severe injuries, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Drone attacks and artillery shelling damaged 11 houses, six outbuildings, a garage, and a utility company. Strikes damaged power lines and a gas pipeline as well, he added. In Sumy Oblast, one person suffered injuries because of an air strike in the Esman community, the local military administration reported. In Kyiv, the debris of the downed drones fell in three districts of the city, causing a polyclinic in the Dniprovskyi district to catch fire. A security guard at the medical facility was injured and hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-1-injure-22-over-past-day/	2024-11-29T01:38:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-29-09_57_40.jpeg
Police disperse protesters in Tbilisi after pro-Russian government refuses to negotiate EU accession	Police have started dispersing protesters who gathered near the parliament for a spontaneous rally in Tbilisi overnight on Nov. 29, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The protest followed Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s statement that Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union could be postponed until 2028, prompting outrage among some in society, who are demanding changes in the country&apos;s political course. The ruling Georgian Dream party led by Kobakhidze has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Following the election, the European Commission suspended Georgia&apos;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West. The protest was organized through social media, the media outlet Echo of the Caucasus reported. Protesters claimed the refusal to negotiate accession to the EU by 2028 is &quot;a betrayal of the country&apos;s interests, and a violation of Article 78 of the Georgian Constitution, which enshrines the country&apos;s aspirations for European integration.&quot; Prior to the dispersal, clashes between law enforcement officers and protesters occurred, and lasted for several hours. The police used pepper spray, and demonstrators threw eggs and other objects at the police. Police also used water cannons to break up the demonstration on Chichinadze Street. Several people were beaten by police, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Georgian Interior Ministry said the action went &quot;beyond the limits of the law.&quot; The ministry noted that three police officers were injured, and two of them were hospitalized. When the Georgian parliament&apos;s decision on the EU became known, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili held emergency consultations with the diplomatic corps and the opposition, and issued a statement afterward, the Georgian media outlet SOVA reported. Zourabichvili previously accused the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party of rigging the recent elections and refused to accept the stated results. Along with other opposition party leaders, she has called for public demonstrations and a parliamentary boycott. According to Zourabichvili, &quot;the non-existent, illegitimate government has declared not peace, but war &#x2014; against its own people, its own past and its own future.&quot; &quot;There is no Georgian statehood, no independence, no future without Russia on this path.&quot; The president said that a few minutes after Kobakhidze&apos;s speech, in which he announced the suspension of European integration, Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;expressed his satisfaction and praised the Georgian authorities for their obedience.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/police-disperse-protesters-in-tbilisi-after-pro-russian-government-refuses-to-negotiate-eu-accession/	2024-11-29T01:08:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186710484.jpg
Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrives in North Korea for official visit	Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for an official visit on Nov. 29, amid deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. After arriving in Pyongyang, Belousov was greeted by his North Korean counterpart No Kwang-chol, and members of North Korea&apos;s military, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Belousov will participate in meetings with &quot;the military and political leadership of the DPRK,&quot; it added. Belousov&apos;s visit to Pyongyang comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s state visit to the hermit country in June, where Russia formally deepened it military and economic cooperation with Pyongyang. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-defense-minister-arrives-in-north-korea-for-state-visit/	2024-11-28T22:35:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2163496348.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 738,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 738,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 29. This number includes 2,030 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,458 tanks, 19,339 armored fighting vehicles, 30,272 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,886 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,006 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,750 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-738-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-28T22:13:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Ukrainian nuclear plants reduce output in response to large-scale Russian attack	Nuclear power plants in Ukraine reduced electricity production on Nov. 28 as a precautionary measure in response to a Russian mass aerial attack on Ukraine, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said. For the second time in less than two weeks, the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukraine nuclear power plants (NPPs) lowered their power levels following an early morning Russian attack on energy infrastructure across the country. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure across the country, including the far-western regions. Russian forces launched more than 180 drones and missiles at Ukraine. Following the attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s power grid, forcing emergency blackouts to be implemented in multiple regions across the country. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk,&quot; Grossi said, while adding that none of the reactor sustained damage during the attacks. All nine reactors operating in Ukraine reduced output, with one reactor at the Rivne NPP was disconnected from the grid. All the NPPs continued to receive external electricity despite the Khmelnytskyi NPP losing connection to two of its lines. &quot;The IAEA will continue to assess the extent of damage to facilities and power lines that are essential for nuclear safety and security,&quot; Grossi added. Previously, NPPs in Ukraine reduced electricity output on Nov. 17 following overnight mass attacks on the same day. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. During the visit of two IAEA teams deployed to NPPs in Ukraine on Nov. 28, they were forced to seek shelter due to ongoing air raid sirens.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-nuclear-plants-reduce-production-in-response-to-russian-attack/	2024-11-28T21:27:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1243382762.jpg
Oil depot burning in Russia's Rostov Oblast amid drone attack, local media reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire has engulfed an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Nov. 29, local media reported. Eyewitnesses reported seeing large clouds of smoke over the FDKU Atlas oil depot in the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky District of Rostov Oblast. Videos of the fire posted on various Telegram channels appear to show a large blaze engulfing the night sky. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the location of reported fire. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the reported attack. Ahead of the start of the blaze, acting Rostov Oblast Governor Yuri Slyusar claimed Russian air defenses intercepted 30 Ukrainian drones in the northwest of the region. The governor added that emergency services are &quot;extinguishing a large fire at an industrial site,&quot; without specifying the location. Slyusar also claimed two houses were damaged in the Masalovka and Dyachkino communities amid the drone attack. Ukraine routinely strikes Russian oil bases and weapons depots in an attempt to diminish Russia&apos;s fighting power in its war against Ukraine. Ukrainian strikes have targeted weapons storage facilities, military bases, and oil depots in Rostov Oblast in an attempt to slow Russian advances in Eastern Ukraine and pressure Russians to call for an end to the war. Ukrainian drones previously struck the FDKU Atlas oil facility in August, a military intelligence (HUR) source confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. In recent months Ukraine has tried to move Russia&apos;s war away from its own territory, striking targets deeper inside Russia. On Oct. 31, a Ukrainian drone struck an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border. Fossil fuels are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Despite Western sanctions, Russia still provides oil and gas to other countries around the world, primarily India and China.	https://kyivindependent.com/local-media-reports-oil-depot-burning-in-rostov-oblast-following-ukrainian-strike/	2024-11-28T19:57:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/1-3.jpeg
Boris Johnson calls for British, European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of potential peace deal	In an interview with The Telegraph&apos;s Ukraine: The Latest podcast on Nov. 28, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that any possible ceasefire should involve a European peacekeeping mission including British forces to defend the front line. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think we should be sending in combat troops to take on the Russians,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But I think as part of the solution, as part of the end state, you&#x2019;re going to want to have multinational European peace-keeping forces monitoring the border, helping the Ukrainians.&quot; Following Donald Trump&apos;s 2024 election victory, world leaders are preparing for an abrupt shift in the United States&apos; policy on Ukraine. Much is unknown about Trump&apos;s plans for Ukraine. Trump has promised to end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; and has called for peace talks, prompting many world leaders to discuss potential outcomes. The Telegraph reported on Nov. 7, citing three Trump staffers, that Trump may call on British and European troops to enforce a buffer zone that he would try to impose over the current front line in Ukraine as part of a possible peace plan. Johnson, a supporter of Trump, said during his interview that he &quot;cannot see that such a European operation could possibly happen without the British,&quot; said. &quot;We need to be spelling out what kind of security guarantees we think are appropriate,&quot; Johnson added. Johnson&apos;s comments on the potential presence of combat troops in Ukraine came after the French outlet Le Monde reported that the U.K. and France have been discussing deploying soldiers or private defense contractors in Ukraine following President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy later said on Nov. 26 that London is not planning to deploy its military personnel on the ground in Ukraine. During the interview, the former prime minister said the United Kingdom is &quot;morally responsible&quot; for Ukraine as a signatory of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. The agreement obliged Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons and demilitarize, a move that has failed to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression. &quot;The only thing that really works is a Nato Article 5 guarantee that has kept the peace in Europe for 80 years,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It&#x2019;s the reason the Baltic states are in NATO. It&#x2019;s the reason that the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Finns and the Swedes are now in NATO.&quot; A staunch supporter of Ukraine, Johnson previously said that extending NATO membership to Ukraine is the only solution, and it has to be done, as the only long-term solution that provides peace and stability. Despite Ukraine&apos;s ongoing challenges in securing an invitation from a NATO country to join the military alliance, Johnson said that Western allies would need to make clear what potential security guarantees would be offered to Kyiv as part of any peace agreement. As the war drags on past 1,000 days, Johnson&apos;s comment on peace negotiations reflect those made by Ukrainian officials over the past year. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said in May that Ukraine &quot;clearly understands&quot; that Russia&apos;s full-scale war will end with negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky has more recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/boris-johnson-calls-for-british-peacekeepers-in-ukraine/	2024-11-28T18:51:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1242687211.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of executing 4 more Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk	Four unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were apparently shot and killed by Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, adding to the five previously reported executions of Ukrainian soldiers, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 28. According to the statement, Russian troops captured four Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector on Nov. 22. After forcing the soldiers to surrender, Russian forces are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. In total nine Ukrainian POWs were executed by Russia in the village of Petrivka. It was not immediately clear if the two reported executions are directly connected, or whether they occurred at the same time. &quot;The deliberate killing of prisoners of war constitutes a blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a grave international crime,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said in a statement. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Last week, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported two other Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk sector. Ahead of the most recent reported cases, law enforcement officers previously said they were investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-suspected-of-executing-4-more-ukrainian-pows-near-pokrovsk/	2024-11-28T17:39:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Russian lawyer sentenced to 7 years in prison for publicly speaking out against Ukraine war, media reports	A Russian court has sentenced prominent lawyer Dmitry Talantov to seven years in prison for criticizing the war in Ukraine on social media, according to the Russian independent monitoring group OVD-Info. Talantov, 63, was arrested in June 2022 and has been behind bars for over two years. He was convicted of inciting hatred and spreading what Russian law enforcement called &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military, offenses introduced under a 2022 law that criminalizes public dissent against the war. Talantov, who once chaired the regional lawyers&apos; association in Udmurtia, was accused of posting several social media comments condemning Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In a letter from detention, Talantov explained his actions: &quot;I once looked at a photo of a maimed Ukrainian woman and decided that I can&#x2019;t stay silent anymore. But I remained a lawyer. I published my opinion in a way that doesn&#x2019;t violate the formalistic law. And you know what? It is not my problem that a normal act is perceived by someone as a crime.&quot; The court in Zavyalovo, Udmurtia, found him guilty and handed down the seven-year sentence on Nov. 28. OVD-Info reports that over 1,100 people have been implicated in criminal cases related to anti-war expressions since the invasion began, with 340 currently incarcerated or involuntarily committed to medical institutions. Before his arrest, Talantov had been a longtime chair of Udmurtia&#x2019;s Chamber of Lawyers and was involved in defending former journalist Ivan Safronov, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2022 for exposing military incidents and arms deals.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-lawyer-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-publicly-speaking-out-against-ukraine-war/	2024-11-28T15:41:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182851233.jpg
Russia's drone attack damages children's medical center in Kyiv, injuries reported	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched attack drones targeting Kyiv, among other regions, on the evening of Nov. 28. Air defense systems shot down the drones, but debris caused structural damage in several areas of the city, according to officials. Several explosions were heard in different parts of the capital overnight on Nov. 29. In the Dniprovskyi district, drone debris caused a fire on the facade of a children&apos;s medical center. The blaze, which damaged the building&apos;s exterior, shattered windows and uprooted nearby trees, was later extinguished. A security guard was injured by the falling wreckage, according to the mayor. In the Sviatoshynskyi district, drone debris struck an infrastructure facility, Klitschko reported. Officials did not provide other details at the time of the publication. Klitschko urged residents to remain in shelters, while air defense operations were still active as of 1 a.m. local time.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-drone-attack-damages-childrens-medical-center-in-kyiv-injuries-reported/	2024-11-28T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28-16_08_50.jpeg
Foreign Ministry says Kyiv discusses mobilization strategy with partners, calls on faster military aid	Ukraine has urged its international partners to expedite the delivery of critical military equipment, emphasizing that quicker aid is more crucial than drafting additional personnel. With manpower shortages posing a challenge, Ukraine continues to balance domestic and international expectations while focusing on strengthening its forces on the battlefield. &quot;We are now in the situation when we need more equipment to arm all the people that have already been mobilized, and we think the first priority is to send quicker, faster military aid,&quot; Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s foreign ministry, said on Nov. 28 during a press briefing in Kyiv. Tykhyi noted that Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization strategy is regularly discussed with international allies alongside other key topics, including defense strategy and sanctions on Russia. He dismissed suggestions of tension over the issue. &quot;I can confirm that this topic is being discussed at negotiations. I can refute that this is a point of tension or that it&apos;s being discussed in a critical or negative manner,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the issue during a Nov. 19 parliamentary session, presenting a 10-point plan to bolster internal resilience. Zelensky ruled out lowering the mobilization age despite facing pressure from citizens and U.S. lawmakers to do so. Instead, he proposed reforms, including new management strategies, the creation of a military ombudsman, and a contract system for citizens below the mobilization age.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-says-kyiv-discusses-mobilization-strategy-with-partners-calls-on-faster-military-aid/	2024-11-28T13:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2105335403.jpg
Can Russia sustain its war effort as ruble plummets, inflation soars?	With the purchasing power of the Russian ruble hitting the lowest point since March 2022, the economic toll of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine becomes glaring. Russia&apos;s expanding spending on the war has fueled inflation, prompting Russia&apos;s Central Bank to hike interest rates to the highest level since the early 2000s &#x2014; 21 percent &#x2014; to rein in consumer prices. Inflation remained high regardless of the rate hike, speeding up to over 1 percent in the first three weeks of November and pushing the year-to-year numbers to over 8 percent. In the wake of the economic challenges the country has faced over the past year, the U.S. government&apos;s Nov. 21 decision to impose new sanctions on dozens of Russian banks has proven hard for the country&apos;s economy to swallow. &quot;Russia is currently facing an impossible economic conundrum because of the rapid increase in military expenditures and the Western sanctions,&quot; Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist specializing in post-Soviet countries, told the Kyiv Independent. However, economists and analysts are divided on how much of an impact Russia&apos;s economic problems will have on its war effort. Some argue that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Russia to finance its war. &quot;Undaunted by economic reality, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is raising defense and security costs to officially $176 billion in 2025, 41 percent of the federal budget expenditures,&quot; &#xA0;Aslund said. &quot;Yet, Russia can only finance 2 percent of GDP in budget deficit a year ($40 billion) because its only reserve is the National Wealth Fund,&quot; he said. &quot;At the end of March 2024, its liquid resources amounted to a mere $55 billion. Nobody lends money to Russia.&quot; But others say that, despite all the economic difficulties, the Kremlin will have enough resources to finance the war for a long time at the expense of cutting spending on the country&apos;s civilian sector. Sergei Aleksashenko, a Russian-born economist based in the U.S., said that &quot;Putin&apos;s economic problems shouldn&apos;t be overestimated.&quot; &quot;He will spend as much money on the war as necessary,&quot; he said. Even so, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has shown openness to a potential plan to dramatically increase oil output and drive down oil prices, on which Russia&apos;s economy is heavily dependent. As a result, the Kremlin may be in for a bumpy ride. &quot;2025 will be a moment of truth,&quot; Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition politician who was an economic advisor for the Russian government in the early 2000s, told the Kyiv Independent. Central Bank between rock and hard placeDue to constant increases in military spending, Russia&apos;s budget deficit amounted to 3.2 trillion rubles ($30 billion) in 2023 and is expected to amount to 3.1 trillion rubles ($29 billion) in 2024. Since 2023, inflation has been speeding up due to the same reason &#x2014; from 2.3 percent year-on-year in April 2023 to 8.2 percent in November 2024. Inflation contributed to the decreasing purchasing power of the ruble, which fell to 108 per dollar on Nov. 28, the lowest level since March 2022. One of the latest blows to the ruble&apos;s value was the U.S. government&apos;s Nov. 21 decision to sanction dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, which handles oil and gas payments. To rein in accelerating inflation, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising the interest rate &#x2014; from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to 21 percent in October 2024. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Nabiullina, the central bank&apos;s chief, has prompted a backlash from businesses, including those involved in the military industrial complex. Sergei Chemezov, CEO of state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, has lashed out at the Central Bank repeatedly. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; he said in October. &quot;The question today is this: either we cease all high-tech exports &#x2014; airplanes, air defense systems, ships, and so on, which require production timelines of a year or more &#x2014; or we need to take some measures.&quot; Elvira Nabiullina, head of the country&apos;s Central Bank, in Saint Petersburg, Russia on July 5, 2024. (Maksim Konstantinov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)A man walks past the Russian Central Bank headquarters in downtown Moscow, Russia on Sep. 6, 2023. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)Opposition politician Milov said that Chemezov and Nabiullina &quot;are both right&quot; in their own way. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. &quot;Nabiullina is in a tough spot because of the spending on the war,&quot; Torbj&#xF6;rn Becker, director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics and a co-author of a recent report on the Russian wartime economy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The whole war effort is creating a headache for Nabiullina. The military-industrial complex wants to spend more money. The military guys don&apos;t care about macroeconomic stability.&quot; Is Russia headed for stagflation?The Central Bank&apos;s policy of making credit more expensive may be contributing to a slowdown in economic growth. Russia&apos;s gross domestic product rose 3.6 percent in 2023 amid a boom fueled by military spending, according to the State Statistics Service (RosStat). Russia&apos;s economy is expected to grow by 3.5-4 percent in 2024, but the growth is expected to slow down to 0.5-1.5 percent in 2025, according to Russia&apos;s Central Bank. &quot;There are no new investments, and the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus is decreasing,&quot; Milov said. &quot;(Economic growth) is also being killed by high inflation and the Central Bank&apos;s high rate. Credit is unbelievably expensive.&quot; Milov believes that Russia&apos;s GDP may fall in 2025, and the country may experience stagflation &#x2014; a combination of stagnation and high inflation. Alexandra Prokopenko, an economic expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, argued that &quot;it&apos;s not stagflation yet, but Russia is close.&quot; &quot;Recent data suggests that the overheated Russian economy is starting to cool,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This includes a fall in retail lending, slowing wage increases, and dropping industrial growth. However, it shouldn&apos;t be overstated. Despite the signs of cooling, the fundamental drivers of overheating remain in place &#x2014; growing military production and an intense labor shortage.&quot; She added that &quot;in some sectors related to the military (like, for example, finished metal products and optics and computers), there is no sign of any cooling.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Uralvagonzavod, a Russian tank factory, in Nizhny Tagil, Russia on Feb. 15, 2024. (Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Yulia Pavytska, an economic expert at the Kyiv School of Economics&apos; think-tank, KSE Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the current policy of the Russian Central Bank will either lead to stagnation &#x2014; the absence of economic growth &#x2014; or the regulator will fail, in which case inflation will continue to rise.&quot; She added, however, that &quot;a combination of stagnation and inflation is currently an unlikely scenario, given the continued fiscal stimulus in the form of war-related expenditures and the significant labor market deficit.&quot; Aleksashenko said that he did not expect a drop in Russia&apos;s GDP in 2025. He told the Kyiv Independent that labor market shortages were slowing down economic growth but their impact was relatively small. Higher inflation on the horizon?Some analysts predict that pressure from industry, including the military-industrial complex, will lead to Nabiullina&apos;s downfall. &quot;Putin understands that Nabiullina is useful but there is more and more pressure from security forces,&quot; Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In this struggle, the military-industrial complex will inevitably win because Putin is waging a war.&quot; Aslund agreed, saying that &quot;Chemezov and other industrialists will oust her very soon and make the correct point that high interest rates solve none of the (Central Bank&apos;s) tasks, which would be correct, but they will push for lower interest rates, which will aggravate the situation.&quot; &quot;Inflation will rise, the capital outflow will accelerate, and the exchange rate will fall,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Aslund also said that he &quot;would not suggest hyperinflation (over 50 percent increase a month) but a substantial increase in inflation, which will cause popular dissatisfaction.&quot; Andrei Movchan, a Russian-born economist and founder of Movchan&apos;s Group, told the Kyiv Independent that, if the Central Bank changes its policy and cuts its rate by several percentage points, inflation could rise to 20-25 percent but it would not lead to a &quot;catastrophe&quot; or &quot;destruction of the economy.&quot; Although economists agree that Russia is experiencing economic difficulties, they are split on whether they will make its war effort unsustainable. Aslund said that &quot;Russia&apos;s macroeconomic failures will become a critical factor next year, perhaps rather soon, though these things are always difficult to time.&quot; Anders Olofsg&#xE5;rd, a deputy director at the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, shares these thoughts. He told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;it is becoming increasingly expensive for Russia to finance the war, with domestic military production at capacity, inflation and wages surging, and them increasingly turning to allies such as Iran and North Korea for military equipment and even soldiers.&quot; &quot;They are also gradually depleting the external reserves they have, and the worse the economic situation, the more they need to turn to those reserves to afford the expansion in military expenditures,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t mean that they will run out of money tomorrow, but depending on oil and gas prices, the effectiveness and enforcement of sanctions, and the competence and credibility of their macroeconomic policies, that day is coming.&quot; Milov said that there is less and less money at Russia&apos;s Federal Wealth Fund, and it&apos;s difficult for the government to borrow at such a high interest rate. The government has tried to raise money by increasing taxes but the &quot;tax hikes will accelerate the slowing down of the economy and reduce the tax base,&quot; Milov continued. &quot;They&apos;ll have to decide something because they can&apos;t wage such a high-intensity war anymore,&quot; he added. Milov said that the production of more primitive military products &#x2014; such as drones, bombs, and artillery shells &#x2014; is expanding. However, it is more difficult for Russia to produce more complex equipment &#x2014; tanks, armored vehicles and aircraft, he added. Other economists are more cautious. &quot;Russia is currently not facing serious fiscal challenges,&quot; Pavytska said. &quot;It is likely that the Finance Ministry will be able to execute this year&apos;s budget as planned.&quot; She said that domestic borrowing would be &quot;costly,&quot; but the government would take this step if needed because &quot;the regime needs money for the war now, not in some abstract future.&quot; &quot;In modern Russian realities, the key interest rate is, de facto, irrelevant to the regime,&quot; Pavytska added. &quot;Funds for the war will be found in any case, including by cutting other expenditures, as evidenced by the draft budget for next year, or through monetary issuance.&quot; Movchan and Aleksashenko said that the defense sector gets direct funding from the budget, not loans, and it would be funded regardless of high interest rates. They argued that Russia&apos;s economic difficulties were not affecting its war effort. Movchan said that Russia would start experiencing problems with funding the war only if oil prices fell significantly, leading to a major drop in the government&apos;s foreign currency earnings. He added, however, that he believed that a major fall in oil prices was unlikely in the near future. The hope for a drop in oil prices was boosted recently by Trump&apos;s plan to issue more permits to drastically increase U.S. oil and liquefied natural gas production. Reuters reported on Nov. 25 that Trump&apos;s transition team was working on the plan and would roll it out within days of him taking office in January. Oreshkin said that Russia&apos;s current economic turmoil is unlikely to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s hand in potential peace talks. But, if Trump manages to drive down oil prices and cracks down on Russia&apos;s evasion of oil sanctions, Ukraine will have a stronger position, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-russias-economic-problems-make-its-war-unsustainable/	2024-11-28T12:53:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1259146472.jpg
‘It’s excruciating’ – Ukrainians describe surviving Russian attacks that cost them health, loved ones, and homes	WARNING: This article contains descriptions of graphic scenes. Anna Kotova was chatting with her sister on a video call, admiring her image on the screen. It was her 19th birthday, and for the first time in a while, she was feeling good about how she looked. &#x201C;I used to dye my hair a lot, and then I realized my natural hair had grown out, and I liked it so much. I had long eyelashes, and I looked so good,&#x201D; Kotova recalls. &#xA0; Then, in an instant, everything went dark. &#x201C;The missile hit right after I thought that.&#x201D; It was Jan. 14, 2023, the day when Russia unleashed one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine, striking an apartment building in Dnipro and killing 46 people. &quot;I didn&apos;t see or hear anything, like the missile flying&#x2026; There was none of that,&#x201D; Kotova says. &#x201C;At some point, I felt that I was thrown back, and that was it. My brain just stopped working. I don&apos;t remember anything at all, just darkness.&quot; Kotova was among the 79 people injured in the strike. She lost one eye and endured numerous operations to remove all the shards of glass from her body. She is currently receiving laser treatment to minimize the scars left on her face and body.

(Mykola Miakshykov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Psychologists say that, like Kotova, the thousands of Ukrainians who have survived brutal Russian attacks since Feb. 24, 2022 have been left not just with lasting scars on their bodies, but long-term damage to their mental health from the trauma of their experiences. And their number is steadily growing, as Russian attacks have been wounding civilians almost every day since the start of the full-scale war. For Kotova, the day the Russian Kh-22 missile destroyed her home split her life into &#x201C;before and after,&#x201D; with no possibility of a return to the way things were before. Anna Kotova in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)&#x201C;You live one day at a time because you are still scared of what tomorrow might bring,&#x201D; Kotova told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;You also didn&#x2019;t expect that it would happen then, that a missile would hit your house, that it would happen to you, and that you would suffer such injuries.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#x201C;When I lived in Dnipro, I stopped reacting to the air raid alarms over time. If it hits, it hits. But back then, I just couldn&apos;t imagine the consequences.&#x201D; Kotova and her boyfriend had moved to Dnipro from now-occupied Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk Oblast on the very day the full-scale invasion began. They rented a spacious apartment with their friends. However, when their friends relocated to another city, the couple began searching for a smaller place. They never found one. &#x201C;On the morning of Jan. 14, everything started very well,&#x201D; Kotova recalls. &#x201C;I woke up to flowers and a new phone, and everything was wonderful. I couldn&apos;t have imagined something so horrible could happen after just a few hours.&#x201D; The explosion occurred around 3 p.m., as Kotova and her boyfriend were preparing to host some guests. Shortly after the blast, Kotova&#x2019;s boyfriend found her on the kitchen floor. He told her he could not see her eyes and her whole face, only blood and glass shards. &#x201C;I remember that when I touched my face with a towel, it felt like minced meat. There was nothing left. It was so slippery and unrecognizable,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I started to panic and asked, &apos;Is this my face?&apos; My boyfriend told me not to touch anything and that everything would be fine. I fell silent and didn&apos;t say anything else.&#x201D; Anna Kotova after Russian attack on Dnipro in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)As they escaped the building, they were able to see the scale of the attack and realized how lucky they had been to survive: &#x201C;I heard people&apos;s screams, sirens, and loud noises. I remember that it was very frightening,&#x201D; Kotova says. But for her, the most challenging part was yet to begin. She was taken to a local hospital, where doctors placed her in a coma and performed surgery. &#x201C;I woke up on the 15th or 16th (of January). I tried to move, but a doctor came up to me and told me that they had removed my eye&#x2026;&#x201D; she says tearfully. &#x201C;I had a breakdown. I couldn&apos;t breathe on my own, couldn&apos;t swallow or talk, and tears started to flow&#x2026; I couldn&#x2019;t see anything; I was just lying there, realizing &#x2026; I no longer had one eye.&#x201D; Numerous other operations, lengthy treatments, and the fitting of eye prosthetics in Austria followed. Kotova currently resides in Czechia but often travels to Kyiv for laser treatment. With time, she has learned to look at herself in the mirror without crying, but she cannot forget that horrible January strike. Her 20th birthday this year, naturally coinciding with the attack&#x2019;s anniversary, was one of her hardest days. Anna Kotova (L) and her boyfriend (R) in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)&#x201C;I knew I was in Czechia, and it was safe there. But I still had this fear that it would happen again.&#x201D; &#x201C;(Shortly after the attack) I simply didn&#x2019;t want to continue treatment. I didn&#x2019;t understand how much more there was to endure or why it happened to me. I thought that maybe it would have been better if I had stayed (meaning died) in that house and not suffered further,&#x201D; Kotova says. &#x201C;(But) I (have come to) truly value life because when you are on the brink of losing it, you hold on to everything you can to ensure it doesn&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201D; In mid-October 2022, Ukrainian soldier Viktor Hanych left the front lines to spend a short vacation with his parents in Kyiv. It was the first time in a while that Hanych, who voluntarily joined the military shortly after the invasion started, had seen his parents. The whole family first gathered at Hanych&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s home before returning to his parents&#x2019; cozy apartment on Zhylianska Street in Kyiv. They talked about &#x201C;everything in the world&#x201D; and soon fell asleep, tired but happy to be together again, Hanych recalls. &#x201C;I woke up to a couple of explosions and quickly told (my parents) to get ready to go to the shelter,&#x201D; he says, adding that they did not hear the air raid siren that night, and his parents usually reacted to them. &#x201C;They had an (underground) parking area right near the house where they hid from attacks,&#x201D; he says. Hanych was the first one to leave the apartment. He told his parents he would hold the door for them and wait outside. He also recalls being very calm, as he was used to explosions while fighting in embattled Kherson and Donetsk oblasts. Just as he reached the first floor, the building was hit by a Russian drone. &#x201C;It landed right in their apartment,&#x201D; Hanych says. &#x201C;As a soldier, I realized what had happened. But the hardest part was the waiting.&#x201D; Although the attack occurred in the early morning, Hanych only identified the bodies of his parents at around 2 p.m. that day. Viktor Hanych in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)It was the day Russia launched its first-ever attack on Kyiv using Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones. Apart from Hanych&#x2019;s parents, the bodies of two more civilians, including a six-month pregnant woman, were found under the rubble of the apartment building. &#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for my comrades&apos; support&#x2026;&#x201D; Hanych says, adding that he had felt a &#x201C;thirst for revenge&#x201D; but was thankfully stopped by his fellow soldiers. After participating in fierce battles near now-occupied Bakhmut, Hanych returned to civilian life to care for his grandmother. To this day, he tries to avoid going to Zhylianska Street, where his parents&#x2019; home once stood. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s excruciating,&#x201D; Hanych says. &#x201C;I think those who experience something similar become fatalists but also begin to cherish and love this life even more. I felt exactly that.&#x201D; The four-room apartment in Sumy was the setting for decades of sorrow and joy in the lives of resident Diana Nazarevska and her family. But now it is gone, destroyed in a Russian attack. &#x201C;It was my grandmother&apos;s apartment. My mother grew up there, and later, when I was about three years old, we moved there with my parents,&#x201D; Nazarevska, 28, says. &#x201C;It was also where I started building my own family with my husband.&#x201D; &#x201C;That apartment held the memories of my family, of my father, when he was still alive.&#x201D; On March 13, Nazarevska, her husband, and their baby daughter slept peacefully when an explosion woke them up. &#x41F;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x442;&#x440;&#x435;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x44D;&#x442;&#x443; &#x43F;&#x443;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x438;&#x44E; &#x432; Instagram &#x41F;&#x443;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x438;&#x44F; &#x43E;&#x442; Diana Nazarevska (@diasya.nazarevskaya) &#x201C;It was the first Shahed drone targeting the residential building, but it was shot down and flew past it. I picked up my daughter, and we lay close to the wall,&#x201D; Nazarevska recalls. Then, she heard another drone approaching. &#x201C;I grabbed my child, stood up, and didn&#x2019;t even have time to run anywhere&#x2026; I just realized that there was an explosion in our house.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then I started shouting for my husband, asking if he was alive. He slept very soundly and didn&apos;t understand what had happened at first.&#x201D; Amid the terrifying chaos, the family grabbed some documents, dressed their baby, and fled the apartment. As her husband opened the door to the hallway, Nazarevska was confronted with the &#x201C;stench of burning and the smell of damp concrete,&#x201D; which she says would likely &#x201C;remain in her memory forever.&#x201D; Rescuers stand near a dead body that was pulled from under the rubble in Sumy, Ukraine on March 14, 2024.

He kept screaming, but no one answered him. He shouted again, and still, no one responded.&#x201D; That night, Russia killed three people and injured 14. It also forever altered Nazarevska&#x2019;s life, teaching her how fragile existence can be and how important it is to cherish every moment, even amid war. &#xA0; &#x201C;But we no longer have a home,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s not just about the walls but the loss of a sense of basic security. For people, home generally means safety. It&#x2019;s the place you go where you know everything will be okay.&#x201D; &#x201C;Unfortunately, that sense of security is lost now.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-describe-surviving-russian-attacks/	2024-11-28T12:33:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1458716680.jpg
Putin wants to escalate' before Trump takes office — Zelensky hits back at Oreshnik threats	Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to escalate the war in Ukraine so that U.S. President Donald Trump fails to end the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 28. Zelensky&apos;s comments come in response to Putin&apos;s fresh threats to target &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv and Ukrainian military facilities with Oreshnik, Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). &quot;(Putin) is aiming to disrupt the efforts of President Trump that are sure to come after his inauguration,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;Putin wants to escalate the situation now so that President Trump fails to end the war.&quot; Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) summit in Astana earlier in the day, Putin said that Russia&apos;s military leadership is now &quot;choosing targets&quot; in Ukraine to hit them with Oreshnik. Zelensky called Putin&apos;s actions &quot;pressure&quot; to force Trump to accept Russia&apos;s terms. On the campaign trail, Trump has criticized military support provided to Ukraine by Joe Biden&apos;s administration and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. While the details of his plans remain elusive, some reports indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Russia first launched Oreshnik in an attack against the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon,&quot; which later was refuted by Zelensky. Russia&apos;s Oreshnik attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted more such strikes against targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts had followed later.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-hits-back-at-putins-oreshnik-threats/	2024-11-28T12:10:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's large-scale attack strikes a 'massive blow' at Ukraine's energy system	Key developments on Nov. 28: Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure across the country, including the far-western regions. Russian forces launched more than 180 drones and missiles at Ukraine, successfully hitting 12 sites of fuel and energy infrastructure, according to the Air Force. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at Ukraine&apos;s power grid. Emergency blackouts were introduced in multiple regions across Ukraine. The Air Force announced a nationwide air raid alert after warning that seven Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers took off. Explosions were reported in multiple cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Lutsk, and Rivne. Local officials also reported strikes in Sumy, Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, and Volyn oblasts. Ukrainian forces shot down 79 out of the 91 missiles and 35 out of the 97 drones, launched by Russian forces, the Air Force reported. Over 60 more drones were countered by the means of electronic warfare. Fragments of a downed Russian Kh-55 missile in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 28, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Russia has already begun redoubling attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid as the country enters its third winter at war. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on Nov. 28 that Russia was deliberately stockpiling weapons, including arms from North Korea, in order to launch mass attacks on cities and infrastructure in winter. &quot;They stockpiled missiles for strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, for warfare against civilians during the cold, during the winter,&quot; Yermak said. Ukraine destroyed a Russian high-value radar station, 48Y6-K1 Podlet, near the village of Kotovske in occupied Crimea on Nov. 28, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. While no further details have been disclosed, HUR claimed to be behind the operation. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Podlet is a modern mobile radar system designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The system has an estimated price tag of around $5 million. The news comes after multiple explosions were reported across Crimea with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. The Netherlands delivered three new Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced on Nov. 28. &quot;This saves lives and protects vital infrastructure. It is and remains in our common interest to stop Russian aggression,&quot; Brekelmans said on social media. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities ahead of winter. Russia launched nearly 100 drones and 90 missiles against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. Additional emergency blackouts were introduced across the country following the attack. &quot;I am grateful to Minister Brekelmans and the Dutch government for strengthening Ukrainian air defense capabilities,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Washington&apos;s decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing five unnamed sources familiar with the intelligence data. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin updated the nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, and Russian government officials continue to criticize the recent White House decision, calling it a push for &quot;escalation.&quot; Despite the Kremlin&apos;s recent statements, the risk of a nuclear attack is unlikely, Reuters reported, citing its unidentified sources. Intelligence assessments over the past seven months have shown that a nuclear escalation is unlikely to result from a decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons. &quot;The assessments were consistent: The ATACMS weren&apos;t going to change Russia&#x2019;s nuclear calculus,&quot; said one congressional aide briefed on the intelligence. Meanwhile, Moscow is expected to expand its campaign of sabotage against European facilities to increase pressure on the West for its support of Kyiv, two high-ranking officials, a lawmaker, and two congressional aides told the news agency. One of the five U.S. officials also noted that unveiling the new missile, referring to the Russian-made Oreshnik, is a step toward escalation. U.S. officials said the intelligence helped guide the contentious debate within the Joe Biden administration over whether Washington should ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons because of the risk of provoking Putin. Russian troops operated a torture chamber in Belarus in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported on Nov. 28. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there. The chamber was located on Belarusian government-owned property in the town of Naroulia, not far from the border with Ukraine, according to BIC. The Russian military has reportedly set up a camp in Naroulia for people captured in Kyiv Oblast during the early stages of the full-scale war. In comments to BIC, human rights activists described the Naroulia camp as a place where the treatment of civilian hostages &#x201C;was among the most brutal.&#x201D; Lawyer Yulia Polekhina, working with the Sich human rights group, said that prisoners were tortured there. Polekhina&#x2019;s words echo those of former prisoners who went through Naroulia. &#x201C;They beat up civilians there really hard. One could hear constant screaming there,&#x201D; said Bohdan Lysenko, a soldier with the Ukrainian Armed Forces who was captured by the Russian military and brought to the camp in March 2022, in a comment to BIC. According to the investigation, the camp was located in the compound owned by Pripyatski Alyans on Kamsamolskaya Street. Owned by the Belarusian state, the company conducts catering and food procurement for regional institutions. The company did not comment on the allegations and advised to contact local authorities for more information. The Reckoning Project, the Ukrainian-American organization that records human rights violations, suggests that the actions of the Russian military in Naroulia may indicate a violation of the Geneva Convention provisions, which prohibit forced displacement of civilians and ban keeping military personnel and civilians at the same detention center. The Russian military was reportedly present at the location at least until early May 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-45/	2024-11-28T11:59:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28_10-56-15.jpg
Zelensky signs law on 'historic' tax increase	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill authorizing a major tax increase on Nov. 28, following more than a month of delay. The bill, which was passed by the Ukrainian parliament on Oct. 10, will raise taxes by Hr 8 billion ($192,000) in 2024 and Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) in 2025, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said, as the country struggles to shore up its budget deficit amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war. The law is expected to come into effect on Dec. 1. One of the provisions of the bill is an increase of the military tax &#x2014; a sum levied from citizens to support the war effort &#x2014; from 1.5% to 5%. An amendment to the legislation left the military tax for military personnel at 1.5%. The bill also introduces a military tax for self-employed persons and increases profit taxes for banks to 50% for 2024 and other financial institutions from 18% to 25% since January next year. Zelensky also signed a bill on the state budget for 2025, passed by the parliament on Nov. 19. All taxes of citizens and businesses will be directed to Ukraine&apos;s defense and security, according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The state expects to get Hr 2 trillion ($48.2 billion) in revenues, while expenditures are planned at Hr 3.6 trillion ($86.8 billion) in 2025. The budget envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). Shmyhal said in August that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though foreign partners have pledged to cover roughly $20 billion of that sum. The proposed tax increase is part of an effort to find additional sources of funding at home, which may also include increased domestic borrowing and measures to boost the number of jobs and wages. Despite the dire budgetary situation, the bill has received criticism due to its potential repercussions on already difficult living conditions in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-2/	2024-11-28T11:15:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/volodymyr_zelenskiy_32.jpg
Ukraine’s fight against Russian invasion undermined by draft-dodging graft	Heavy fighting on the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, dragging out for almost three years, has left thousands of Ukrainian soldiers seriously injured or killed in action. Many still fighting for years along more than 600 miles of the front line in Ukraine&#x2019;s east and south are exhausted as they face what Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces, describes as &#x201C;one of the most powerful Russian offensives.&#x201D; Earlier this year, the government stepped up mobilization to increase the army&#x2019;s ranks by hundreds of thousands, on top of the more than 1 million currently defending the country. Yet, the effort to scale up Ukrainian forces against an enemy with more manpower and weaponry has been tainted by mushrooming corruption scandals. Officials in the Ukrainian healthcare system are suspected of taking bribes to help men avoid mobilization by obtaining fake disability documents through MSEC, the state medical commission responsible for clearing men to be fit to fight. &#x201C;From a human perspective, what jerks,&#x201D; a Ukrainian Special Forces sniper who goes by the callsign Bart told the Kyiv Independent, responding to the alleged corrupt schemes aiding draft dodgers. &#x201C;We do our job (on the front) because someone has to do it. But there are institutions that must make decisions about (corruption),&#x201D; he added. A series of high-profile MSEC corruption scandals last month triggered public outrage and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to act. &#x201C;This is truly an internal enemy,&#x201D; Zelensky said in an address in October, days before signing a decree to liquidate the commissions by the end of the year. Officials say a rebooted, digitized system is to replace them. Reports of abuse date back to the early days of Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war launched in 2022, when hundreds of thousands of men motivated to take up arms lined up at army recruitment centers. But the urgency to squash the schemes has mounted after Ukraine has, years into the war, stepped up forceful enlistment tactics. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi briefs President Volodymyr Zelensky on the battlefield situation on Nov. 25, 2024. (Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The planned MSEC reform, to be introduced next year, will also serve as a litmus test of the Zelensky administration&#x2019;s ability to dismantle lingering corruption in state institutions. Success in this broader effort is vital to boosting public morale, as well as reinforcing the struggling front-line units with new recruits. Ukraine&#x2019;s state network of medical commissions, known as MSECs, decide whether the person is disabled and how severe the disability is.&#x200B;&#x200B; During the war, thousands of wounded veterans had to fight a bureaucratic battle for disability status to be eligible for government payments and benefits, overwhelming MSEC, which provided services to about 2.7 million Ukrainians before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Soldiers often complained about the commission&#x2019;s time-consuming, outdated, and corrupt system, which required large amounts of paperwork and could take as long as three months to grant status. At the same time, many civilian men sought to be granted a disability status that would exempt them from military service in accordance with Ukrainian law. Since the 1990s, the commissions have worked only with paper documents, unaffected by the state&#x2019;s digitalization campaign that boosted Ukrainian mobilization this year. This allowed doctors and experts to decide on people&#x2019;s disability status with barely any oversight.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)It was also up to MSEC members to set a date for a person to return and get their status reviewed. &#x201C;If you have everything on paper, it is impossible to control it properly,&#x201D; said Liubov Halan, co-founder of Pryncyp, the top veteran care reform organization in Ukraine that advocates for the MSEC overhaul. The lack of oversight allowed some officials in MSEC to embrace a flow of bribes from civilians desperate to avoid military service, which have left a smaller pool of potentially less fit conscripts to draw from. Ukraine&#x2019;s government announced a plan to reform the system in May 2023. Yet, it wasn&#x2019;t until several consecutive scandals in October rattled the nation, prompting officials to move toward ground-breaking changes. &#x201C;Lists of &#x2018;draft dodgers&#x2019; with fake diagnosis&#x201D; were found alongside millions of dollars in cash during the search of the apartment of Tetiana Krupa, the head and chief doctor of Khmelnytskyi Oblast&#x2019;s MSEC, the State Bureau of Investigation reported on Oct. 4. &quot;Law enforcement officers found money in the apartment in almost every corner &#x2014; in wardrobes, drawers, niches,&quot; the Bureau&#x2019;s statement read. Soon after, Ukrainian news outlet Censor.NET published an investigation showing that Krupa granted Khmelnytskyi Oblast Chief prosecutor Oleksiy Oliinyk and scores of his subordinates disability status.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Now at least 51 top prosecutors supposed to guarantee the rule of law in the region are suspected of participating in the draft-dodging graft scheme. Apart from avoiding the draft, the alleged scams helped the officials receive outsized government pensions and other benefits. The Prosecutor General&#x2019;s office launched an internal investigation, which also found that 60 prosecutors, an unusually high number, were registered as people with disabilities in Cherkasy Oblast. In the Khmelnytsky and Cherkasy oblast cases, local MSECs declared almost a third of prosecutors unfit to fight, compared to less than 10% in other regions. According to reports by the Security Service of Ukraine, more MSEC workers have been accused of engaging in draft-dodging corruption schemes every week since. The findings pointed to an institutionalized pattern of these schemes between MSEC and the prosecutor offices in at least two oblasts. Krupa&#x2019;s case was the first public expose of a Ukrainian government official outside the military system making millions in wealth by illegally aiding the draft-dodging during the all-out Russian war. It was also a blatant showcase of inequality between the state officials obtaining disability benefits en masse while many wounded Ukrainian soldiers sat in queues for months to do it. Ukrainians wanted the leadership to react, punish corrupt officials, and introduce reforms to the rotten system. Responding to people&#x2019;s needs, Zelensky ordered the dissolution of medical commissions by the end of the year and, in a statement on Oct. 22, said Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin resigned. The Prosecutor General&#x2019;s office launched an investigation into the prosecutors&#x2019; disability statuses. Krupa was detained, while Ukraine&#x2019;s Health ministry dismissed its top officials in charge of MSEC. &#x201C;The president did the (short-term) tactics right,&#x201D; said anti-corruption activist Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center&apos;s executive board. &#x201C;It was necessary to give the public at least the appearance or hope of restoring justice.&#x201D; However, Shabunin and other activists doubt corruption will be eliminated in the system over the long run. Nothing has changed since the corruption scandals in draft offices last year prompted the government to dismiss their heads and promise reforms. &#x201C;The main reform to ensure that there is no corruption in the MSEC is to digitalize the process,&#x201D; Shabunin told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not rocket science,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If this is not resolved again, it means that all these executives are simply incapable of solving these problems.&#x201D; Under Zelensky&#x2019;s presidency, Ukraine has successfully rooted out many layers of choking bureaucracy and room for corruption with reforms that introduced digitization of many public services, most notably through the notorious Diia mobile phone app. Recent efforts to digitize men&apos;s registration as part of the army&#x2019;s mobilization efforts and to provide services to soldiers currently serving have also shown promise. The new digitalization system replacing MSEC is laid out in a reform plan approved by the government on Nov. 20 and was submitted as legislation to parliament to be adopted. The draft law, adopted by lawmakers in a first reading but now awaiting amendments before a final vote, stipulates that current heads of medical commissions are forbidden from participating in expert groups deciding on medical disabilities. The MSEC functions are to be transferred to some regular Ukrainian hospitals.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;The plan has been developed,&#x201D; the Ministry of Digital Transformation said in response to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s inquiry. According to the ministry, the new digital system will free patients from carrying their paper records around for visits to relevant authorities and prevent corruption, as medical experts and patients will not see each other&#x2019;s names. While the MSEC reform was promised by the government over a year ago, activists are concerned that its politically-motivated rushed implementation could hurt the welfare of people with disabilities. &#x201C;What the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Affairs should do for all persons with disabilities, including veterans, is to change the entire approach,&#x201D; Halan said. &#x201C;It is not clear how it will all happen.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-fight-against-russian-invasion-hurt-by-draft-dodging-graft/	2024-11-28T11:05:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149272121.jpg
Ukraine maintains 'good dialogue' with potential Trump's peace envoy, Kyiv says	Kyiv maintains &quot;a good dialogue&quot; with retired U.S. General Keith Kellogg, who was nominated for the post of a special Ukraine peace envoy, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. &quot;Keith Kellogg is not a new person for Ukraine. The Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S. has maintained close ties with him, in particular within the framework of expert diplomacy in recent years, and has developed and maintained a good dialogue with him during this time,&#x201D; Tykhyi told journalists in Kyiv. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump tapped Kellogg for Ukraine peace envoy on Nov. 27, proposing him as a person who potentially can lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;We welcome his nomination for this important mission,&quot; Tykhyi said. In June, Reuters reported that Kellogg and another Trump&apos;s top advisor, Frederick H. Fleitz, proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agreed to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The two also reportedly proposed to freeze the front lines in their current position and take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table. Kellogg, 80, previously served as the executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration. He also was a top advisor to then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. According to the spokesperson, Ukrainian delegations have met with Kellogg on several occasions. Kellogg also was present at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Washington during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speech earlier in July. &quot;We are looking forward to working with him, to even more active interaction with him in his new role. We will cooperate, we will establish contact with him,&quot; Tykhyi added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-has-good-dialogue-with-potential/	2024-11-28T10:55:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg

Russia has terrorized Ukrainians in torture chambers across the occupied territories, with previous reports indicating the use of this tactic in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as the previously occupied areas of Kherson Oblast. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko provided Belarus territory for Russia to launch the all-out war against Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukraine says US landmines are necessary, Trump's ally disagrees	Tucker Carlson, a controversial U.S. political commentator and talk show host with Donald Trump&apos;s ear, has slammed the decision to provide Ukraine with landmines, warning the weaponry Kyiv claims it needs to defend itself from Russia&apos;s invasion will only &quot;kill innocents.&quot; Carlson is the recent top ally of the U.S. President-elect Trump who had criticized the current administration&apos;s decision to provide Kyiv with additional weapons and permits before the end of its term. &quot;There&apos;s no justification for using anti-personnel mines (APLs) in this conflict, which can&apos;t hope to be solved,&quot; Carlson said in an interview with the Redacted podcast on Nov. 24. Carlson&apos;s comments come nearly three years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, a war in which Ukraine relies on support from the U.S. and other Western allies to defend itself. While the use of landmines in conflicts is controversial, the weaponry has been widely used by both sides in the war. The outgoing administration of Joe Biden and Ukrainian officials insist they are necessary to help Kyiv to defend itself. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister, told the BBC earlier this month that he understands the &quot;moral ramifications for human rights defenders&quot; regarding APLs posing a risk to civilians. &quot;But we&apos;re fighting a war against a vicious enemy, and we must have the right to use everything we need within the realm of international law to defend ourselves,&quot; Kuleba added. Biden, on Nov. 19 authorized the transfer of APLs for Ukraine in response to Russia&apos;s grinding offensive advancing in the eastern Donetsk Oblast, which has gathered pace in recent weeks. The controversial move comes after another major policy shift, in which the Biden administration allowed the use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles deep inside Russian territory. Earlier in June 2022, the White House announced the U.S. would no longer produce or transfer the mines, aiming &quot;to curtail the use of APLs worldwide.&quot; But in explaining the change in policy, and the decision to provide them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN that &quot;the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they&apos;ve kind of changed their tactics a bit.&quot; Thus, Ukraine needs &quot;things that can help slow down that effort,&quot; Austin added. &quot;Landmines could help minimize Ukrainian casualties by reducing the need for soldiers to enter certain battle zones,&quot; Jean-Christophe Noel, a research fellow on Security and International Relations at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;By placing mines in key areas, you can block enemy movement. It won&apos;t stop Russian troops entirely, but it can slow them down. Moreover, in case of a front-line crisis, mines will delay Russian forces, giving Ukraine time to react.&quot; An APL is a small explosive device made out of plastic or metal that militaries usually use to hinder advancing enemy troops or vehicles, and protect military positions. Combatants often bury them in the ground or conceal them in buildings. APLs come in different types, each serving a specific purpose. Generally, they explode when a person steps on them, touches them, or comes within a certain proximity. The range of damage and functionality varies depending on the type and size of the landmine. According to Gerald C. Cauderay, a former International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegate, blast mines typically affect an area within one to two meters. Snow-covered land mines are seen in a trench at the position of the Ukrainian military near the city of Horlivka, occupied since 2014 in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Dec. 16, 2023. (Oleh Arkhanhorodsky/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Other types include fragmentation mines, which are designed to injure by throwing shrapnel into the air in a wide radius. U.S. officials are keeping quiet about the specific type of mines that will be sent to Ukraine. &quot;The anti-personnel mines treaty, established decades ago, bans most landmines, allowing only controlled mines like the Claymore, which detonates via controller (remotely) and self-deactivates after a set time,&quot; Mick Ryan, a senior fellow for military studies at the Lowy Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;These may be the type the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine,&quot; he added. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have used landmines heavily during the war. &quot;Ukraine is now the most mined country in the world, with potentially 23% of its land at risk of contamination with landmines and unexploded ordinances,&quot; the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said in a report this month. Although international law does not prohibit the use of APLs, over 160 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty in 1997 &#x2014; the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention &#x2014; which bans the creation, production, storage, and use of landmines. Ukraine is a signatory of this treaty, but neither the U.S. nor Russia has signed it. Human rights activists and international organizations are warning about the risks posed by APLs in Ukraine to civilians now, and in the future.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;President Biden&apos;s decision to transfer anti-personnel landmines risks civilian lives and sets back international efforts to eradicate these indiscriminate weapons,&quot; said Mary Wareham, Human Rights Watch (HRW) director. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an independent humanitarian organization, is concerned about the indiscriminate impact of landmines on civilians who are not part of the fighting. &quot;We (the ICRC) can see that the rhetoric regarding the allowance of weapons has changed in the war between Ukraine and Russia because there are an increasing number of Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure, including electricity, heating, and water systems, worsening people&apos;s living conditions,&quot; Patrick Griffiths, a Red Cross spokesperson in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;However, the ICRC does call to respect the international treaties regarding the use of weapons. It&apos;s important to ensure that any use stays within the international humanitarian law,&quot; Griffiths added. Trump, who is to take over as president in January 2022, has not himself commented on the provision of APLs to Ukraine. But he has pledged to swiftly end the war, hinting that Ukraine could have to make some concessions. Carlson went on to describe President Volodymyr Zelensky as undemocratic and his country&apos;s fight for survival as a nation as not worth supporting. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a matter of defending democracy,&quot; Carlson said.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)&quot;The president of Ukraine is not elected. He&apos;s a dictator. He literally passed his term and kept serving,&quot; Carlson said. Holding national elections in Ukraine is not permitted under martial law, a measure that was taken as a result of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. Carlson&apos;s comments are likely to deepen concern in Kyiv that Trump could cut U.S. military support for Ukraine in a bid to pressure it into concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-ally-tucker-carlson-slams-biden-for-giving-ukraine-land-mines-says-killing-is-the-point/	2024-11-28T09:04:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1519653702.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian $5 million radar system in Crimea, military intelligence claims	Ukraine destroyed a Russian high-value radar station, 48Y6-K1 Podlet, near the village of Kotovske in occupied Crimea on Nov. 28, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. While no further details have been disclosed, HUR claimed to be behind the operation. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Podlet is a modern mobile radar system designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The system has an estimated price tag of around $5 million. The news comes after multiple explosions were reported across Crimea with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in the occupied peninsula during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-says-it-destroyed-russian-5-million-radar-system/	2024-11-28T09:03:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/462399914_3893767737532620_3969538192184221239_n.jpg
Putin threatens to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv with Oreshnik missile	&quot;Decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv can be among the targets of Oreshnik, Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Nov. 28. Putin has repeatedly threatened to attack Ukraine&apos;s &quot;decision-making centers&quot; since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Russia daily strikes Ukrainian cities with drones, missiles, and guided bombs, with nearly 200 aerial targets launched at Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28. Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin said that Russia&apos;s military leadership is now &quot;choosing targets&quot; in Ukraine to hit them with Oreshnik. &quot;These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv,&quot; Putin said. Russia first launched Oreshnik in an attack against the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon,&quot; which later was refuted by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia&apos;s Oreshnik attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted more such strikes against targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts had followed later. According to Putin, Russia has begun mass production of Oreshnik. Previously, a U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow likely possesses &quot;only a handful&quot; of these experimental missiles. &quot;In the case of a mass use of these missiles, the power of this strike would be comparable to the use of nuclear weapons. Although Oreshnik is not a weapon of mass destruction,&quot; Putin added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Experts have called into question his claims regarding the weapon&apos;s novelty. Analysts, including Pentagon officials, have said the missile appears to be based heavily on Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. The missile fired at Ukraine a week ago carried warheads without explosives, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing two unnamed senior Ukrainian government sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-to-target-decision-making-centers-in-kyiv-with-oreshnik-missile/	2024-11-28T08:11:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186536972.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 155	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 155 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Nov. 18-24, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. State 2025 budget projects Hr 66.01 billion ($1.6 billion) in SOE net profit and dividends. On Nov. 19, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, approved Draft Law No. 12000 &#x201C;On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2025.&quot; According to that law, the state budget projects a revenue of Hr 66.01 billion ($1.6 billion) in SOE net profit and dividends. This would make up 2.85% of the expected state budget revenues, which are projected at Hr 2.32 trillion ($55 billion). Ukrenergo gets a new executive board member. On Nov.22, Ukrenergo announced that Vitalii Zaichenko, director for managing the Integrated Power System (IPS of Ukraine) and chief dispatcher of Ukrenergo, joined the company&#x2019;s executive board. Zaichenko will continue performing his responsibilities as the chief dispatcher, the company said. He will also oversee the coordination of parallel operation of the IPS of Ukraine with ENTSO-E. According to Ukrenergo, Vitalii Zaichenko began his career as an engineer specializing in the optimisation of electric modes at Ukrenergo back in 1996. He actively participated in creating the Burshtyn TPP Island and enabling the synchronous operation of the IPS of Ukraine with ENTSO-E, the company added. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine will have access to about $1.1 billion. According to the IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the Ministry added back then. The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. The first and foremost task of the new supervisory board would be to conduct a transparent competitive selection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO, the ministry also said. HACC does not extend pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. On Nov. 20, the Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC) said that the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) had declined to extend pre-trial restrictions for former Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. According to AntAC, the term of pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev expired on Nov. 12. He was required to report any change of residence, refrain from communicating with witnesses, and surrender his passports for international travel. The Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) filed a motion with the HACC to extend the term of Kobolyev&#x2019;s duties on Nov. 1. However, the HACC hearings on Nov. 5 and 8, which were supposed to consider this motion, were cancelled. Instead, on Nov. 1, the HACC granted Kobolyev permission to travel abroad from Nov. 4&#x2013;25 , AntAC added. However, no trips abroad occurred, AntAC added, and Kobolyev said that he remained in Kyiv. He added that he has not missed a single court hearing and, despite the end of his restrictions, would not be running away. Kobolyev also said that he would attend the next court hearing, scheduled for Nov. 26, as usual, in person. As we reported in Issue 71, on Jan. 19, 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and SAPO charged Kobolyev with illegally awarding himself Hr 229 million, part of a bonus given to the Naftogaz team for their victory against Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom in Stockholm&#x2019;s court of arbitration in 2018. Hr 229 million was $8.8 million or &#x20AC;7.6 million at the time when bonuses were awarded. On Aug. 9, 2023, HACC decided to extend the Hr 229 million bail ($6.1 million or &#x20AC;5.6 million at that time) for another two months and left Kobolyev&#x2019;s procedural obligations, including pre-trial restrictions, unchanged. See SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 99 for details. On Sept. 25, 2023, HACC removed the electronic ankle monitoring device from Kobolyev and halved his bail to the amount already paid, Hr 107 million ($2.9 million or &#x20AC;2.8 million). See Issue 104 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 113, on Nov. 29, 2023, SAPO said that it filed abuse of office charges against Kobolyev. On Nov. 30, 2023, at the first preparatory hearing on Kobolyev&#x2019;s charges, HACC granted the SAPO prosecutor&#x2019;s motion and extended his procedural duties until Jan. 30, 2024. On Dec. 14, 2023, following the results of the preparatory meeting, the panel of judges at the HACC denied the defense&#x2019;s request to return the indictment, scheduled a hearing on the merits, and commenced a hearing in the Kobolyev case. Since then, the HACC has constantly extended the pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. See Case No. 991/10459/23. In June 2024, Oleksiy Nosov, the lead attorney and communicator in the Kobolyev case on the part of the defense, was detained for a suspected attempt to bribe NABU and SAPO in an unrelated case, after which HACC set bail for him. The case involves an alleged theft of Hr 716 million ($17 million) worth of electricity from Ukrenergo by a group led by Mykhailo Kiperman, a businessman reportedly associated with the Privat group. For an extended background on the Kobolyev case, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79, 83, 84, 88, 91, 99, 104, 113, and 136. For a detailed analysis of this case from a corporate governance perspective, see series of columns by SOE Weekly team members Andriy Boytsun, Oleksandr Lysenko, and Dmytro Yablonovskyi: Are Kobolyev&#x2019;s bonuses a threat to corporate governance reform? Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5. Ukrainian banks post cumulative net profits of Hr 117.63 billion ($2.8 billion) in January-September 2024; state-owned banks make 63% of the total, Opendatabot reported. The data provider also noted that despite the tax, which increased from 18% to 25% this year, the total net profit is 7% higher than the Hr 109.85 billion recorded over the same period of 2023. However, it is somewhat lower if the 2023 profits are converted into euros at the 2023 rate, &#x20AC;2.77 billion. As we reported in Issue 113, in 2023, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law increasing taxes for banks, with some of the key changes concerning the income tax rate. That rate had been 18%, but the law introduced a windfall income tax of 50% for 2023, applied retrospectively. The income tax as from Jan. 1, 2024 was then set at 25%. However, that rate has also been recently increased to 50% retroactively for 2024 as part of the tax increase bill, Draft Law No. 11416-d. The law was adopted by parliament on Oct. 10, but it is yet to be signed by the president to become effective. This means that, once the law is effective, Ukrainian banks will pay Hr 58.82 billion ($1.4 billion) in income taxes for January-September 2024 alone. Five state-owned banks accounted for 63% of Ukrainian banks&#x2019; total profits: As we wrote in Issue 119, the bank reported a net profit of Hr 37.8 billion ($909 million) in 2023. As we reported in Issue 129, PrivatBank paid Hr 50 billion ($1.2 billion) in taxes and dividends. This was as much as 3% of total projected state budget revenues for 2024. As we reported in Issue 128, Oschadbank earned a record Hr 6 billion ($144 million) profit in 2023. In Issue 121, we wrote that Oschadbank paid the state the first half of the 2023 dividends, Hr 0.7 billion ($16.8 million). As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023.&#x202F;See more in our Issue 98. As we wrote in Issue 132, Ukrainian banks posted combined profits of Hr 40 billion ($961 million) in Q1 2024, with state-owned banks making 60% of the total. As we reported in Issue 146, in January-July 2024, banks&#x2019; cumulative profits were Hr 120 billion ($2.8 billion). State-owned banks made 63% of the total. Ukrnafta acquires a 51% stake in Shell&#x2019;s Ukrainian petrol station chain, becoming the largest player in the market. On Nov. 19, Naftogaz Group announced that Ukrnafta, one of its subsidiaries, had signed an agreement with Shell to acquire a 51% stake in Alliance Holding LLC. The price of the deal was not disclosed. EP&#x2019;s source at Ukrnafta also refused to name the price, saying that it was &#x201C;very reasonable.&quot; According to EP&#x2019;s and Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources, the main part would be covered by credit funds. According to EP, if the deal is successfully completed, Ukrnafta&#x2019;s 547 filling stations would be joined by 118 Shell stations, making Ukrnafta the largest player in the retail fuel market in Ukraine. In the coming days, Ukrnafta and Shell will file their application for merger clearance by the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU), a prerequisite for completing the transaction. Following approval, the company will be able to complete the transaction and assume all shareholder rights and obligations, Naftogaz added. Shell ranks among the top 10 chains in Ukraine in terms of sales, with 118 operating filling stations. It was ranked No. 9 for fuel sales in the first half of 2023 and No. 7 for the number of stations, most of which are located in high-traffic areas, Naftogaz also said. According to Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Sergii Koretsky, the company&#x2019;s supervisory board approved this acquisition because it aligns with Ukrnafta&#x2019;s development strategy. All Shell&#x2019;s filling stations would be rebranded over the course of the year. Existing B2B contracts would be fully fulfilled, and its staff of 1,550 employees retained, Koretsky explained. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source at Ukrnafta also did not rule out the possibility of the company attempting to acquire the 49% stake held by State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) to gain full ownership of the chain. As we reported in May 2024 (Issue 130), the SPFU said that it obtained control over 49% of the share capital of Alliance Holding LLC, which operates Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine. Alliance Holding was previously owned by Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, who also owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine. As we also wrote in Issue 130, on Oct. 4, 2023, the Justice Ministry filed a lawsuit with the HACC to seize Khudainatov&#x2019;s assets, which included Alliance Holding. In January 2024, the HACC refused to seize a stake in Alliance Holding. The reason was that Shell had increased its stake in the Ukrainian subsidiary after the full-scale invasion to 97.4% via two recapitalisations. The share of the company, which the Justice Ministry associates with Khudainatov, was diluted to 2.6%. The Justice Ministry appealed, and on April 2, the Appeals Chamber of the HACC allowed the nationalization of a 49% stake in Alliance Holding LLC. According to Forbes Ukraine, the court agreed with the ministry&#x2019;s argument that Shell had diluted Khudainatov&#x2019;s stake after he was sanctioned. &#x201C;There has been a violation of Ukraine&#x2019;s public order and a dilution of the sanctioned person&#x2019;s share bypassing the sanctions,&#x201D; the media&#x2019;s source said. Shell then said that Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;unjustified appropriation of (the company&#x2019;s) foreign investments and assets is contrary to international law protecting international investors.&#x201D; The company would do everything it could to protect its employees, assets, investments, and reputation, Shell added. As we reported in November 2024 (Issue 154), the SPFU said that it was preparing to privatize its 49% stake in the Shell petrol station chain. Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) said that Shell&apos;s history in Ukraine was complicated. At first, the company was forced to abandon a gas production project in Donetsk oblast, followed by the annexation of Crimea and the loss of some petrol stations. Later, Shell terminated the agreement on gas production in Kharkiv oblast. After that, according to the market participants interviewed by EP, it was only a matter of time before Shell completely exited the Ukrainian market. EP also said the reason was the HACC&#x2019;s decision (discussed above) to seize 49% of Alliance Holding from Khudainatov. According to the media outlet&#x2019;s sources, negotiations on the possible sale of the stake began in the summer of 2024. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source confirmed this, noting that Shell did not want to be in partnership with an unpredictable company that would win the SPFU auction. This is not the first time since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion that Ukrnafta has gained control over other petrol station chains. As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta manages the seized assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the AMCU allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco&#x2019;s assets &#x2014; see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets. &#x2013; see Issue 124. As we wrote in Issue 137 (June 2024), Ukrnafta also got permission to manage the seized Tatneft Group&#x2019;s assets. According to Ukrnafta, the assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial properties &#x2014; a total of 110 units. See Issues 99, 100, 131, and 137 for more detail. EBRD lends 50 million euros to help Kyiv prepare for winter, the bank&#x2019;s press office announced on Nov. 19. This loan will help to ensure the provision of vital municipal services in Kyiv and mitigate the effects of the ongoing war, the EBRD explained. A first-loss risk cover guarantee from the EU will cover 25% of the loan. This guarantee is vital to the transaction, helping the city and its key municipal utility to immediately address critical liquidity needs and ensure uninterrupted provision of essential public services, the bank also said. The EBRD loan will be co-financed by a 5-million-euro grant from the U.S. &#x201C;The loan will provide liquidity to the city&#x2019;s municipal district heating utility, Kyivteploenergo, ensuring that it remains operational and can retain its existing workforce, continuing to provide vital heating and electricity to the city&#x2019;s residents (including internally displaced Ukrainians who have moved to Kyiv), businesses and other municipal companies,&#x201D; the EBRD added. According to the EBRD, Kyivteploenergo also generates a significant amount of electricity for Kyiv and the country as a whole. These emergency funds are expected to support repairs to the city&#x2019;s damaged infrastructure in preparation for the impending winter heating season. Italy confirms its commitment to provide a 200-million-euro loan for Ukrhydroenergo alongside the EBRD, the company&#x2019;s press office announced on Nov. 21. According to the agreement, signed in February 2024, the loan will be used to purchase critical equipment for the Dnipro and Seredniodniprovska hydroelectric power plants (HPPs), as well as to provide emergency liquidity support to Ukrhydroenergo to ensure the company&#x2019;s sustainability. As we wrote in June 2024 (Issue 135), Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso signed a memorandum of understanding on an energy security emergency response program. Under the agreement, the EBRD will mobilize additional funding of more than 300 million euros to boost Ukraine&#x2019;s energy security. The funds are designated for Ukrenergo, Ukrhydroenergo, and Ukrnafta. See Issue 135 for more detail. The 2025 state budget projects Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) of privatization proceeds. According to the Draft Law No. 12000, approved by the Verkhovna Rada on Nov. 19, the state budget projects Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) in privatization proceeds for 2025. That is as little as 0.13% of the expected state budget revenues in 2025, which are planned at Hr 2.32 trillion ($55 billion). This includes projected revenues from both large and small-scale privatization. In the past years, both planned and actual revenues from privatisation have been historically low. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2023 annual revenue from privatization to the state budget was projected to be Hr 6 billion, or around $144 million. However, the SPFU failed to fulfil this plan (se Issue 114 for more detail). Note that in 2023, only small-scale privatization auctions were held, and no large-scale privatisation deals were made. As we wrote earlier, the state budget envisages Hr 4 billion ($96 million) of privatization proceeds for 2024. As we discuss below, the SPFU has already achieved that target. The winning bidder pays for UMCC. On Nov. 18, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) announced that Cemin Ukraine LLC, the winner of the privatization auction, had fully paid Hr 3.94 billion ($95 million) for United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC). According to the privatisation terms, the winner must maintain UMCC&#x2019;s core business and invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.6 million) in technical re-equipment and modernization. In addition, it must pay off overdue accounts payable (Hr 609 million or $14.6 million as of the end of March 2024) and wage and budget arrears, if any, at the time of transfer of ownership, the SPFU explained earlier. As we wrote in Issue 151, the SPFU sold UMCC on Oct. 9. According to the SPFU and Prozorro.Sale, the only bidder, and, accordingly, the winner, is Cemin Ukraine LLC, owned by Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Hasanov. Hasanov is the owner of the Azerbaijani NEQSOL Holding, which is known in Ukraine for being the owner of the telecom company Vodafone Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, NEQSOL also owns the telecom operator Bakcell. Besides, NEQSOL has extensive experience in the mining business. See more on Hasanov in Issue 151. UMCC is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest titanium ore concentrate mining and processing company. It comprises the Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Irshansk Plant in Zhytomyr oblast. This was not the first attempt to sell the company. As we wrote in Issue 33 three years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that auction because it only had one qualified bidder. The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatisation, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was unreasonable. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company&#x2019;s mineral deposits. The SPFU&#x2019;s auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for more). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for more detail). See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57. As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October 2023 that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant. Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot. The SPFU auction commission determined the terms of UMCC&#x2019;s privatization on May 23, setting the starting price at Hr 3.9 billion (around $90 million at that time). See Issue 133 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 150, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) completed the pre-trial investigation into the Dmytro Sennychenko case, alleging the SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices of embezzling millions from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and UMCC in 2019-2021. See our Issues 80, 83, 105, 106, 109, 117, 114, 131, and 150 for detail. The sale of UMCC increased privatization proceeds to Hr 9.26 billion ($222 million), the SPFU reported on Nov. 18. Thus, SPFU said, it exceeded its annual privatization revenue target for 2024 by more than 2.3 times. Besides, the buyers&#x2019; obligations to pay accounts payable of the SOEs they purchased in the amount of Hr 1.597 billion ($38 million) would also be fulfilled. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projected the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around $96 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated Hr 2 billion ($48 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatization. As we reported in Issue 154, the sale of the Hotel Ukraina, the first large-scale privatization lot, increased privatization proceeds to Hr 5.7 billion ($137 million). In other words, as we wrote, the privatization of Hotel Ukraina alone has generated more revenue than all small-scale privatizations since the beginning of this year. After the buyer paid up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, was achieved for the first time in many years. The sale of UMCC was the second successful auction in the framework of large-scale privatization. The SPFU plans to hold another large-scale privatization auction by the end of 2024. The auction for the sale of AEROC, seized from sanctioned Russian oligarch Molchanov, is scheduled for Dec. 19. The starting price is Hr 965 million ($23 million). See Issue 152 for more detail.

Netherlands hands over 3 Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine	The Netherlands delivered three new Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced on Nov. 28. &quot;This saves lives and protects vital infrastructure. It is and remains in our common interest to stop Russian aggression,&quot; Brekelmans said on social media. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities ahead of winter. Russia launched nearly 100 drones and 90 missiles against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. Additional emergency blackouts were introduced across the country following the attack. &quot;I am grateful to Minister Brekelmans and the Dutch government for strengthening Ukrainian air defense capabilities,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each. Romania transferred a Patriot to Ukraine too after the donation was finally approved in early September. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 27 that key commitments from NATO&apos;s July summit in Washington, including air defense systems and other military support, have not yet been fully implemented.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-hands-over-3-patriot-launchers-to-ukraine/	2024-11-28T07:05:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GddXARzXQAAsH96.jpg
Ukraine withdraws over 20,000 mortar shells due to malfunction	Out of 54,000 120 mm mortar shells suspected of having defects, about 24,000 are to be withdrawn, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 28. He said that it would constitute less than 1% of the defense production in 2024. The mines were domestically produced, according to the people familiar with the matter. Smetanin&apos;s statement follows Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Nov. 26 that it had been investigating the causes of the abnormal malfunction of the 120 mm mortar shells. As the defects were discovered, the ammunition was suspended in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the shells were seized for investigation. One of the manufacturing plants received a complaint about 120 mm shells from the Logistics Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Nov. 20, according to Smetanin. The workgroup worked from Nov. 11 to 15 and concluded that several product components operated abnormally. As a result, some of the ammunitions were of poor quality. Smetanin added that in light of recent reports of mine malfunctions, the latest batches of manufactured arms were being re-tested. &quot;At the same time, all Ukrainian defense companies continue to operate as usual: to manufacture and supply high-quality weapons and military equipment to the Defense Forces,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation around low-quality mines has also become an additional incentive for all manufacturers to be more careful about the quality control of their products at all stages of production.&quot; Earlier, Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of the parliament&apos;s Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, told Suspilne that the Interagency Commission to investigate the malfunctioning of 120 mm mortar shells named lower temperatures and high humidity as the main causes of the defects. Artillery and mortar shells are crucial on the front as Ukraine already struggles to match up with the better-stocked Russian forces. According to ZN news outlet, the supply of the shells in question was a result of a deal between the Defense Ministry and the Strategic Industries Ministry to purchase ammunition from a domestic producer and thus decrease dependence on foreign supplies. The outlet did not name the factory commissioned to manufacture the shells but said it was part of the state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom and was often targeted by Russian attacks. The media investigation highlighted the Defense Ministry&apos;s supposedly inadequate quality control process. Warnings raised by some officials regarding the plant&apos;s ability to produce detonators for the shells &quot;disappeared&quot; during the process, and military officials failed to report initial problems with the shells that surfaced in September. In its statement, the Defense Ministry stressed that the Strategic Industries Ministry was responsible for carrying out the order. Preliminary conclusions named low-quality charges and poor storage conditions as possible causes. Ukraine&apos;s defense sector has been plagued by several major procurement scandals throughout the full-scale war. The two most notorious scandals, one regarding inflated prices for food supplies and the other connected to low-quality winter jackets, prompted the dismissal of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-withdraws-over-20-000-mortar-shells-due-to-malfunction/	2024-11-28T06:04:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820433.jpg
Drones reportedly attack Krasnodar Krai, woman suffers injuries	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) reportedly attacked two settlements in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Nov. 28, injuring a woman, Governor Veniamin Kondratiev claimed on his Telegram channel. In the town of Slavyansk-on-Kuban, drone debris fell into the courtyard of a house, breaking its windows. The owner of the house was injured and received medical treatment at the scene of impact. The drone debris damaged a house in a village in Krasnoarmeysk district. There were no casualties. Later in the day, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that the Russian air force allegedly downed 25 Ukrainian drones, 14 of which were intercepted over Krasnodar Krai. Another six drones were shot down over Bryansk Oblast, three over Russian-occupied Crimea, and two over Rostov Oblast. Ukrainian authorities did not comment on the recent attacks in Russia. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-krasnodar-krai-woman-suffers-injuries/	2024-11-28T05:39:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Russia 'unlikely' to launch nuclear attack despite Putin's threats, US intelligence says	Washington&apos;s decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing five unnamed sources familiar with the intelligence data. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin updated the nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, and Russian government officials continue to criticize the recent White House decision, calling it a push for &quot;escalation.&quot; Despite the Kremlin&apos;s recent statements, the risk of a nuclear attack is unlikely, Reuters reported, citing its unidentified sources. Intelligence assessments over the past seven months have shown that a nuclear escalation is unlikely to result from a decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons. &quot;The assessments were consistent: The ATACMS weren&apos;t going to change Russia&#x2019;s nuclear calculus,&quot; said one congressional aide briefed on the intelligence Meanwhile, Moscow is expected to expand its campaign of sabotage against European facilities to increase pressure on the West for its support of Kyiv, two high-ranking officials, a lawmaker, and two congressional aides told the news agency. One of the five U.S. officials also noted that unveiling the new missile, referring to the Russian-made Oreshnik, is a step toward escalation. U.S. officials said the intelligence helped guide the contentious debate within the Joe Biden administration over whether Washington should ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons because of the risk of provoking Putin. In mid-November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, a decision to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position. His administration previously resisted supplying such weapons over concerns of escalating tensions with Russia. The changes come amid significant challenges for Ukraine, including battlefield losses, reports of North Korea sending troops to support Russia, and Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within 24 hours, but officials worry his administration would cut off aid to Ukraine, undermining its ability to resist Russian aggression. Many U.S. officials now acknowledge that Ukraine could be pushed into talks within months and might be forced to cede territory to end the war, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Nov. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-unlikely-to-launch-nuclear-attack-despite-putins-threats-us-intelligence-says/	2024-11-28T04:30:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Monthly inflation in Russia accelerates, hitting a record number in 2.5 years	Russian monthly inflation in November hit a record high, rising over 1.5 times compared to October, the Moscow Times reported on Nov. 27. According to the Federal State Statistics Service (RosStat), during the week of Nov. 19-25, the consumer price index increased by 0.36%, up 1.15% from the beginning of the month, and over 8% from the beginning of the year. The Russian economy is facing a challenge in light of poor harvest, as well as Western sanctions that have been tightening over the past three years due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Further constraints are caused by the substantial costs of supporting the war in Ukraine, including an increased military budget and domestic military production. Inflation&apos;s biggest impact was on groceries, where prices have risen by a double-digit percentage and continue to rise, according to the RosStat. Since the beginning of the year, the price for potatoes increased by 78.4%, cabbage &#x2014; by 30.7%, and beetroot &#x2014; by 27%. Butter costs 31.6% more, despite the government&apos;s attempts to increase imports from Turkey and Iran. Overall food inflation exceeded 10% for the first time since January 2023, the Moscow Times reported. Meanwhile, the currency value has continued to drop compared to the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Chinese yuan. The ruble exchange rate fell to 15.16 per yuan, 114.50 rubles per dollar and 120.83 rubles per euro, according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Russian Central Bank has decided not to conduct foreign currency purchases from Nov. 28 until the end of 2024. Russia&apos;s ruble suffered a blow following the news that the U.S. had imposed sanctions on 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank. Until now, the U.S. had avoided targeting Gazprombank to enable European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank serves as the main channel for energy-related payments, the Financial Times reported. With this channel closed, international payments for Russian oil and gas will be harder, drying up a part of the Kremlin&#x2019;s foreign currency revenue. The ruble is expected to weaken further with the beginning of the winter holiday season, as companies have to import more goods from abroad to satisfy increased consumer demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/inflation-in-russia-sets-record-since-april-2022-amid-significant-acceleration/	2024-11-28T04:08:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Israel wants Ukraine’s help countering drones	The following is the Nov. 26, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Our most-read article last week was a story about how after Israel repeatedly ignored Ukraine&#x2019;s warnings and offers to help counter the threat of Iranian drones, the tides appear to be turning as Israel faces increased drone attacks. The independent Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim found that after talking with dozens of officials and key individuals in the defense technology sector, early signs of collaboration are emerging as Israeli defense tech companies seek proven, combat-tested solutions. Earlier this year, Shomrim reported that long before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Ukrainian officials had reached out to their Israeli counterparts to share their experience countering Iranian-made drones that Russia began using against Ukraine in 2022. Their warnings were virtually ignored, Shomrim found. A former senior Ukrainian official said at least one Ukrainian company developing anti-drone technology sent representatives to Israel before the outbreak of the war in Gaza &#x2014; but could not find a single counterpart from the defense sector in Israel willing to meet with them at their office. &#x201C;Someone did agree to meet with them at a fast-food restaurant and I believe that was the only meeting. It was a humiliating experience,&#x201D; said the former official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Both current and former Israeli and Ukrainian officials said that Israel paid a heavy price for dismissing those warnings. The Iranian-made drones that are being launched at Israel from Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Iran itself have led to casualties, destruction, fires, and panic and are now the main challenge currently facing Israel&#x2019;s aerial defense systems. The extent of the threat was underscored by the drone that hit and damaged the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea. The Ukrainian companies, for their part, are hoping to grow and profit from the Israeli companies&#x2019; international contacts. Ukraine gained experience from almost three years of war, with over 7,000 drones launched from Russia into Ukraine since the beginning of 2024, including about 2,000 in October alone.

(Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv. Zelensky said that the country&apos;s &quot;food exports provide food for 400 million people in 100 countries around the world.&quot; &quot;Food prices in Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and other countries in Africa directly depend on whether farmers and agricultural companies in Ukraine can operate normally,&quot; Zelensky added. Workers clean debris in a turbine hall full of scorched equipment at a power plant of energy provider DTEK, destroyed after an attack in an undisclosed location in Ukraine on April 19, 2024. (Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Critical financingDTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, is set to receive $112 million from the EU and the U.S. to restore facilities damaged in Russian attacks and help it get through winter. Why this matters: DTEK, as a private energy company owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, has largely been shut out from international financing to make repairs on its critical infrastructure damaged by Russia throughout the war over to its ownership. The newly announced financing is the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion that DTEK is receiving direct financing to help it restore capacity, the company said. Russian attacks destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign in the spring and summer earlier this year. The company put a plan to repair 65% of what was damaged in those months by this winter, but has declined to say publicly how much it was able to repair. DTEK spent around $100 million of its own money last year, and around $65 million this year to repair damages caused by Russian missiles and drones. Reuters reported on Nov. 21 that Russia&#x2019;s missile strikes on Nov. 16-17 hit three of the five operational thermal power plants owned by DTEK, leaving one plant offline. Meanwhile, a controversy over financing DTEK spilled out into public view after Italian media reported that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest institutional investor, will continue to refuse giving any money to the company over the fact that it&#x2019;s owned by an oligarch. In an interview with Italy&apos;s Corrierte della Sera, the bank&#x2019;s president said, without mentioning Akhmetov by name, that the EBRD has &#x201C;very firm ideas&#x201D; on Ukraine freeing itself from the influence of oligarchs, and that &#x201C;accepting compromises on this point would damage the country&#x2019;s prospects in the long term.&#x201D; In a statement, DTEK said it was disappointed by the president&#x2019;s words, writing, &#x201C;The company hopes that the EBRD will further contribute to the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector.&#x201D; &#x201C;DTEK is ready to work with the bank to secure peace and light in Ukraine,&#x201D; the statement read.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Russian assets &#x2014; What will Trump do with them?As Donald Trump prepares to take office this January, one open question remains over how he&#x2019;ll approach the divisive matter of Russian Central Bank assets frozen across the West. So far, Trump has not directly commented on the frozen Russian assets and his unpredictability makes it hard to know which route he will take. Mobilizing the assets and making Russia pay fits in with his strong-man approach but he may also err on the side of caution for fear of foreign countries, like China and Saudi Arabia, pulling out their assets from the U.S., business reporter Dominic Culverwell writes in his latest. He could pressure a reluctant Brussels to pick up the slack and resolve the EU&#x2019;s bickering over the issue. At least for now, it seems unlikely that Trump would unfreeze the assets and hand them back to Russia. &#x201C;There&apos;s no automatic procedure for Trump to get rid of this whole thing entirely,&#x201D; Anna Vlasyuk, a legal research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) told the Kyiv Independent.

(Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Turning drones from low-cost to boutiqueAfter spending around a year piloting mostly reconnaissance drones, Buntar Aerospace founder Ivan Kaunov recognized the need for a more perfect guidance system for drones being used on the battlefield in Ukraine. He assembled a wishlist of the best gear to put into a Ukrainian drone that would be meant for long-term, deep surveillance usage. Kaunov rallied enough interest to translate into funding for a prototype of the Buntar-1, the basis for his current company, Buntar Aerospace. Over the past year, Buntar has armed itself with nearly $3 million in investment from Ukraine, the EU, and the U.S. Kaunov hopes to build what will be the Cadillac of Ukrainian surveillance drones &#x2013; high-cost, premium quality, and repeat usage &#x2014; in a major divergence from the cheap one-time use drones that have become symbols of Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Read the full profile here. Ukraine and the World Bank signed a loan agreement worth $4.8 billion, which Kyiv will use for priority budget expenditures, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22, which falls under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) project. Since the start of the invasion, Ukraine has received around $35.5 billion through the PEACE project. The U.K. has sanctioned the exiled Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, along with Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs, the U.K. government announced on Nov. 21. The statement noted that freezing their assets is part of a crackdown on global corruption and &quot;dirty money.&quot; Firtash allegedly &quot;extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine&quot; and invested significant amounts of the gains in U.K. properties. His wife, Lada Firtash, was also sanctioned as she &#x201C;profited from his corruption and holds U.K. assets on his behalf.&#x201D; Ukraine is &quot;95%&quot; ready to resume commercial flights, but the key remaining factor is to ensure the safety of passengers, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Nov. 21. Speaking with the Suspilne broadcaster, the minister said: &quot;The security architecture requires very serious air defenses... so when we have enough air defense for this or that airport, we will be able to talk about it. Unfortunately, today it is impractical.&quot; Ukrnafta, a state-owned oil and gas extraction company that is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, has bought a 51% stake in Shell&apos;s gas station network in Ukraine, the press service of Naftogaz reported on Nov. 19. Ukrnafta will now hold a majority stake in a network of 118 operational gas stations. Shell, one of Ukraine&#x2019;s top 10 fuel networks, ranks number 9 in fuel sales and number 7 in station numbers, with most stations located in high-traffic areas. All 1,550 employees will keep their jobs, and rebranding is set to be completed within a year. More than two years after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion delayed its release and upended its developers&#x2019; lives, Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot; &#x2014; one of the most anticipated video games of the year &#x2014; was released on Nov. 20. Originally set for a release in April 2022, the game experienced several delays when many of its staff were forced to flee Ukraine that February.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill at least 5, injure 25 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 25 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 28. Russia launched a mass combined attack against Ukraine during the night of Nov. 27-28. In the attack, Russian forces used three S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles, 57 Kh-101 cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers, 28 Kalibr cruise missiles, three Kh-59/69 guided missiles, and 97 drones, according to a report by the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile troops, aviation, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 76 Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles, three Kh-59/69 guided missiles, and 35 drones. Meanwhile, 35 drones were lost on the radars due to electronic warfare operations. During the mass attack, Russian forces targeted several oblasts, including the capital of Kyiv. Critical infrastructure facilities were hit, prompting emergency power outages across the country. A 16-year-old boy and a 90-year-old woman were wounded in an attack in Odesa Oblast. They were treated at the scene of the attack. Falling missile debris damaged six houses, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. A woman in Vinnytsia Oblast was injured in the morning combined attack, said Natalia Zabolotna, deputy head of the regional military administration. The Russian strike against the region damaged residential buildings and destroyed an outbuilding. Apart from the combined mass overnight attack, Russian forces also targeted 10 settlements in Kherson Oblast, including the regional center of Kherson. The Russian attacks resulted in the killing of one person and injuries to 14 others, local military administration reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian FPV (first-person-view) drone hit a tractor in the village of Bilyi Kolodiaz, killing two men and injuring three others, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Donetsk Oblast, one person suffered injuries in the city of Pokrovsk, while in the town of Kostiantynivka, two people were killed due to the Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a woman and two men were injured in the attacks against the Vasyliv district, local military administration said. In Sumy Oblast&apos;s Khotyn community, a drone attack injured a civilian, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-5-injure-25-over-past-day/	2024-11-28T02:25:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28-12_02_41.jpeg

Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine's power grid	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. The Air Force announced a nationwide aerial alert after warning that Russia had launched seven Tu-95 strategic bombers. Explosions were reported in mulitple cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, Lutsk, and Rivne. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at the nation&apos;s power grid, with attacks on energy infrastructure occurring throughout the country. Ukrenergo, the state grid operator, announced emergency blackouts in multiple regions in an effort to safeguard the energy system from Russia&apos;s assault. Russia has already begun redoubling attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid as the country enters its third winter at war. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 24 that Russia had launched more than 800 KAB-guided aerial bombs, nearly 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles over the past week. Along with intensifying aerial strikes, Ukraine has recently faced another threat from Russia: a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) dubbed &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; which Russia launched in a Nov. 21 attack against Dnipro. The attack triggered an emergency meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council on Nov. 26 and renewed calls for advanced air defense systems from Western partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraines-power-grid/	2024-11-27T20:57:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185066674.jpg
Europe in 'actual war' with Russia, former UK intelligence chief says	Europe is not currently in &quot;a pre-war&quot; situation, but in &quot;an actual war&quot; against Russia, former MI6 head Richard Dearlove told Sky News on Nov. 27. &quot;I think we have to face up to the fact that the Russians think they&apos;re in a state of war with us,&quot; Dearlove said. Dearlove&apos;s comments came days after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine risked escalating into a &quot;global conflict.&quot; According to Dearlove, the conflict has already spiraled beyond Ukraine&apos;s borders. &quot;Donald Tusk has referred to it as a pre-war situation,&quot; Dearlove said. &quot;I think he&apos;s wrong. I think it&apos;s an actual war.&quot; Dearlove said Russia was waging a hybrid war against Europe across multiple sectors, involving acts of sabotage and &quot;some very aggressive moves.&quot; Directors of intelligence services in Europe, the U.S., and the U.K. have characterized Russia as &quot;going feral,&quot; he said. Russian special services have been linked to sabotage efforts across Europe, including cyberattacks, espionage, and election interference. Since joining NATO in 2023, Finland has complained of intensifying hybrid attacks from bordering Russia. As Russian aggression mounts, the Western coalition may be facing a split, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming inauguration heralds a shift in Washington&apos;s support for Europe, NATO, and Ukraine. Western nations are now in &quot;a very dangerous situation,&quot; Dearlove said. While Dearlove said it would be preferable for the West to engage in talks with the Kremlin, he warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to cooperate. &quot;I think we&apos;re in a very difficult situation, and Russia is probably better to have some sort of dialogue with them, than no contact at all. So I don&apos;t rule that out,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think at the moment, I&apos;m not sure Russia is in a mood or a situation where it&apos;s going to be very easy to talk to Putin.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-in-actual-war-with-russia-former-uk-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-11-27T18:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1251392843.jpg
White House preparing $725 million military aid package for Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is preparing a new weapons package for Ukraine worth $725 million, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing two unnamed U.S. officials. The Biden administration has pledged to ship as much aid to Ukraine as possible in the coming weeks, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. The new aid package would include landmines, drones, Stinger missiles, and ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), an official familiar with the plan told Reuters. The package will also likely contain cluster munitions, according to a notification seen by Reuters. Congress is expected to receive the formal notification as early as Dec. 2. The exact contents of the aid shipment may change in the coming days before Biden signs off on the delivery. Biden will exercise the Presidential Drawdawn Authority (PDA) to pull the weapons from U.S. stocks. The $725 million marks an increase from recent PDA packages, which are typically well under $5 million. Congress has already allocated between $4-5 billion in remaining PDA funds for Ukraine. Biden has promised to deliver the full amount to Kyiv before Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20 despite logistical hurdles. The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 27 reported that Biden is unlikely to deliver the full amount before the end of his term. As the White House works to speed up weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Biden has also asked Congress to greenlight additional aid funding, Politico reported on Nov. 26. Documents obtained by the outlet show that the administration is requesting $24 billion in military assistance. &#xA0; The rush to fund Ukraine is a direct response to Trump&apos;s avowed skepticism of ongoing U.S. military support for Ukraine. Trump has constistenly said he would seek to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. While the details of his plan remain unclear, some reports indicate it might entail Ukraine ceding territory and at least temporarily foregoing its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-preparing-725-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2024-11-27T17:34:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182722503.jpg
Biden unlikely to deliver full planned multibillion-dollar aid to Ukraine before term ends, WSJ reports	The Biden administration may not be able to deliver the promised multibillion-dollar aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 27. The administration still has $6.5 billion to transfer to Ukraine, but time is running out to use the allocated resources. The Pentagon has reached its monthly limit on weapons shipments and is facing logistical challenges in delivering arms to Ukraine. To exhaust the remaining funds, the U.S. would need to supply Ukraine with approximately $110 million in weaponry daily, amounting to nearly $3 billion in December and January. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s impossible,&#x201D; a congressional source told the WSJ. A Pentagon source stated that the current plan now is to send $500-750 million worth of weapons from U.S. stockpiles to Ukraine each month. These shipments will mainly consist of artillery and ammunition, as they are easier to transport, while larger equipment could take months to arrive. The remaining decisions on aid will likely fall to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-unlikely-to-deliver-full-planned-multibillion-dollar-aid-to-ukraine-before-term-ends-wsj-reports/	2024-11-27T16:16:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147987555.jpg
US urges Ukraine to lower draft age to 18 amid troop shortage, AP reports	The Biden administration is urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 in an effort to increase troop numbers, the Associated Press reported on Nov. 27, citing an unnamed senior Biden administration official. The recommendation is part of a broader push to address Ukraine&apos;s armed forces personnel shortage as the war with Russia nears its third year. &#x201C;The pure math of Ukraine&#x2019;s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight,&#x201D; the official said to AP, adding that Ukraine is not currently mobilizing enough soldiers to replace battlefield losses or match Russia&#x2019;s growing military. The proposal has faced resistance from Kyiv, with Ukrainian officials expressing concerns about the lack of equipment for additional troops and potential economic harm from drafting younger workers. European officials, speaking anonymously, have suggested that Western allies believe Ukraine&apos;s primary issue is a shortage of troops rather than weapons, raising concerns about its ability to sustain operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk border region. The situation has been further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops supporting Moscow&apos;s efforts to reclaim territory lost to a Ukrainian incursion earlier this year. In April, Ukraine passed laws lowering the draft age from 27 to 25, which added 50,000 troops but fell short of the country&apos;s needs. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. The deadline for updating data expired on July 17, 2024. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pushes-ukraine-to-lower-draft-age-to-18-amid-troop-shortage-ap-reports/	2024-11-27T14:04:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Kyiv Independent launches winter merch collection celebrating Ukrainian traditions	Following on from the launch of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s online store this summer, we are unveiling our first-ever winter collection in time for the holiday season. This collection is more than just a celebration of the festive season. It&apos;s a testament to the resilience of Ukrainian culture, a heritage that has faced &#x2014; and continues to face &#x2014; the threat of erasure. For generations, Ukrainians have kept the spirit of their unique Christmas traditions alive, even when those traditions were suppressed under Soviet rule. Now, as Ukraine continues to defend its identity and freedom, these customs hold even deeper meaning. We&apos;ve taken those cherished customs &#x2014; the enchanting &#x201C;Carol of the Bells,&#x201D; the symbolic didukh wheat sheaf, and the vibrant vertep puppet theater &#x2014; and reimagined them in a series of unique designs. Each piece tells a story of resilience, artistry, and the enduring spirit of Ukraine. The main inspiration for the collection was the tradition of vertep: a cherished Ukrainian puppet theater tradition that has been an integral part of Christmas celebrations since the 16th century but was nearly extinguished in Soviet times. Here&apos;s a closer look at some of our favorite pieces: Sokil: This design features a stylized goat&apos;s head (a beloved vertep character) flanked by graceful birds that evoke the angels of the nativity. Woven throughout are floral motifs and celestial stars, symbolizing new life and faith. Didukh: This striking design pays homage to didukh, a handcrafted sheaf of wheat brought into homes during the Christmas season to represent the enduring spirit of ancestors and a deep connection to the land. Carol of the Bells: This embroidered design rings in the holiday spirit with a touch of Ukrainian heritage. This quintessential Christmas melody, originally a Ukrainian New Year&apos;s song titled &quot;Shchedryk,&quot; has a history that speaks to the perseverance of Ukrainian culture. Through the eyes of talented Ukrainian artists Albina Kolesnichenko and Polina Olkhovnikova, these traditions are reimagined with a contemporary touch, a bridge between the past and the future. Explore the collection here and find a gift for yourself or a loved one this winter. By purchasing our merch, you can show your support for our mission of delivering locally sourced, independent journalism from Ukraine to the world.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-launches-winter-merch-collection/	2024-11-27T12:54:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/RUxBqTYw.jpeg
Some commitments from NATO summit in July remain unfulfilled, Zelensky says	Key commitments from NATO&apos;s July summit in Washington, including air defense systems and other military support, have not yet been fully implemented, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Nov. 27. &#x201C;This significantly affects the motivation and morale of our people,&quot; he said, emphasizing the need for timely delivery of promised support. Zelensky also raised concerns about Russia&#x2019;s use of new ballistic missiles, urging NATO partners to provide specific air defense systems that are readily available. &quot;The recent authorization of long-range strikes against military targets in Russia has helped. But the pressure on Russia must be maintained and increased at various levels,&quot; Zelensky added. The two leaders also discussed strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s ties with the United States and other allies, ensuring the execution of existing agreements, and advancing efforts for Ukraine&#x2019;s eventual invitation to NATO. While Ukraine didn&#x2019;t get a firm commitment to join NATO at the alliance&#x2019;s summit this year, the 32 allied countries did declare Ukraine&#x2019;s path to membership &#x201C;irreversible&#x201D;. Along with air defense systems, Ukraine was promised $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements.	https://kyivindependent.com/some-commitments-from-nato-summit-in-july-remain-unfulfilled-zelensky-says/	2024-11-27T12:44:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2150217708.jpeg
Vertep, a centuries-old Ukrainian Christmas tradition	On New Year&#x2019;s Eve in 1972, a group of Ukrainians set out to carol &#x2014; a seemingly innocent holiday tradition. But for the KGB, the Soviet Union&#x2019;s security services, this was no ordinary celebration. As the carolers moved from house to house, their movements were tracked. The artists and human rights activists that went caroling that night were part of a group known collectively as the Shistdesiatnyky, or Sixtiers in English, for the decade they produced their most celebrated work. The group championed Ukrainian culture and called for social justice in an era defined by Soviet repression. Many of them, including the poet Vasyl Stus, were arrested.

(Photo from the criminal file of Stefania Shabatura/ Electronic Archive of the Ukrainian Liberation Movement)The KGB wasn&#x2019;t following the group that night for just any caroling &#x2014; it was Vertep, a centuries-old Christmas tradition that has historically been as political as it is aesthetic, embodying centuries of Ukrainian folk culture. The tradition dates back to the 16th-17th centuries and is still practiced across Ukraine today around the Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s holidays. Originally staged as a traveling puppet theater, it is now performed by carolers who dress up in elaborate costumes and sing songs blending religious and folk themes. The colorful casts can include up to 40 characters, ranging from religious figures, shepherds, and peasants to animals. The precise origins of Vertep remain somewhat of a mystery, even for scholars of Ukrainian folk traditions. Some suggest it arrived in Ukraine from western Europe, though people have differing views on exactly where it began. In western Europe, puppet theaters with religious themes &#x2014; like miracle plays depicting saints&#x2019; lives &#x2014; had captivated audiences since the Middle Ages. Vertep of the Mezhyhiria Puppet Theatre, 1923. (Wikimedia / Mystetskyi Arsenal)Before the second half of the 18th century, when the earliest known text for a Vertep performance was written, this tradition existed as an oral art form. Students of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s oldest university founded in 1615 &#x2014; most likely played a pivotal role in its rise to prominence during the 18th century. By adapting and enriching Vertep with elements of Ukrainian cultural life, the students transformed it into a dynamic expression of local identity and cultural tradition. All of this unfolded within the Ukrainian Baroque, a vibrant era in Ukraine&#x2019;s history spanning the late 16th to 18th centuries. Shaped by the influence of the Cossacks &#x2014; a semi-nomadic warrior society and early champions of Ukrainian independence &#x2014; this period wove together ideas of resilience and a flourishing of artistic and intellectual life, leaving a lasting imprint on the nation&#x2019;s cultural and political identity. The Vertep theater was traditionally envisioned as a two-tiered wooden structure designed to separate the sacred from the secular. The upper level was for the staging of religious performances, while the lower level was reserved for secular works, ranging from somber tragedies to lively comedic satires. These performances were enhanced by carols or instrumental music, adding a rich auditory dimension to the storytelling. Over the centuries, Vertep evolved but remains a cherished embodiment of the Christmas spirit. Modern celebrations can feature caroling groups adorned in traditional Ukrainian folk costumes or dressed as characters from folklore. These groups often incorporate brief theatrical skits into their caroling, paying homage to Vertep&#x2019;s historical roots. A striking centerpiece of the spectacle is the elaborately crafted star (&#x201C;zvizda&#x201D;), symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem that guided the Magi to the nativity. Vertep performances boast a diverse cast of characters. Notably, the first documented performance, recorded in Poltava Oblast in the late 18th century, included 35 characters. In his 1929 scholarly study &#x201C;Ukrainian Vertep,&#x201D; Yevhen Markovskyi delves into a number of historical versions of the tradition, including the Baturyn Vertep, one of the earliest known renditions. Baturyn, located in modern-day Chernihiv Oblast, was a thriving cultural hub and the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate during the tenure of Hetman Ivan Mazepa.

(Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Baturyn Vertep brought together a rich array of characters, including Christ in the manger, the Virgin Mary and Joseph, shepherds, and angels, as well as King Herod, the archangel Michael, and also Death. The narrative&apos;s religious focus centered on the nativity scene, while its secular elements introduced a cast that included a Cossack hero, a young couple, a Romani fortune teller, an elderly Jewish man and woman, soldiers, and a beggar. The Cossack hero in Vertep serves as a powerful symbol of Ukrainian cultural resilience. Pious and courageous yet undeniably charismatic, his performance often brims with humor, adding a dynamic layer to the narrative. At his essence, however, the Cossack embodies the triumph of good over evil, standing as a timeless representation of strength, righteousness, and Ukrainians&#x2019; enduring spirit. The use of satire in Vertep provided a powerful means to confront and publicly critique social injustices. Corrupt noblemen demanding the tribute of the peasantry are not only ridiculed but also often outwitted, effectively subverting the oppressive structures of the social hierarchy. The exaggerated selfishness of these privileged figures served as a comedic tool, but it also highlights their moral shortcomings. In contrast, characters such as the Cossack offer a model for how individuals should rise above the temptations of vice with regard to themselves and their communities. Given its progressive nature, the Soviet regime actively sought to wipe out Vertep, along with other Ukrainian Christmas traditions, such as Malanka, from public life. Religious practices were viewed as a direct challenge to the state&apos;s Communist ideology, threatening the party&apos;s control over the cultural and ideological fabric of society. In an effort to promote a more secular state, the Soviets strategically elevated holidays like New Year&#x2019;s Eve, deliberately sidelining Christmas to reshape Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural identity and suppress its religious roots. It could be argued that once these traditions were labeled as disruptive, they embraced that very designation, as many Ukrainians, resolute in their commitment to preserving their cultural heritage, resisted such efforts. Despite Soviet attempts to suppress them, many Ukrainians succeeded in safeguarding their Christmas traditions. However, the authorities also exploited this resistance as a pretext to target individuals, intensifying their crackdown on cultural expression, such as when the caroling Sixtiers were arrested.

(Artur Widak/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Those who have endeavored to document the Vertep tradition over the centuries have uncovered not only how Ukrainians have preserved this cultural legacy but also how they have enriched it with their own distinct interpretations. Each version of Vertep adds a new layer to the Ukrainian storytelling tradition, further enriching the tapestry of Ukrainian culture and deepening the collective identity of its people. As a writer, 19th-century author Ivan Franko was deeply captivated by the history of Vertep, appreciating not only its rich folk heritage but also its incisive satire, which elegantly critiqued social injustices with both wit and boldness. He understood that trying to capture the diversity of Vertep was vital to preserving the experiences of Ukrainians from all walks of life, especially those who had endured the brutal realities of Russian aggression throughout the centuries. &#x201C;I have no doubt that every newly unearthed text, rescued from oblivion, will contribute at least a small line to the history of our Vertep,&#x201D; Franko wrote in &#x201C;Toward a History of Ukrainian Vertep&#x201D; in 1906. &#x201C;For this reason, they will be recorded, even if only as fragments of our history preserved in folk memory.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/explaining-ukraine-vertep-a-ukrainian-christmas-tradition/	2024-11-27T12:39:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246098344-1.jpg
North Korea supports Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Umerov says	North Korean forces are &quot;actively supporting&quot; Russian attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Nov. 27. Umerov did not specify how Pyongyang aids Russian strikes on energy facilities. Throughout the all-out war, North Korea has become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of ballistic missiles and artillery shells. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. Officials have warned that Russia may continue targeting the energy grid as winter approaches. The Ukrainian minister arrived in South Korea earlier on Nov. 27 and discussed &quot;joint steps to enhance security and stability&quot; with the country&apos;s President Yoon Suk Yeol. Umerov also met with National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. &quot;For the Republic of Korea, these actions pose a serious threat, as North Korean troops are gaining combat experience, which could present additional security challenges in the region in the future,&quot; Umerov said. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that a rapid supply of arms to Ukraine is unlikely due to South Korea&apos;s legal contains on providing weapons to a combat zone. A South Korean official recently said that direct supplies of 155 mm ammunition are not on the table, with Yoon commenting that Seoul is currently looking at the possibility of providing &quot;defensive weapons,&quot; without providing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-supports-russian-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-infrastructure-umerov-says/	2024-11-27T11:59:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185501985.jpg
Ukraine war latest: The Economist estimates 60,000-100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in full-scale war	Key developments on Nov. 27: Between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on, according to estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26. Kyiv has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties, with President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledging only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. Basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence, The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. In turn, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces put Russian overall losses at over 735,000 as of Nov. 27. The losses Russia suffered in the full-scale war are believed to be greater than during all the wars since 1945 combined. According to The Economist, civilian casualties are even more difficult to establish but likely reach many tens of thousands. The U.N. mission in Ukraine verified that 11,743 civilians were killed as of the summer, but the number is likely higher due to Russia barring access for monitors to occupied territories, namely to areas that likely saw the heaviest civilian casualties like Mariupol. Ukrainian drones and missiles attacked the seaside city of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Nov. 27, the city&apos;s Russian-installed proxy head, Mikhail Razvozhayev, claimed. Russian air defenses shot down two missiles and five drones, Razvozhayev said, claiming that the Ukrainian projectiles were downed over the water. Drone debris also reportedly fell near the Kacha highway. The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions and active air defense in Sevastopol, as well as near the Belbek military airfield and elsewhere on the occupied peninsula. The channel also shared a photo of the Nakhimov Naval Academy with smoke coming from behind it. The authenticity of the footage or the cause of the smoke could not be immediately verified. The Mash Telegram channel alleged that around 40 drones, Neptune missiles, and unidentified cruise missiles were flying toward the northwestern part of the Crimean peninsula. All projectiles were shot down, the channel wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian soldiers repelled an attempted Russian offensive in the Zaporizhzhia sector, General Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, said on Nov.27. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, saying Moscow was deploying trained assault groups to front-line positions in mid-November. Ukraine&apos;s Spartan Brigade aerial reconnaissance spotted Russian troops planning to attack the National Guard positions with an infantry group in advance, Pivnenko said, sharing footage showing the attack. He did not specify the scale of the attack or the number of Russian troops involved in the offensive. According to the commander, Russia is mostly trying to conduct assaults and reconnaissance attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector with infantry groups consisting of 3 to 10 people. &quot;The enemy rarely uses equipment,&quot; Pivnenko said. &quot;But our soldiers destroy enemy personnel and firepower quickly and accurately.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated former national security advisor to the vice president, retired General Keith Kellogg, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Trump announced on Nov. 27. &quot;Together, we will secure peace through strength and make America ang the world safe again,&quot; Trump said on his social media network Truth Social. In June, Reuters reported that Kellogg and another Trump&apos;s top advisor, Frederick H. Fleitz, proposed him a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The two also reportedly proposed to freeze the front lines in their current position and take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table. Keith Kellogg, 80, previously served as the Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration. He also was a top advisor to then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. Last week, Reuters reported that Trump was considering his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-the-economist-estimates-60-000-100-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-full-scale-war/	2024-11-27T11:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161908083.jpg

Last week, Reuters reported that Trump may appoint his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-taps-retired-general-keith-kellogg-for-ukraine-peace-envoy/	2024-11-27T10:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg

Baltic, Nordic countries and Poland to step up support to Ukraine 'in coming months'	The heads of government of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, and Sweden agreed to strengthen their support to Ukraine in the coming months to counter Russia&apos;s full-scale war during a summit in Harpsund on Nov. 27. Baltic and Nordic countries as well as Warsaw have been Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the all-out war, providing the country with military, financial and humanitarian aid. &quot;Ukraine must be able to prevail against Russia&#x2019;s aggression, to ensure a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,&quot; the nations&apos; joint statement read. &quot;In the coming months, we will step up our support, including to the Ukrainian defense industry, and we will invest in making more ammunition available to Ukraine.&quot; The announcement come at a critical time, as Moscow&apos;s forces make their fastest gains in months in Ukraine&apos;s east and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The countries described Russia as &quot;the most significant and direct threat to our security in the long term.&quot; According to the statement, the countries support expanding sanctions against Moscow and strengthening their defense and resistance against conventional and hybrid attacks. &quot;We will work together to constrain, contest and counter Russia&#x2019;s aggressive and highly confrontational actions as well as to ensure its full international accountability for the crime of aggression,&quot; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-nordic-countries-poland-to-step-up-support-to-ukraine-in-coming-months/	2024-11-27T09:07:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GdZSZ-sXoAADSQo.jpg
Ukraine approves homemade Oncilla-Shturm armored personnel carrier for military use	The Ukrainian-made Oncilla-Shturm armored personnel carrier has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry said on Nov. 27. &quot;The domestic Oncilla-Shturm armored vehicle demonstrates Ukraine&apos;s progress in creating equipment that meets the modern needs of the battlefield,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov said. The vehicle can carry three crew members and six riflemen. The Oncilla-Shturm armor protects soldiers from small arms fire, debris and explosive ordnance, according to the ministry. &quot;Its reliability and functionality allow our military to perform combat missions in highly complex conditions, ensuring the protection of personnel and the effectiveness of operations,&quot; Klimenkov said. Armed with a remote-controlled combat module with a large-caliber machine gun, the vehicle can cover travel more than 700 kilometers (434 miles). The Oncilla-Shturm can be produced in several modifications, the ministry said. Kyiv began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which includes long-range missiles and drones. Ukraine&apos;s budget for 2025 envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-homemade-oncilla-shturm-armored-personnel-carrier-for-military-use/	2024-11-27T08:13:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/whatsapp_image_2024_11_27_at_11_52_10_1aedfd416e.webp
Ukrainian soldiers repel attempted Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia sector, National Guard commander says	Ukrainian soldiers repelled an attempted Russian offensive in the Zaporizhzhia sector, General Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, said on Nov.27. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, saying Moscow was deploying trained assault groups to front-line positions in mid-November. Ukraine&apos;s Spartan Brigade aerial reconnaissance spotted Russian troops planning to attack the National Guard positions with an infantry group in advance, Pivnenko said, sharing footage showing the attack. He did not specify the scale of the attack or the number of Russian troops involved in the offensive. According to the commander, Russia is mostly trying to conduct assaults and reconnaissance attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector with infantry groups consisting of 3 to 10 people. &quot;The enemy rarely uses equipment,&quot; Pivnenko said. &quot;But our soldiers destroy enemy personnel and firepower quickly and accurately.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov.25 that Ukraine &quot;sees the existing threats&quot; in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-halt-russian-attempted-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-sector-national-guard-commander-says/	2024-11-27T07:25:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-27-165058.png
Opinion: Georgescu’s rise exposes the fragility of Romania’s pro-European consensus	The meteoric rise of hardcore nationalist C&#x103;lin Georgescu in Romania&#x2019;s first-round presidential election over the weekend is nothing short of remarkable. Georgescu surged from just a few percentage points in polls weeks before the vote to claim over 23% of the electorate, defeating candidates from the country&#x2019;s two most established parties. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and former Liberal (PNL) Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuc&#x103; of the National Liberal Party (PNL) finished third and fifth, respectively. Since the fall of Communism in 1989, PSD and PNL candidates have typically dominated second-round runoffs. Georgescu will now face the pro-European Union reform candidate from the USR party, Elena Lasconi, in the Dec. 1 runoff. Georgescu&#x2019;s victory is being framed as another win for a politician sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following the likes of Viktor Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary, Robert Fico in Slovakia, and the Georgian Dream party in Georgia. Georgescu has openly expressed admiration for Putin, shared panels with Russian nationalist thinker Alexander Dugin, and criticized Western and NATO policies toward Ukraine and the region. While there are elements of pro-Russian, anti-Western rhetoric in his campaign &#x2014; tapping into widespread war fatigue in Romania and across Europe &#x2014; there are broader implications to consider. Georgescu&#x2019;s campaign underscores the power of social media in modern elections and the potential risks to democratic integrity. His last-minute, highly effective outreach on TikTok and other platforms connected with a broader, particularly younger, audience. While this can be celebrated for expanding political engagement, concerns remain over campaign financing and the truthfulness of such efforts. Allegations of Russian funding and bot activity &#x2014; similar to issues raised during Moldova&#x2019;s recent presidential election &#x2014; have raised questions about foreign interference and electoral fairness. Populism thrives in the current global political climate, fueled by concerns over immigration and the lingering effects of the cost-of-living crisis post-COVID. Georgescu&#x2019;s campaign, like MAGA in the U.S., resonates with disenchanted voters who feel ignored by establishment parties. His messaging combines nationalism with a dose of xenophobia, appealing to socially conservative and economically strained constituencies. Georgescu&#x2019;s rise reflects a broader trend of incumbent parties losing ground globally, from U.S. President Joe Biden and the Democrats in the U.S. to the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x2019;s Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey to Narendra Modi&#x2019;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. In Romania, the PSD and PNL are facing unprecedented challenges, mirroring the struggles of governing parties in other democracies.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Liberal politicians in Western democracies may be overestimating public support for progressive reforms. In socially conservative countries like Romania, campaigns emphasizing &#x201C;traditional values&#x201D; often gain traction by opposing liberal policies, particularly those related to LGBTQ+ rights. Putin and similar figures exploit this divide, presenting themselves as defenders of tradition while masking autocratic and kleptocratic practices. In Romania, many rural voters perceive the EU as both a source of funding and a purveyor of socially liberal policies that conflict with their values. Despite Georgescu&#x2019;s first-round success, all is not lost for pro-EU forces in Romania. First, Georgescu secured only 23% of the vote in the first round. Even if votes from nationalist candidate George Simion are added, his total would still fall short of the 50%-plus-one needed in the runoff. Meanwhile, pro-EU candidates collectively received 58% of the first-round vote. Most parties have endorsed Lasconi, and the PSD leadership is likely to follow, aiming to maintain access to substantial EU structural funds. Second, Romania is the largest net recipient of EU funding, with over 83 billion euros ($87.4 billion) allocated under the 2021&#x2013;2027 budget cycle. These funds account for 3-4% of Romania&#x2019;s GDP annually, covering significant budget deficits. A Georgescu presidency could jeopardize these flows, as seen with Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary. Romanian voters may hesitate to risk economic stability by supporting him. Third, Romania&#x2019;s history &#x2014; its alliance with Nazi Germany during World War II, followed by decades under Soviet control &#x2014; has left deep scars. While Georgescu appeals to a conservative base, most Romanians remain wary of Russia. Moldova&#x2019;s recent pro-EU victory in a similar election suggests a comparable outcome is possible in Romania. And finally, Romania&#x2019;s parliamentary-presidential system restricts the president&#x2019;s authority. Without a strong party base, Georgescu is unlikely to dominate parliamentary elections, which will likely result in a fragmented legislature. A pro-EU coalition remains the most viable path to a stable majority, ensuring Romania&#x2019;s Western orientation endures even if Georgescu wins the presidency.	https://kyivindependent.com/opinion-georgescus-rise-exposes-the-fragility-of-romanias-pro-european-consensus/	2024-11-27T06:11:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
South Korean president meets Ukraine's delegation to discuss Moscow-Pyongyang ties	South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Seoul on Nov. 27 to discuss the deepening military ties between Russia and North Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. Several media outlets reported that the Ukrainian delegation is visiting Seoul to seek arms supplies, something the East Asian country has been reluctant to provide. More recently, Yoon said that the South Korean government is not ruling out changing its stance and providing defense support in light of North Korea&apos;s dispatch of troops to Russia. During the meeting, the two sides &quot;agreed to continue sharing information on North Korea&apos;s troop deployment to Russia and on weapons and technology transfers between Russia and North Korea, while working together with allied nations,&quot; the South Korean Presidential Office said, according to Yonhap. Ukrainian officials also reportedly met with National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun to discuss intelligence on North Korean troops. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Neither the Ukrainian delegation nor South Korean officials commented on whether Umerov arrived in Seoul to seek military supplies. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that a rapid supply of arms to Ukraine is unlikely due to South Korea&apos;s legal contains on providing weapons to a combat zone. A recent poll also showed that while the majority of South Koreans see the growing Russian-North Korean ties as a threat, 82% oppose sending arms to Ukraine. According to the experts, South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. A South Korean official recently said that direct supplies of 155 mm ammunition are not on the table, with Yoon commenting that Seoul is currently looking at the possibility of providing &quot;defensive weapons,&quot; without providing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-yoon/	2024-11-27T05:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161646683.jpg
Slovak PM accepts Putin's invitation to Moscow Victory Day celebrations	Slovakia&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May, Fico announced on Nov. 27. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. &quot;The Red Army and the nations of the former Soviet Union played an irreplaceable role in defeating fascism and the victory in World War II,&quot; Fico said on Facebook. &quot;The Slovak government values the legacy of the struggle against fascism, the historical truth about World War II, and the role played by the Red Army... That is why I was happy to accept the official invitation by Russian Presiden Vladimir Putin to attend these important celebrations, which I will.&quot; Fico&apos;s planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU. The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II. Putin has repeatedly hurled false accusations of fascist and Nazi tendencies against the Ukrainian government after the EuroMaidan Revolution, presenting the full-scale invasion as an effort to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; the country. Echoing the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda talking points, Fico said in 2023 that the war in Ukraine began in 2014 because of &quot;Ukrainian fascists&quot; killing &quot;ethnic Russian civilians.&quot; He also said this year in September that some of Ukraine&apos;s units have links to fascism and Nazism, leading to a rebuke from Kyiv. Last month, Fico appeared in an online interview with sanctioned Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, claiming that the West grows tired of supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-victory-day-moscow/	2024-11-27T05:12:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Opinion: Georgia’s civil society is the last line of defense for democracy	Georgia finds itself at a crossroads. The Oct. 26 elections, in which the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory, have brought to the surface deep concerns about the integrity of our democracy. Civil society organizations, independent media, and the international democratic community have all raised alarms about widespread irregularities during the vote &#x2014; violations that are hard to ignore. Moreover, the Georgian Dream party has systematically worked to silence independent voices and consolidate power. This assault on civil society, reminiscent of Russia&#x2019;s playbook, threatens to derail Georgia&apos;s European aspirations but has not broken the spirit of our resilient civil society. The recent adoption of legislation mirroring Russia&apos;s notorious &#x201C;foreign agents&#x201D; law represents a direct attack on Georgia&apos;s vibrant civil society and independent media landscape. This law, coupled with the ruling party&apos;s abuse of administrative resources and pressure on democratic institutions, reveals a troubling pattern: Georgian Dream appears more focused on maintaining power than on fulfilling the Georgian people&apos;s European aspirations. The consequences of these actions are already visible. The European Union, concerned by the worsening democratic backsliding and violations of the rule of law, has effectively paused Georgia&apos;s integration process. It is a bitter blow for many Georgians, who have repeatedly expressed overwhelming support for European integration through peaceful protests, civic activism, and electoral participation. Amid these challenges, Georgia&#x2019;s civil society has shown remarkable resilience. Ahead of the elections, Georgian Dream, determined to minimize independent oversight and criticism, took further drastic measures. However, these challenges have only strengthened our resolve. Georgia&apos;s civil society has decades of experience operating under pressure. We understand that our work is more crucial now than ever. Civil society organizations in Georgia have faced significant pressure under the Georgian Dream that reflect a broader pattern of efforts by the ruling party to control political discourse and suppress opposition from civil society, undermining the critical role that CSOs play in holding the government accountable. Many CSOs report being subject to smear campaigns and negative media coverage, often being portrayed as foreign agents or enemies of the state. Employees and their family members have received anonymous threatening calls related to their work, while their offices and homes have been vandalized with insulting and threatening messages. Despite facing unprecedented pressure, our organizations have managed: to monitor electoral processes and document violations; provide crucial support to vulnerable populations, filling gaps in social services; advocate for media pluralism, judicial independence, and anti-corruption reforms; and facilitate dialogue between Georgian society and European partners.

(Vano Shlamov / AFP via Getty Images)The ruling party&#x2019;s attempts to label civil society organizations as an &quot;enemy&quot; deliberately misrepresent our role. We are Georgian citizens working tirelessly for our country&#x2019;s democratic development. Our work serves the interests of Georgian society. The international community&#x2019;s role remains vital. While Georgian Dream may attempt to isolate civil society domestically, our international partners&#x2019; continued support and engagement provide essential backing for democratic forces within Georgia. This support must continue and intensify, focusing on facilitating contacts between Georgian citizens and the EU, monitoring and responding to democratic backsliding, and supporting independent media and civil society organizations. Despite the challenges we face, Georgia&#x2019;s civil society remains committed to our European future. Our work is not just about defending specific organizations or laws; it&#x2019;s about defending the values that Georgia&#x2019;s democratic future depends on. We continue to fight, knowing that the road to Europe runs through a strong, independent civil society. The government&#x2019;s pressure tactics may create obstacles, but they will not stop us. Our message to the international community is clear: Georgia&#x2019;s civil society stands firm. We need your continued support to overcome these challenges and restore momentum toward European integration. This struggle is not just about today&#x2019;s elections or a handful of laws; it&#x2019;s about the future of Georgia as a democratic, European state. Civil society will continue to fight for a Georgia where democracy isn&#x2019;t just a promise but a reality. The ruling party may try to pull us backward, but we remain focused on the long-term goal: a democratic, European Georgia, where the rights and voices of all its citizens are respected.

The Economist estimates 60,000-100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in full-scale war	Between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on, according to estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26. Kyiv has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties, with President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledging only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. Basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence, The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. In turn, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces put Russian overall losses at over 735,000 as of Nov. 27. The losses Russia suffered in the full-scale war are believed to be greater than during all the wars since 1945 combined. According to The Economist, civilian casualties are even more difficult to establish but likely reach many tens of thousands. The U.N. mission in Ukraine verified that 11,743 civilians were killed as of the summer, but the number is likely higher due to Russia barring access for monitors to occupied territories, namely to areas that likely saw the heaviest civilian casualties like Mariupol.	https://kyivindependent.com/economist-casualties-estimates/	2024-11-27T04:28:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1770366748.jpg
NGO warns that lack of funding threatens critical medical evacuation work in Ukraine	The international humanitarian organization MOAS&apos;s front-line medical evacuation operation is &quot;on the verge of extinction&quot; due to a lack of funding, the group said on Nov. 27, appealing to the international community to support their work. MOAS&apos;s team of all-Ukrainian medics has been evacuating and keeping alive critically injured troops during the three years of the full-scale war, with the group saying their work has saved 62,000 lives. &quot;Now, with funding virtually exhausted, one of Ukraine&apos;s most remarkable lifesaving operations is on the verge of extinction,&quot; their press release read. The group said that without funding, it can sustain its operations only until the end of 2024. &quot;MOAS is keeping soldiers alive day in, day out. It&apos;s an expensive and challenging business, and we simply can&apos;t continue into 2025 without additional funding,&quot; Christopher Catrambone, MOAS&apos;s founder who has been based in Kyiv since the outbreak of the full-scale war, told the Kyiv Independent. MOAS is now in talks with donors in North America and Europe, as well as the U.K. government, to be able to continue its work next year. &quot;The facts are simple. If we have to stop our operation, huge numbers of Ukrainian soldiers will die. In the words of a Ukrainian general, it will be a complete catastrophe,&quot; Catrambone said separately in the press release. &quot;They&#x2019;re overstretched and cannot do what we do. Nor can any other NGO in Ukraine. That&#x2019;s why today, we are launching this urgent appeal for support. It&#x2019;s our last throw of the dice, it&#x2019;s do or die.&quot; According to MOAS, the monthly cost of a 150-strong medical team with 50 &quot;state of the art ambulances&quot; costs $1 million, comparable to the price tag of a Storm Shadow missile. &quot;We&apos;re incredibly grateful to all the donors who have made our lifesaving operation possible,&quot; Catrambone told the Kyiv Independent, explaining that MOAS&apos;s donors include wealthy philanthropists, tech billionaires, foundations, and smaller donors. The founder said he was unsure why the funding was drying up, suggesting that some had found other causes to support or simply lost interest in the war in Ukraine. &quot;But what I&apos;m focused on is getting donors now so we can continue saving lives at the medical frontline in Ukraine,&quot; he stressed.	https://kyivindependent.com/moas/	2024-11-27T03:39:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/medics.jpg
Ex-Minister Kuleba skeptical about peace prospects during Trump's presidency	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to bring a peace deal to Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin still believes he can achieve all his goals, ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Politico in an interview published on Nov. 27. According to Ukraine&apos;s former diplomacy chief, Ukraine is a &quot;personal obsession for Putin&quot; but also a way to &quot;show to the world how the West is incapable of defending itself or what it stands for.&quot; Trump has criticized military support provided to Ukraine by the Biden administration and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. While the details of his plans remain elusive, some reports indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Trump&apos;s approach is more likely to starve Ukraine of weapons and cause the front to collapse, allowing Russian forces to move up to the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Poltava, Kuleba said. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky also cannot sign a peace deal that would recognize occupied territories as Russian and forego Kyiv&apos;s NATO aspirations, as such a step would be against the Constitution and Zelensky&apos;s political end, Kuleba believes. Zelensky recently told Fox News that Ukraine would never recognize Russian occupation but admitted that Crimea would have to be liberated through diplomatic means. He also appealed to the international community to help bring about a diplomatic and just end of the war next year. While voicing hopes that Putin will make a mistake in handling Trump that will antagonize the soon-to-be U.S. president, Kuleba said that Europe&apos;s stance will be decisive. Leading European countries like the U.K., France, and Poland pledged to ramp up their support for Kyiv. The situation in Germany, Ukraine&apos;s largest European donor, remains uncertain as the country is heading toward snap elections in February. The ex-minister also complained that while Russia found allies willing to send their own troops, like North Korea, Kyiv&apos;s partners are unwilling to even commit sufficient weapons. Kuleba concluded that, unlike Russia and Ukraine, the West does not have a clear goal and does not know what it is fighting for.	https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-trump/	2024-11-27T03:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160533255.jpg
Russia claims Ukraine's drones, missiles attacked Crimea, explosion reported near airfield	Ukrainian drones and missiles attacked the seaside city of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Nov. 27, the city&apos;s Russian-installed proxy head, Mikhail Razvozhayev, claimed. Russian air defenses shot down two missiles and five drones, Razvozhayev said, claiming that the Ukrainian projectiles were downed over the water. Drone debris also reportedly fell near the Kacha highway. The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions and active air defense in Sevastopol, as well as near the Belbek military airfield and elsewhere on the occupied peninsula. The channel also shared a photo of the Nakhimov Naval Academy with smoke coming from behind it. The authenticity of the footage or the cause of the smoke could not be immediately verified. The Mash Telegram channel alleged that around 40 drones, Neptune missiles, and unidentified cruise missiles were flying toward the northwestern part of the Crimean peninsula. All projectiles were shot down, the channel wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in Crimea during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimea-attack/	2024-11-27T02:18:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1245749130.jpg
UK cabinet members on list of those barred from entering Russia	Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry barred 30 U.K. nationals, including lawmakers, journalists, and ministers like Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Finance Minister Rachel Reeves, from entering its territory in a decision published on Nov. 26. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and Ed Miliband, the climate secretary, were also on the list. The decision came shortly after the U.K. decided to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territories with Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and after London imposed its largest package of sanctions against Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. In the statement, the Foreign Ministry named &quot;Russophobic policies,&quot; &quot;dissemination of disinformation about our country,&quot; and &quot;military support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces&quot; as indicative of &quot;London&#x2019;s attitude towards further systemic confrontation with respect to Russia.&quot; At the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 20, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government was &quot;doubling down&quot; on its support for Ukraine but avoided disclosing specifics. Ukraine had previously used Storm Shadows against Russian forces in the Black Sea, though the U.K. government has not confirmed the total number supplied since the war began. The sanctions come as the latest turn in a diplomatic spat that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-cabinet-members-on-list-of-those-barred-from-entering-russia/	2024-11-27T01:45:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156747238.jpg
Ukraine receives $4.8 billion from World Bank	Ukraine has received a $4.8 billion loan from the World Bank through the PEACE project for social expenditures, Prime Minister Denys Shymhal said on Nov. 27. &quot;We are very grateful to the United States and the development partners who are financing assistance under the PEACE project,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country. The Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance Project (PEACE) helps to provide funding for pensions, support for internally displaced persons (IDP), and salaries for teachers, first responders, and other state employees. &quot;We thank the World Bank for its continued commitment and active support of initiatives that strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, about $35.5 billion has already been allocated through the PEACE project to support social expenditures of Ukraine&apos;s State Budget, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-4-8-billion-from-world-bank/	2024-11-27T01:09:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg
Russia's ruble sinks to 2022 March levels after US sanctions on Gazprombank	Russia&#x2019;s ruble took a blow following the news of the U.S. imposing sanctions on 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank, hitting 108 against the U.S. dollar during early morning trade on Nov. 27. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials on Nov. 21, sending the U.S. &#xA0;dollar to a more than two-and-a half year high against the rouble. Until now, the U.S. had avoided targeting Gazprombank in order to enable European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank serves as the main conduit for energy-related payments, the Financial Times reported. With this channel closed, international payments for Russian oil and gas will be harder, drying up a part of the Kremlin&#x2019;s foreign currency revenue. This will cause the ruble to weaken above the psychological barrier of 100 to the U.S. dollar. Gazprombank, partially owned by Russia&apos;s state-run energy giant Gazprom, was also used to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The ruble is expected to weaken further with the beginning of the winter holiday season, as companies have to import more goods from abroad to satisfy increased consumer demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/ruble-gazprombank/	2024-11-27T00:35:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258690185.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 17 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 27. Russia attacked Ukraine with 89 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-six were shot down by air defenses while 48 were lost across Ukraine, likely thanks to electronic warfare means, the statement read. Five drones reportedly flew to Belarus, Russia, and occupied territories. Some of the drones targeted the capital city of Kyiv overnight. Two people were injured when drone debris fell on a non-residential building, the city&apos;s military administration reported. Drone debris also damaged houses and apartment buildings elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast killed two people and injured one, the regional military administration reported. The two fatalities were reported after a Russian missile struck a residential building and kindergarten in the city of Sumy. One civilian was also injured during Russian attacks against the Velyka Pysarivka community near the Russian border, officials said. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were injured in the village of Zhovte, and one in the town of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast injured 11 people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. A high-rise building, 10 houses, a gas pipeline, a car repair shop, a garage, and cars were damaged. Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, and Zhytomyr oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-107/	2024-11-27T00:07:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Lysak-Nov-27.jpg
Russia using bombers it received from Ukraine in 1999, RFE/RL reports	Russia actively uses at least six Tu-160-type bombers that Ukraine gave to Russia in 1999 as a payment of gas debt, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; investigation showed on Nov. 26. The investigation also identified pilots flying the planes and launching missile strikes against Ukraine. Russia regularly uses its strategic aviation to attack cities and infrastructure across Ukraine. Ukraine handed over Tu-160 supersonic heavy bombers in 1999 as part of a larger debt payment for Russian gas. The journalists identified the planes by comparing their old serial numbers in archives and aviation registries. RFE/RL was also able to identify some pilots flying these planes against Ukraine, like Oleg Skytskyi, a serviceman of the 22nd Aviation Division, which Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) says is &quot;responsible for numerous victims and destruction in Ukraine,&quot; one of them likely being launching a missile that killed an RFE/RL journalist in Kyiv on April 28, 2022. In the 1999 arms transfer, Kyiv transferred to Moscow eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS heavy bombers, as well as 575 Kh-55 cruise missiles, with Russia writing off $275 million in gas debt, 10% of the assets&apos; real value. The transferred Kh-55 missiles were also used against Ukraine, an earlier investigation by Radio Free showed. The Tu-160 strategic bombers are among the biggest warplanes ever operated, but they are only sparsely used due to maintenance problems. They were the latest heavy strategic bombers designed in the Soviet Union, capable of carrying conventional and nuclear weaponry. Their last use was on Nov. 17, when Russia launched one of the largest aerial strikes on Ukraine, killing seven civilians and damaging its energy grid.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ukraine-bombers-rferl/	2024-11-26T23:29:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-472748686.jpg
Biden asking US Congress for $24 billion in Ukraine aid, arms replenishment, Politico reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is quietly asking the U.S. Congress to greenlight an additional $24 billion in assistance to Ukraine and to replenish provided weapons before he leaves office, Politico Pro reported on Nov. 26, citing an obtained document. The news comes amid the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to ship in as much aid to Ukraine as possible before Donald Trump, who has criticized military support for Kyiv, takes office in January. Roughly $16 billion of the sum would be used to restock U.S. arsenals, while the remaining &#xA0;$8 billion would go to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), the outlet wrote. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program for supplying arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. Two congressional sources confirmed the information for Politico and said that Congress received the request on Nov. 25. The White House suggested that Congress could include the assistance in its effort to avert a government shut down next month, according to the document obtained by Politico. The report aligns with earlier statements from Biden&apos;s team that the White House would seek Congress&apos; approval for additional aid for Ukraine in 2025. In recent days, the Biden administration has made a series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations. These steps included approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. The request for additional funding has already received pushback from critics of Washington&apos;s pro-Ukraine policy. Republican Senator and Trump&apos;s ally Mike Lee said that &quot;Congress must not give him (Biden) a free gift to further sabotage President Trump&#x2019;s peace negotiations on the way out the door.&quot; Trump said he would seek to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. While the details of his plan remain unclear, some reports indicate it might entail Ukraine ceding territory and at least temporarily foregoing its NATO aspirations. It remains unclear whether the funding request will be successful, as Congress &#x2013; namely the Republican-led House of Representatives &#x2013; stalled an earlier $61 billion assistance bill for months before finally approving it in April. The November elections reinforced Republican control over the legislature, as the party also secured the majority in the Senate. The new Congress will be sworn in in early January.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-24-billion-politico/	2024-11-26T22:47:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 735,410 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 735,410 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 27. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,449 tanks, 19,304 armored fighting vehicles, 30,126 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,830 artillery systems, 1,255 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,005 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,616 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-735-410-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-26T22:27:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258947571.jpg
Umerov-led delegation arrives in South Korea seeking weapons, military aid, media reports	A Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov arrived in South Korea on Nov. 27, with the aim of requesting military aid from Seoul, several media outlets reported. The delegation is expected to meet with President Yoon Suk Yeol as early as Wednesday, according to the Korean Times, citing several sources close to the matter. Yoon has previously said that the country does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine in the light of deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian-North Korean relations entered a new level when Pyongyang dispatched around 11,000 troops to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. A vast majority of the deployed North Korean troops are currently receiving training alongside Russian forces, preparing to attempt to regain control of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ahead of the planned meeting, the delegation has reportedly met with South Korean National Security Adviser and former Defense Minister Shin Won-sik, according to the South Korean media outlet Dong-a Ilbo. South Korea&apos;s government has not yet confirmed the arrival of the Ukrainian delegation. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine would provide South Korea with a detailed request for military support in an October interview with KBS. South Korea has thus far resisted supplying lethal arms to Ukraine and instead opted to provide financial, and humanitarian support alongside non-lethal aid, citing legislative restrictions. Some media reports from last year claimed that the country secretly supplied artillery shells to Ukraine via the U.S., though the South Korean government denied the reports. Living in constant tension with its North Korean neighbors, South Korea boasts a powerful military and strong defense industry, making the country a major arms exporter. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-led-delegation-arrives-in-seoul-to-request-weapons-military-aid-media-reports/	2024-11-26T21:54:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/korea.jpeg
NATO-Ukraine Council convenes following Russia's use of Oreshnik missile	The NATO-Ukraine Council convened at a meeting on Nov. 26 in response to Russia&apos;s use of the new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; the NATO alliance said in a news release. According to the release, senior Ukrainian military officials briefed members of the council via a video link. The meeting was held at NATO headquarters in Brussels at the ambassadorial level. Russia first launched the weapon in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon.&quot; Zelensky contradicted Putin&apos;s claim on Nov. 24, saying experts were currently analyzing the wreckage of the missile and working with allies to put together a suitable response. &quot;Deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO Spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said earlier in a statement by the alliance, referring to the use of IRBMs. NATO added in its statement that Russia&#x2019;s use of the Oreshnik missile is an attempt to terrorize the civilian population of Ukraine and scare those who support Ukraine in its defense against Russia&apos;s &quot;illegal and unprovoked aggression.&quot; During the discussions, Ukraine further emphasized the need for support from NATO allies to strengthen its air defense against such future attacks. Russia has continued to attack Ukrainian targets ahead of an expected harsh winter amid Russia strike on energy infrastructure. Overnight on Nov. 25, Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly being able to down 76 drones across 17 oblasts. On Nov. 25, delegates from NATO member states&#x2019; legislatures voiced their support for Ukraine becoming the 33rd member of the alliance in a resolution adopted by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Independent from NATO, the assembly has no direct role in overseeing NATO policies.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-ukraine-council-convenes-following-russias-use-of-oreshnik-missile/	2024-11-26T20:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995421.jpg
Turkey in talks with US over sanctions exemption for Russian natural gas payments	Turkey is in talks with the United States in an effort to receive a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said on Nov. 25. The United States introduced new sanctions on Nov. 21, targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials. Bayraktar said that the country is seeking a sanctions exemption for Gazprombank, which Ankara uses to pay Moscow to secure Turkish energy supplies. Presently, Russia stands as Turkey&apos;s primary provider of natural gas, supplying over 40% of its consumption last year. &quot;These sanctions will affect Turkey. We cannot pay, if we cannot pay we cannot buy the goods. The foreign ministry is in talks,&quot; Bayraktar told reporters. The U.S. had previously refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments. Despite the past restraint, the U.S. Treasury Department said that the most recent sanctions &quot;will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The Financial Times noted in its reporting that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. &quot;If such an exemption is not granted to Turkey it will directly impact us. At this point Russia is not the target, Turkey is the direct target,&quot; Bayraktar added. The new U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. Turkey began discussions on the sanctions exemption with the United States when it was notified of the incoming sanctions. Both countries are still discussing a possible waiver. Bayraktar previously told the Financial Times in April the country was in talks with U.S.-based ExxonMobil to secure a long-term liquified natural gas (LNG) deal worth billions of dollars, aiming to reduce reliance on Russian natural gas. On Nov. 26, &#xA0;a source familiar with the plans told Reuters, that Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled gas company, is planning for a scenario in which no natural gas will flow to Europe through Ukraine after Dec. 31, 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-in-talks-with-us-over-sanctions-exemption-for-russian-natural-gas-payments/	2024-11-26T20:06:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1246203218.jpg
Ukraine not opposed to exhumation of Volyn massacre victims on its territory, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement with Poland on Nov. 26 that there were &quot;no obstacles&quot; for Poland to conduct exhumation work on the victims of the Volyn massacre of World War II, amid previous tension over with matter with Warsaw. &quot;Each family has the right to honor the memory of their ancestors with dignity,&quot; Ukrainian &#xA0;Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement. &quot;We are working on practical mechanisms to resolve matters related to searches and exhumations. The joint release issued by both countries foreign ministries, which comes as Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha makes his first trip to Poland since being appointed to the post, does not explicitly mention the Volyn massacre but instead refers to &quot;historical&quot; misunderstandings between the two countries. The Volyn massacres took place in 1943 during World War II on the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliation. The Volyn massacres are a contentious topic between Ukraine and Poland and have often led to soured diplomatic relations. During a Sept. 13 meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Sikorski demanded Ukraine finally allow the exhumation of the victims of the Volyn massacre and warned against expecting a quick EU accession, sparking frustration from Zelensky, according to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s sources familiar with the matter. Ukraine&apos;s president reportedly accused Warsaw of politicizing historical events, falling short on promised military aid, and not fully backing Ukraine&apos;s path to EU membership. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz also said in July that Ukraine will not join the EU without resolving the historical issue of the mass killings of Poles in Volyn. The Defense Minister&apos;s comments saw a mixed reaction from other officials in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda saying that threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy. The joint release, which sought to ease tensions over the issue, indicated that both foreign ministries would oversee a joint Ukrainian-Polish working group to carry out the exhumation of the victims. In a statement following the joint release, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the agreement is &quot;key to the full reconciliation between our nations, so necessary at this dramatic moment in our shared history.&quot; In early October, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance&apos;s announced that it plans to search for the remains of victims of the Volyn massacre, which the Polish Foreign Ministry called a &quot;step in the right direction.&quot; Despite historical grievances, Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-opposed-to-the-exhumation-of-volyn-massacre-victims-on-its-territory-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-11-26T18:55:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-452718472.jpg
Russian attack on residential building, kindergarten in Sumy kills 2	A Russian missile attack on Nov. 26 struck a residential building and kindergarten in the city of Sumy, leaving at least two people dead, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. The Russian missile, which was reportedly launched at a vehicle service station, also struck a nearby multi-story residential building and caused damage inside a nearby kindergarten, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. One more person may still be trapped under the ruble at the site of the attack as emergency services continue their work. The attack on the city also damaged 13 cars, Suspilne reported. The attack on the regional capital comes as Russia shelled Sumy Oblast 120 times on Nov. 26 in 21 attacks on the region, according to the regional military administration. An explosive dropped from a Russian drone also injured one person in the town of Velyka Pysarivka. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. A Russian missile strike on a residential building in Sumy on Nov. 17 killed 11 people and injured another 89. A source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said on Nov. 23 that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there &#x2014; as Ukraine looked to do with its surprise incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in August. Russia continues its onslaught of drone and missile attacks ahead of an expected harsh winter amid Russia strike on energy infrastructure. Overnight on Nov. 25, Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly being able to down 76 drones across 17 oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-residential-building-kindergarten-in-sumy-kills-2/	2024-11-26T17:55:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2186977891-612x612.jpg
Biden shifts policies to strengthen Ukraine ahead of potential peace talks, WP reports	U.S. President Joe Biden has reversed key policies on providing advanced weapons to Ukraine, including longer-range missiles and antipersonnel land mines, as Kyiv faces mounting pressure on the battlefield and a potential need to negotiate with Russia. Many U.S. officials now acknowledge that Ukraine could be pushed into talks within months and might be forced to cede territory to end the war, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Nov. 26. In mid-November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, a decision aiming at strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position. His administration previously resisted supplying such weapons over concerns of escalating tensions with Russia. The changes come amid significant challenges for Ukraine, including battlefield losses, reports of North Korea sending troops to support Russia, and Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within 24 hours, but officials worry his administration would cut off aid to Ukraine, undermining its ability to resist Russian aggression. Biden&#x2019;s aides argue that evolving conditions on the ground have driven his decisions to provide weapons, but critics, including former U.S. ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker, say the delays emboldened Moscow. &quot;It gives Russia a sense of impunity,&quot; Volker told the WP, adding that earlier support could have bolstered Ukraine&#x2019;s position. &quot;They know they have a sanctuary. They know we don&#x2019;t want to escalate, and they can go ahead and carry out the war, conduct strikes and do outrageous things.&quot; European allies, while welcoming the recent weapons transfers, have expressed frustration that the assistance did not come earlier when Ukraine&#x2019;s position was stronger. Many now believe that peace talks may involve territorial concessions, and discussions have begun on potential security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression, according to the WP. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged NATO allies to increase support for Ukraine ahead of Trump&#x2019;s return to office, emphasizing the need to reinforce Kyiv before the U.S. political landscape shifts further. &quot;We will continue to shore up everything we&#x2019;re doing for Ukraine to ensure it can effectively defend itself,&quot; Blinken said during his one-day emergency visit to Brussels on Nov. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-shifts-policies-to-strengthen-ukraine-ahead-of-potential-peace-talks-wp-reports/	2024-11-26T16:39:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1903200714.jpg
Gazprom plans for end of gas transit via Ukraine after 2024, Reuters reports	Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled gas company, is planning for a scenario in which no natural gas will flow to Europe through Ukraine after Dec. 31, 2024, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. Kyiv has indicated it will not extend the transit deal, ending over 50 years of gas flows from Siberia to central Europe &#x2014; a vital revenue stream for Russia since the Soviet era. Ukraine earns up to $1 billion annually in transit fees but has said it does not intend to renew the agreement. Moscow, however, has expressed willingness to continue using the Ukrainian route. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow remains ready to pump gas through Ukraine. Despite these signals, Gazprom&#x2019;s internal planning assumes no Ukrainian transit next year, the source said, adding that the company expects Russian gas exports to Europe and Turkey&#x2014;termed &quot;far abroad&quot;&#x2014;to decline by 20% in 2025. Due to the loss of the Ukrainian route, exports are projected to drop to just under 39 billion cubic meters (bcm) from the more than 49 bcm expected this year. The expected drop excludes gas supplies to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, which is forecast to reach 38 bcm in 2025. Turkish supplies via the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines are not expected to decline. Russia&#x2019;s gas exports to Europe via Ukraine have already fallen significantly, with only 15 bcm delivered through this route in 2023. That figure represents just 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe in 2018-2019. The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline transported about 14.65 bcm of gas through the Sudzha entry point in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to Slovakia in 2023, accounting for roughly half of Russia&#x2019;s remaining European gas exports. The war in Ukraine and the 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany have severely disrupted the energy link between Russia and Europe. EU gas consumption fell to 295 bcm in 2023, with Europe increasingly reliant on U.S. liquefied natural gas supplies to meet demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/gazprom-plans-for-end-of-gas-transit-via-ukraine-after-2024-reuters-reports/	2024-11-26T14:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-467548811.jpg
US Air Force notes drone activity over military bases in UK, Reuters reports	Unidentified drones have flown over three U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K. in the past week, U.S. officials said on Nov. 26. &quot;Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell from Nov. 20 to Nov. 26,&quot; a spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. The three bases, located in Suffolk and Norfolk, are leased by the U.S. Air Force from the U.K. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder addressed the incidents, emphasizing the U.S. military&#x2019;s serious approach to the situation. &quot;Installation leaders have determined so far that none of these incursions impact the base residents, the facilities, or the assets that we have on those bases,&quot; Ryder said. While noting that small drones are a common occurrence, he stressed it remains too early to determine whether the flights originated from hobbyists or another source. A U.S. official, speaking anonymously, indicated the drone activity appeared coordinated rather than the work of casual enthusiasts. The official added that investigations into the incidents are ongoing. The U.K.&apos;s Ministry of Defense acknowledged the reports and expressed its commitment to security at defense installations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-air-force-notes-drone-activity-over-military-bases-in-uk-reuters-reports/	2024-11-26T13:56:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launches record 188 drones against Ukraine overnight, Air Force says	Key developments on Nov. 26: Russia launched a record number of 188 Shaheds and other drones against Ukraine in a single night on Nov. 26, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 76 drones across 17 oblasts, while 95 were &quot;lost,&quot; presumably thanks to electronic warfare means. Five drones flew to Belarus, according to the Air Force. Russia has deployed cheap kamikaze drones, including Iranian-made Shaheds, against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since the first year of the full-scale war. Moscow has intensified the drone attacks in recent months, with air raid alerts sounding daily in major cities like Kyiv. &quot;During the overnight attack, Russia launched a record number of Shahed-type attack drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles of an unknown type from the directions of Orel, Bryans, Kursk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia,&quot; the Air Force&apos;s statement read. Moscow launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine in October, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry admitted on Nov. 26 that Ukraine had targeted Russian S-400 air defense systems and an airfield in embattled Kursk Oblast with U.S.-made long-range ATACMS missiles over the past three days. The statement is the first public confirmation of the attacks by Russia, following multiple reports of strikes after Washington permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to the ministry, Ukrainian forces launched five ATACMS missiles on Nov. 23 near the village of Lotarevka, some 37 km northwest of Kursk, with three of them shot down. The other two missiles hit the positions of an S-400 surface-to-air missile division. &quot;The strike damaged a radar. There are casualties among the personnel,&quot; the Defense Ministry said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also claimed that Ukraine had struck a Russian S-400 radar in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine also fired eight ATACMS missiles on Nov. 25 at the Kursk Vostochny airbase in the town of Khalino in Kursk Oblast, seven of which were allegedly shot down by Russian air defenses, the Russian ministry claimed. One of the missiles &quot;reached its target,&quot; injuring two soldiers and damaging infrastructure, the ministry said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. While OSINT analysts earlier reported the strike against the Russian airbase, the Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry threatened with &quot;retaliatory actions&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s strikes. The advance of Russian forces in Ukraine continues to gain pace, reaching a new weekly and monthly record, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Nov. 25, citing its analysis of the DeepState monitoring group&apos;s data. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the analysis. Russian forces have taken 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) since the start of November, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Agentstvo wrote. The advance is reportedly the fastest near Velyka Novosilka, a village in southern Donetsk Oblast close to the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. According to Agentstvo&apos;s analysis of DeepState data, Russia captured around 187 square kilometers (72 square miles) in the south. Moscow&apos;s troops have also reportedly advanced 33 square kilometers (12.7 square miles) near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, 10 square kilometers (3.8 square miles) in the east of Kharkiv Oblast, and 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) near Chasiv Yar. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Russian forces apparently shot five unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 26, launching a war crime investigation. According to the statement, Russian troops captured five Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector. After forcing them to lay down their weapons and lie down on the ground, they are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. &quot;An investigation is currently underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime and the persons involved,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he had notified the United Nations and the Red Cross regarding the latest case from the Pokrovsk sector. &quot;I emphasize that the killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is qualified as a serious international crime,&quot; he wrote. The U.K. has delivered dozens of Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports, marking the first major arms transfer under Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s leadership. The unannounced shipments carried out weeks ago, were ordered after Ukrainian forces faced shortages of long-range missiles, according to sources familiar with the matter. Officials speaking to Bloomberg, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information, confirmed that the missiles were supplied before the U.K. and the U.S. authorized Ukraine to target locations inside Russia with long-range weapons. The exact timeline and quantity of the shipment remain undisclosed. &quot;We do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit [Russian President Vladimir Putin],&quot; the Ministry of Defense told Bloomberg. The ministry reiterated the U.K.&#x2019;s &quot;ironclad&quot; support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian forces recently used the Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets in the western Bryansk region, one day after deploying U.S.-made ATACMS in similar operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-44/	2024-11-26T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
Once liberated Kupiansk braces for worst as Russian troops approach, and future Western support looks uncertain	KUPIANSK &#x2014; Volodymyr paused his Sunday stroll from a shopping center in Kupiansk to take pictures of rubble from a Russian strike that almost killed his wife late last month. &quot;It was broad daylight when they struck,&quot; he said. &quot;Our only luck was that my wife was in the kitchen, so the flying glass did not hit her,&quot; Volodymyr said, who lives with his wife only a few meters from the epicenter of the explosion. Fearing a return of Russian occupation to his increasingly bombed-out front-line city in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, Volodymyr refused to provide his full name. The 1.5-ton thermobaric bomb that Russian troops dropped next to the shopping center at the edge of the city killed a 73-year-old woman and injured others. The use of such destructive weapons against civilians marks the Russian army&apos;s upscaled push to occupy the latest Ukrainian city, enduring more suffering and uncertain prospects. One recent Russian strike on Kupiansk disrupted central water supplies throughout the city, forcing the people left in the city, most of them retirees, to roam streets carrying buckets from wells to their homes. &quot;There has been no water for two days now, and we&apos;re afraid that soon there will be no electricity and (natural) gas,&quot; said Ivana in early November, a retiree who glanced into the sky nervously, fearing the possibility of Russian drone strikes from above. &quot;We feel abandoned,&quot; she added as Russia&apos;s army sped up a grinding advance towards Kupiansk.

(Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. The pressure on the city remains, with Russian troops geared up to try again in the near future. Divided by the Oskil River, Kupiansk lies at a critical junction between the Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast and the adjacent Kharkiv Oblast, which Ukraine largely liberated during a surprise counteroffensive in autumn 2022. Now, with Russia&apos;s increasing offensives across the entire front and the U.S. support for Ukraine in the long run remaining uncertain, residents of Kupiansk are expecting the worst to come. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had promised to end Russia&apos;s war swiftly, without providing a clear scenario on how he plans to achieve such a result. The president-elect&apos;s inner circle has also been vocal, floating the idea of freezing the war along the current front lines leaving cities like Kupiansk and the residents that remain on the edge or in Russia grip indefinitely. Russia has a poor record of keeping to ceasefire agreements that predate its full-blown invasion of Ukraine by almost a decade. &quot;We already went through this during the first and second Minsk agreements, through various truces, freezes, but in all cases, Russia always violated these agreements,&quot; Serhiy Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent. His comments refer to two ceasefire agreements, one in 2014 and another in 2015 brokered by the West, that froze front lines in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts after Russia occupied part of those regions. A number of towns and villages were left on the front lines, experiencing occasional shelling, lack of basic necessities, and lacking the ability to escape the years-long war. A visit to Kupiansk today largely mirrors the devastation brought to the towns left on the front lines. Kupiansk is an increasingly abandoned city. Despite a mandatory evacuation order for all citizens announced in mid-October, locals estimate several thousand residents remain despite the mounting risks. The city is experiencing the third siege in three years after it was briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2022, then liberated during the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of the same year. Back then, the Ukrainian army&apos;s surprise counterattack pushed the Russian troops to about a dozen kilometers from the city&apos;s outskirts. Two years after the retreat, Russia&apos;s army has doubled its efforts to recapture it. Since early September, they have advanced several kilometers, approaching the city&apos;s eastern outskirts. Earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s army said it was repelling enemy attempts to enter the city. Kuzan, a native of Kharkiv Oblast, said Ukraine&apos;s army is in a good position to hold the city&apos;s eastern outskirts against Russian incursions &quot;provided that there is a sufficient amount of ammunition and materiel.&quot; However, that remains in doubt as President-elect Trump vows to end the war quickly, pulling the plug on future military aid to Ukraine. One of the possible scenarios to follow up on Trump&apos;s promise is reducing military aid to Ukraine, forcing the country into giving up territory for peace. Yet Trump, who has in the past expressed a fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also said he could boost Ukrainian weapons supplies to pressure Russia into a peace agreement. &quot;I believe that what he (Trump) has said about the tools is what he intends to do,&quot; former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told the Kyiv Independent. People from Kupiansk arrive at an evacuation point as mandatory evacuation from four communities in the Kharkiv Oblast kicks off due to hostilities in the region on Oct. 17, 2024. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;It&apos;s not clear (how Trump would achieve peace). I do think that there is going to be some form of cut in aid. It may also be that American military assistance will move from a straight aid program to a loan program,&quot; said Herbst, now serving as senior director of the Washington, D.C.-based Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center. The former ambassador is skeptical about a lasting agreement between Ukraine and Russia should the front line be frozen. &quot;It would not surprise me if Putin were to agree to negotiate along those lines, maybe even reach an agreement. And then, of course, work immediately to undermine that agreement and continue his aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Herbst added. In Kupiansk, the last bridge connecting the two sides of the Oskil River remained open to civilian traffic in late October. &quot;The Russians are striking the industrial complex on the left not only with glide bombs and FPV drones now, but with artillery and tanks too,&quot; a soldier on the ground with the military, call sign Riaba, told the Kyiv Independent. He spoke amid the relentless sound of various calibers crackling and booming in the background without revealing his real name due to security concerns. &quot;The Russians are attempting to break into the (eastern) part of the city in small units, but so far we repelled them,&quot; he said. &quot;They need it because of the railway, if they take it, we&apos;ll be in a very, very bad position.&quot; Kuzan estimates that Kupiansk holds value to the Russian army due to its highways and railway lines. If captured, it could serve as a springboard for continued north-to-south offensive operations into the heart of the last remaining densely populated urban areas of Donetsk Oblast still held by Ukraine &#x2014; the cities and agglomerations of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. &quot;The city is a large railway hub, and the Russian army&apos;s logistics is built around railway transportation, not road,&quot; Kuzan said. Although the Russian military has not yet been able to get a foothold, the city remains under indiscriminate bombardment. &quot;The Russians are on the attack, they are not trying to freeze the front line,&quot; Kuzan added. If Russian forces capture Kupiansk before a ceasefire, they will be in pole position to retake all eastern bank territory south of the city along the Oskil River stretching south to the Donetsk Oblast front lines. In the unlikely event of a frozen front line, Kuzan sees little chance for Kupiansk to live in peace due to the constant threat of Russian attacks after a ceasefire. &quot;Both for Kupiansk and our other cities to be able to live and function, it is necessary, first of all, to quickly reduce the strike capabilities of the Russian army,&quot; said Kuzan. A view of the enterence to Kupiansk, Ukraine on Oct. 16, 2024. (Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images)His comments echo President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s repeated calls for allies to boost firepower supplies, including the provision of more long-range missiles capable of hindering Russian logistics. &quot;Only in this case can we talk about some kind of stabilization in these cities, having removed their instrument for terror,&quot; Kuzan said. Back in Kupiansk, the scene in early November was nerve-racking. &quot;We trust God will help us,&quot; said Svitlana, a resident selling military chevrons in the middle of the city, despite the sound of small arms fire in the background. Some people motivated to help feed Ukrainian soldiers protecting the city remained reluctant to evacuate. &quot;Other than the fact that we were born here, who would sell these boys (the soldiers) hotdogs if we fled?&quot; asked Viktoria, a shopkeeper at the bombed-out shopping center that nearly killed Volodymyr&apos;s wife. As her colleague repaired a damaged roof, Viktoria served customers. &quot;We remained open that day and will be open for the guys (Ukrainian soldiers) in the future,&quot; she added.

Norway may increase aid to Ukraine to $2.7 billion in 2025	Oslo may increase its support for Ukraine to 30 billion kroner ($2.7 billion) in 2025, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Nov. 26, NRK public broadcaster reported. Norway has allocated 27 billion kroner ($2.4 billion) to support Ukraine this year, but in the draft state budget for 2025, the funding was reduced to 15 billion kroner ($1.3 billion). After the Norwegian government met with leaders of the country&apos;s parliament earlier in the day, Store said there is a proposal to double funding to at least 30 billion. The final decision is expected to be made on Nov. 28. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.8 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker. In late October, Store said that Oslo would provide Kyiv with a new 500-million-euro ($543 million) aid package, with over half allocated for military assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-may-increase-aid-to-ukraine-to-2-7-billion-in-2025/	2024-11-26T12:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1636214818.jpg
Honestly, go f**k yourself' — Ukrainians react to Joe Rogan’s rant on Ukraine	Joe Rogan, one of the world&apos;s most popular podcasters, has sparked outrage in Ukraine, after claiming that Kyiv and its Western allies, rather than Russia, &quot;are about to start World War III.&quot; In an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience last Friday, the U.S. host criticized the outgoing President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration for allowing Ukraine to strike with Storm Shadow and ATACMS long-range missiles deep into Russian territory. In response to their use, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a &quot;test&quot; of a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, carried out in a strike on the city of Dnipro, central Ukraine on Nov. 21. Despite the long-running nuclear rhetoric emanating from the Kremlin, and the fact Moscow launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the first place, Rogan pinned all the blame for the escalation of international tensions on Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;How are you allowed to (authorize strikes inside Russia) when you are on your way out? Like, people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore,&quot; Rogan said. &#x201C;There should be some sort of pause for significant actions that could potentially start World War III.&#x201D; &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said, adding that negotiations with Moscow should be the path Kyiv pursues over military action. Rogan also repeated unfounded stories that Zelensky uses drugs. &quot;This is cocaine-like behavior. &#x2018;Putin&#x2019;s f**king &#xA0;scared, man, Putin&#x2019;s terrified. We got him. We got him, man, we got him.&#x2019; &quot;Like, what are you talking about? He has nuclear missiles. You f**king monkeys,&quot; Rogan said. Prominent Ukrainians including former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko, and former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba have publicly condemned Rogan&apos;s statements. On Nov. 26, the Kyiv Independent went out on the streets of Kyiv to see what people thought about them. Natalia Romanets, purchasing manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Let him come to Kyiv, let him come to Ukraine, see everything with his own eyes, and then make some conclusions. Because it&apos;s hard to assess the situation from so many thousands of kilometers away. I think he just doesn&apos;t feel or understand what is happening in the world. It&apos;s strange. I thought Americans were polite, well-mannered people but what he is saying about us is simply offensive. If he were attacked somewhere in America, at a gas station, for example, and they put a knife to his throat, how would he negotiate? Maybe he knows some formula or scenarios for negotiating in such circumstances with a knife pressing on an artery. It&#x2019;s hard to talk when you&apos;re being killed. Albina Volobuueva, sales worker in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)(Rogan) does not live in Ukraine, so he cannot comment on it. He has nothing to do with us. This war already feels like World War III to me &#x2014; many countries are already involved, they help us in various ways, and they also suffer because of it. So, to me, World War III has already begun &#x2014; and has been going for quite some time now. I would be glad if this were over because I can&apos;t handle the constant deaths, explosions, people being taken away, and men going to war anymore. Life in the country is really tense right now. But if there were negotiations, they should be for the benefit of our country and our people. This person&apos;s words are very strange and incorrect. Yelyzaveta Kovalenko, social media manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)We are now simply hostages of Russia, which has come to our land. We didn&apos;t call them, we didn&apos;t start this war, and we didn&apos;t want it. We were living peaceful lives in Ukraine, and they just invaded us. We have nothing else left to defend ourselves with. Putin will never be satisfied. Therefore, negotiations should only end with the recognition that we are a sovereign entity that no one else should touch. (Rogan) has never been in a state of war for three years, like our president. Considering how tired he already is, how he has no strength left, one could think all kinds of things about him. But our president still addresses the Ukrainian people daily and supports us by doing that. I would say this podcaster transfers the responsibility of the Russians onto us. But that&#x2019;s not right. We did not start the war. The responsibility is absolutely on them (Russians) for the possible start of World War III. We are being killed, and we have nothing left to do, only fight. Who even said that Russia wants negotiations? Oksana Hres, sales worker in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Stop Putin, and then there will be no World War III. Tell the mothers, children, and wives of tortured people about negotiations, about how you can somehow reach an agreement when you can&apos;t return the children who were tortured to death. As for his last words about World War III, I think he should remember the words of (Ukraine&apos;s former Commander-in-Chief Valerii) Zaluzhnyi about the fact that World War III has already begun, and so it makes sense to figure out what side he wants to be on. To start negotiations, both sides need to want to do it. Unfortunately, no one is willing to make concessions right now. Olha Serova, fashion industry manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)If I were to comment on this situation, I&apos;d probably say &#x201C;f*ck you.&#x201D; What else can I say? I think that advising to enter negotiations means he&apos;s only superficially observing the situation. Because if a person delves deeper into it, he will understand that negotiating with (Putin) is impossible. The fact that Russia launches a bunch of missiles at Ukraine &#x2013; is that normal? Should we feel safe? We did not start this war. And in fact, the greater responsibility lies with Russia, with Putin, for starting World War III. Mykola Korotkyi, video producer in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Honestly, go f**k yourself. Come here, live here, and truly understand what&#x2019;s happening instead of making assumptions with your headlines. We would then look at you as if you were actually experiencing what&#x2019;s happening in Ukraine every night. I&apos;m not just talking about Kyiv, but places where glide bombs and other (weapons) are dropped. That&apos;s why someone like you, such a d*ckhead, shouldn&#x2019;t open your mouth. If the U.S. had fulfilled their international agreements on time, supported Ukraine, and taken a proper stance on what was happening, there would be no World War III.	https://kyivindependent.com/honestly-go-f-k-yourself-ukrainians-react-to-joe-rogans-rant-on-ukraine/	2024-11-26T12:28:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1390671342.jpg
Ukrainian MP from Zelensky's party nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize	Oleksandr Merezhko, a top MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party, has nominated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, according to his letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee seen by the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 26. Merezhko&apos;s move is at odds with the statements of many opinion leaders in Ukraine who have criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioning further U.S. assistance to Ukraine. Trump has also promised to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, and there is speculation that he could pressure Kyiv to cede territory to Russia or agree to Putin&apos;s terms. However, some Ukrainian politicians and analysts argue that Trump may be swayed to Ukraine&apos;s side and help Kyiv reach a peace deal with Russia from a position of strength. &quot;It is my belief that Trump has made considerable contributions to world peace, and that he can make more in the future,&quot; Merezhko, an MP from Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party and chairman of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, wrote in his letter. The lawmaker mentioned Trump&apos;s mediation of agreements between Israel and Muslim countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan, during his first presidential term. &quot;Trump also laid the foundations for today&apos;s international coalition of support for Ukraine by demonstrating global leadership in supplying weapons to resist Russia&apos;s brutal and illegal war of aggression,&quot; Merezhko said in an apparent reference to Trump&apos;s decision to supply Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles during his first term. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about his motivation for the nomination, the lawmaker said he wants to use it &quot;as an opportunity to attract Trump&apos;s attention so that he could help Ukraine to survive.&quot; Merezhko expressed hope that &quot;in his attempts to stop Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine (Trump) will be searching for a solution on the basis of international law, including such principles as territorial integrity, respect for the sovereignty of Ukraine, and non-use of force.&quot; Merezhko said in his nomination letter that Trump could help Ukraine achieve &quot;just, comprehensive and sustainable peace based on the UN Charter and principles of international law.&quot; On the campaign trail, Trump promised to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine if elected, saying in September that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s war effort at a critical time, as Russian forces make their fastest gains in months and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-mp-proposes-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize/	2024-11-26T11:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887240.jpg
Ukraine pushes back Russian troops from Kupiansk, military says	Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops from Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast and maintain control over the situation on the town&#x2019;s outskirts, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, said on Nov. 26. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&#x2019;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. Speaking on national television, Voloshyn said that Russia uses small groups in an attempt to cross to the right bank of the Oskil River. &quot;Even if groups of eight to ten people manage to cross, only two or three from each group reach the (right) bank. The enemy has been eliminated there as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything there (in Kupiansk) is under the control of our Defense Forces.&quot; The estimated advance of Russian forces in Kharkiv Oblast as of Nov. 25, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-push-back-russian-troops-from-kupiansk-military-says/	2024-11-26T10:19:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114402-1.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 2	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 2 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Nov. 18-24, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament adopts the 2025 state budget. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, on Nov. 19 adopted next year&#x2019;s state budget in its final reading. The government expects budget revenues to reach Hr 2.3 trillion (around $55 billion) the following year. This includes an estimated Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) in additional revenue from tax hikes. However, President Volodymyr Zelensky has yet to sign the draft law with relevant amendments to the Tax Code. Budget expenditures are projected to reach a record Hr 3.94 trillion ($95 billion), with Hr 2.22 trillion ($53 billion) allocated to defense spending. Government approves two draft laws to meet IMF structural benchmarks. On Nov. 22, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a draft law to establish a High Specialized Administrative Court with judges selected based on professional competence and integrity, by a selection commission with a decisive vote of experts with international experience. The deadline to meet this obligation is set for Dec. 31. The government has already submitted its draft law (#12206-1) to the Verkhovna Rada as legislation on the same topic was submitted by Andrii Motovylovets, the deputy chair of parliament&#x2019;s Sluha Narodu (Servant of the People) faction. The move of Motovylovets triggered a 14-day countdown for registering alternative draft laws, which will end on Nov. 28. Additionally, the Cabinet of Ministers approved amendments to the Budget Code to incorporate public investment management (PIM) into the budgeting process as outlined in the June 2024 PIM Action Plan. This proposed legislation has not yet been submitted to parliament. This structural benchmark has to be met by the &#xA0;end of January 2025. Verkhovna Rada unblocks reform of Accounting Chamber. Following the adoption of draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber (ACU), Ukraine&apos;s main auditing body, lawmakers submitted seven resolutions aimed at overturning the decision. They were all rejected last week, paving the way for the parliament chairman and the president to sign the bill into law. The law will establish a transparent, competitive process for selecting the ACU&#x2019;s members, with international experts having a decisive vote of approval. This will ensure the political and financial independence of the state body. Verkhovna Rada votes for draft law to meet an obligation under Ukraine Plan. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament adopted in the first of two readings draft law #12131 on resuming monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the first quarter 2025. The Ukraine Plan sets a deadline for this measure in the second quarter of 2025. Illegal tobacco trade on the rise, according to Parliamentary Temporary Investigative Commission on Economic Security. After a period of rising, legal sales of tobacco products have begun to drop again since September 2024. Legal sales decreased to Hr 10.8 billion($260 million) in October 2024 from Hr 11.4 billion ($275 million) in August. The Parliamentary Temporary Investigative Commission on Economic Security warns that this may signal the resurgence of illegal tobacco production, with manufacturers continuing their operations despite previous searches and arrests by the Bureau of Economic Security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-2/	2024-11-26T10:13:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Despite popular uprising, Kremlin's grip on occupied Abkhazia runs supreme	When local council members gathered in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia last week to discuss new measures promoting Russian investment, a group of protestors rose to meet them. The proposed legislation, which would have legalized Russian investment and land ownership in the occupied region, had already sparked unrest. On Nov. 19, protesters blocked bridges around the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi. By Nov. 22, the crowd had descended on Abkhazia&apos;s parliament building. Protesters smashed through the gates with a truck and stormed the compound as police officers fired tear gas. At least 14 people were injured. The region&apos;s de facto president, Aslan Bzhania, resigned days later. The investment bill was shelved. This episode of seeming defiance may have sparked unease in the Kremlin. Moscow has been funding the Abkhazian government since the Russo-Georgian war in 2008, when it rolled troops into the region and declared Abkhazia and the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia to be independent states.

The same demonstrators protesting against pro-Russia legislation were also those that hoisted the Russian tricolor as they stormed Abkhazian government buildings. The pro-Russian protesters effectively ousting a pro-Russian president in protest of the adoption of a Russian-friendly piece of legislation shows how the Kremlin can endure political turmoil in the region. Many of Russia&apos;s goals in Abkhazia are firmly geopolitical. Although small &#x2014; slightly over 8,600 square kilometers &#x2014; a Russian-controlled Abkhazia can be used to reinforce Moscow&apos;s influence in the South Caucasus and to pressure Russia&apos;s southern neighbor, Georgia. Russian troops are deployed in the region, which acts as a key transport corridor between the North and South Caucasus., Iits position on the Black Sea is already being used by Moscow to build a permanent Russian naval base. For most Abkhazians, meanwhile, Moscow&apos;s presence in the area has a far more tangible day-to-day impact. Russia supports the region financially, provides Abkhazians with passports to travel abroad, and provides quotas for Abkhazian students to study at Russian universities. All of this creates broad, pro-Russian public support. &quot;Abkhazians see Russia as a guarantor of their independence,&quot; says Dr Piotr Sieniawski, an assistant professor at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy&#x144;ski University in Warsaw. &quot;Abkhazia is very much dependent on Russia: somewhere between 50 and 60% of the region&apos;s budget is made up of direct subsidies from Moscow. Without Russia, it would be very difficult for Abkhazia to survive (as a breakaway state).&quot; Such support comes with demands &#x2014; a fact of which Abkhazia&apos;s elites are particularly aware, says Sieniawski. But far more than being pro-Russian, local communities are pro-Abkhazian. They are aware of their own interests &#x2013; and tensions are quick to rise if Russia&apos;s demands are seen to collide with Abkhaz needs. That includes any law that would allow Russians to buy tracts of land along Abkhazia&apos;s tourist-friendly Black Sea coast, says Olesya Vartanyan, a conflict analyst specializing in security, peace processes, and foreign policy in the South Caucasus. Currently, only Abkhazians are allowed to own land in the breakaway region.

Bush denounced Russian recognition of Georgia&apos;s regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, warning Moscow it must &quot;reconsider this irresponsible decision.&quot; (STR/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The protests aren&apos;t about, &apos;we want Russia out.&apos; It&apos;s more about, &apos;we want to protect our own interests,&apos;&quot; Vartanyan says. &quot;They are very much afraid that if Russian companies start purchasing property, then there will be very little space left for local people. The phrase that is usually used is: &apos;We will become servants to the Russians, rather than their hosts.&apos;&quot; In many cases, such fears could be easily pushed aside by politicians, who may be inclined to wave through Russian-friendly legislation and benefit financially from a more developed tourism economy. But Abkhazia&apos;s unique history and geographical position makemakes it difficult for officials to simply discard public opinion. Its small population means that ordinary people are not only more likely to have access to politicians, but they are also very likely to have worked alongside them, attended school with them, or even be related to them. In a province of just 244,000 people where informal connections often outweigh official communication channels, there is little escape from an angry populace. &quot;Everybody knows everyone in Abkhazia. If an ordinary person meets an Abkhazian politician somewhere in Sukhumi, they feel they have the right to express their opinions openly &#x2014; and that the politician should be listening,&quot; says Sieniawski. Another well-used Russian anti-protest tactic &#x2014; simple police violence &#x2014; is unlikely to quell demonstrations in the region. Most local families did not surrender their weapons after the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict of the 1990s, when Abkhazia declared itself an independent state for the first time. This easy access to arms means that state violence could easily cascade into a more serious conflict. &quot;It is really very difficult to imagine that local leaders could hire some external group of bodyguards to enter the presidential administration and throw out protesters by force. That would definitely have led to further bloodshed,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;Each local family has access to weaponry &#x2014; and everyone knows it. It is a threat that can be activated the moment someone feels that their rights are violated. It&apos;s like a nuclear weapon nobody wants to use,&quot; she adds. Until recently, Abkhazia&apos;s de-facto leadership had found a simple answer to uncomfortable Russian demands: endless delays and procrastination. The Russian businesses, many of whom are taking an increasing interest in places like Abkhazia as sanctions bar them from investing elsewhere, have been vocal in their dissatisfaction. &quot;Previously, Russian companies wouldn&apos;t want to invest in (occupied territories like) Abkhazia so as not to spoil their relations with Western partners,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;After being sanctioned, that doesn&apos;t matter anymore.&quot; Yet, while this foot-dragging is irksome, it is not necessarily worrying for Moscow. With the Kremlin&apos;s ultimate trump card in hand &#x2014; Russia&apos;s control of the occupied region&apos;s political survivability &#x2014; it is unlikely that officials in Sukhumi can outrun Moscow&apos;s demands indefinitely. &quot;If Russia is financing Abkhazia, they will be asking for something in return. Now, maybe this particular investment bill was not so high on Russia&apos;s political agenda, but these demands will be back again sooner or later,&quot; says Sieniawski. &quot;I think this dynamic of attempted resistance will remain, but the question is to what extent they can resist.&quot; A once opulent Soviet era train station sits in ruins in the contested region of Sukhumi, Abkhazia.

(Daro Sulakauri/Getty Images)Even the prospect of power change and early elections in Abkhazia does not change this power balance &#x2014; nor the larger geopolitical picture that matters so much to the Kremlin. While the protesters who stormed the Abkhazian parliament may not have wanted to welcome Russian neighbors, they also weren&apos;t pushing to change the status quo&#x2014;for example, for the rapprochement with Georgia, which lost control of the occupied territory after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Russian invasion years after. As long as the larger picture &#x2014; the balance of power, the wider geopolitical plans &#x2014; remains stable, Moscow can simply adjust the details of the deal with whoever becomes Sukhumi&apos;s next de facto leader. &quot;In real terms, for Russia, nothing changes. They are still a dominant player. They are still expected to pay local salaries,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;If other foreign countries were to start recognizing Abkhazia as an independent state, then that might concern the Kremlin because it would provide Sukhumi with more space to maneuver. But I don&apos;t see that happening.&quot; &quot;Moscow has nothing to worry about in Abkhazia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-popular-uprising-kremlins-grip-on-occupied-abkhazia-runs-supreme/	2024-11-26T09:56:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1371843319.jpg
Ukrainian energy giant says it's 'disappointed' by report on EBRD's refusal to fund it	Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, said on Nov. 26 that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; by a report that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. The statement is a response to an article published by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The newspaper reported on Nov. 24 that Odile Renaud-Basso, the president of the EBRD, had said the bank would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by Akhmetov. The EBRD is one of Ukraine&apos;s largest institutional investors. DTEK said it is &quot;disappointed&quot; by these comments, describing them as &quot;inaccurate information about the company and its shareholder.&quot; &quot;The goal of freeing the economy from the influence of oligarchs is absolutely essential, and we have very firm ideas on this: it is part of the reforms that must be made for Ukraine to join the European Union. If we accepted compromises on this issue, we would harm the country&apos;s long-term prospects,&quot; Odile Renaud-Basso said. DETEK also said that it is working with Western partners to restore infrastructure destroyed by Russia and to integrate the country&apos;s energy system into the EU. In response, the EBRD said that Renaud-Basso did not mention Akhmetov&apos;s name in the interview and did not link &quot;compromises&quot; to harming Ukraine&apos;s chances of joining the EU. &quot;She stated that the bank is &apos;vigilant&apos; about the role of oligarchs in this context,&quot; the EBRD added. Akhmetov is Ukraine&apos;s wealthiest man, with vast holdings in mining and metallurgy. Formerly a lawmaker of the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the business tycoon has lost a large part of his assets during Russia&apos;s invasion. DTEK said that the company, which produces 12% of Ukraine&apos;s critical electricity, &quot;is not a monopoly under either Ukrainian or European legislation.&quot; &quot;Following the adoption of the anti-oligarch law, which has been agreed upon with the European Commission, the company&#x2019;s shareholder is categorically not an oligarch,&quot; DTEK added. DTEK also said that the company had invested $1.2 billion of its own funds to restore energy infrastructure and thanked the EU and the U.S. for a decision to allocate 107 million euros ($112 million) to the company. Earlier this year Russian attacks destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign that aimed to knock out Ukraine&apos;s power grid. &quot;The company hopes that the EBRD will further contribute to the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector. DTEK is ready to work with the bank to secure peace and light in Ukraine,&quot; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-energy-giant-responds-to-ebrd-over-company-funding-comments/	2024-11-26T08:42:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147953019.jpg
Russian assets seized under REPO act face uncertain future under Trump	There are some $4-5 billion of frozen Russian assets in the U.S. and it will be up to President-elect Donald Trump to decide what to do with them when he takes office in January 2025.After Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze around $300 billion of assets belonging to the Russian Central Bank. The EU harbors around $220 billion, with $192 billion frozen in Brussels-based company Euroclear, as well as $26 billion in private assets.The West has been divided about whether to confiscate the assets and hand them over to Ukraine. The G7 took a unified step in October by using the windfall profits to back $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loans, of which the U.S. will provide $20 billion, to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction, economic, and defense needs. The U.S. has so far led the charge after President Joe Biden signed the REPO Act in April. The bill green lit the confiscation of frozen Russian assets in the U.S. for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. As part of the bill, the U.S. had to locate all Russian assets within its jurisdiction by August. Washington has so far not publicly released a report on the number of assets.

(Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty Images)Trump has not directly commented on the frozen Russian assets and his unpredictability makes it hard to know which route he will take. Mobilizing the assets and making Russia pay fits in with his strong-man approach but he may also err on the side of caution for fear of foreign countries, like China and Saudi Arabia, pulling out their assets from the U.S. Trump&#x2019;s decision will also impact Europe. He could pressure a reluctant Brussels to pick up the slack and resolve the EU&#x2019;s bickering over the issue. If Trump doesn&#x2019;t confiscate U.S.-based assets or he cuts funding for Ukraine, Brussels may have to reevaluate its position on sending Kyiv the lump sum as the country&#x2019;s defense and reconstruction costs pile up.At least for now, it seems unlikely that Trump would unfreeze the assets and hand them back to Russia. While he has the legal power to suggest repealing or amending the REPO Act, the decision has to pass through Congress. Many Republicans support confiscation of the assets, including House Speaker Republican Congressman Mike Johnson.&#x201C;There&apos;s no automatic procedure for Trump to get rid of this whole thing entirely,&#x201D; Anna Vlasyuk, a legal research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) told the Kyiv Independent. The REPO Act states that the assets should go into a non-interest-bearing Ukrainian support fund to be used for humanitarian help and reconstruction, last estimated at $486 billion, under the administration of the Secretary of State. It also says that the decision to liquidate the assets needs to be multilateral across all partners. In other words, the U.S. won&apos;t do it unless the other G7 nations confirm they will follow suit. Brussels and London have been bogged down in a debate about what to do with the assets. Opponents have lobbied against transferring the funds to Ukraine, citing concerns that it could destabilize G7 currencies if other countries pull their assets out of the West for fear they could be targeted next.If Trump does confiscate the assets and the EU doesn&#x2019;t, then countries friendly with Russia could pull their assets from the U.S. and buy bonds in Europe instead, said Vlasyuk. If Trump opts for liquidation, there is an incentive for him to push the others to act as well so as not to destabilize the U.S. dollar. &#x201C;If Trump supports full confiscation, he could apply stronger pressure on the EU than Biden has been able to.&#x201D;The REPO Act has tried to mitigate fears from other countries by explicitly saying that the bill only covers Russian assets, as opposed to those of Russia-friendly countries, due to the unique circumstances of the invasion of Ukraine. It underlines that confiscation is legal as Russia has violated international law thus undermining its sovereign immunity. The G7 leaders during a summit in Apulia, Italy, on June 13, 2024. (German Chancellor Olaf Scholz/X)Vlasyuk says the risks presented by opponents of confiscation are blown out of proportion and that G7 currencies are too dominant to divest from. She pointed out that when the RCB ditched the U.S. dollar in 2021, it increased its Euro shares instead of solely relying on non-G7 currencies like the Yuan. &#x201C;The RCB would like to avoid currencies like dollars, euros, and pounds. But it can&apos;t afford it economically,&#x201D; she said. The EU, nonetheless, has remained cautious and agreed in March to only use the profits generated from Russian assets, approximately $3.2 billion. The G7&#x2019;s ERA loans are so far the most notable breakthrough and will be in Ukraine&#x2019;s hands by the end of the year. While President Volodymyr Zelensky supported the $50 billion loan, he has stressed that the G7 should still go ahead with the full confiscation. The REPO Act is broad in terms of what it covers, meaning Trump can go after the property, bank accounts, and securities belonging to Russian state-owned companies in the U.S. in addition to oligarch assets. Vlasyuk believes going after Russian state-owned companies will be an easier option for Trump than oligarch assets. In the U.S., legally proving that individuals are directly complicit in Russia&#x2019;s aggression is an &#x201C;uphill battle,&#x201D; she said. But while the bill obligates the president to locate the Russian assets it does not force confiscation. Trump could simply leave them immobilized without transferring the money to Ukraine if he thinks there is a risk to the U.S. dollar. Already, Trump has raised alarm bells in Europe by indicating he could cut U.S. aid for Ukraine. If he decides not to act, then a cash-strapped Europe may consider liquidating the assets without Washington to keep funding Ukraine, although this could result in Russia divesting from the Euro, said Vlasyuk. Trump has insinuated that he will push for negotiations with Russia to freeze the war, previously claiming he could end it &quot;in 24 hours.&quot; Halushka says there is a risk that he could use the assets as a bargaining chip. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) looks at U.S. President Donald Trump during the welcoming ceremony before the G20 Summit&apos;s Plenary Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Nov. 30, 2018. (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)&#x201C;This approach is weak: Russia has already accepted the loss of these funds, and freezing them hasn&#x2019;t pressured Moscow into stopping the war,&#x201D; she said. Instead, Kyiv needs to convince its partners that it will be more worthwhile liquidating the assets for its needs, she added. The REPO Act does not state that the assets can be used for defense purposes. But if Trump pushes the EU to confiscate the money, then Europe could set aside part of the funds to purchase weapons from the U.S., either with the windfall profits or investing the confiscated money. This will see the EU increase its support and satisfy Trump while boosting the American defense industry and creating jobs, said Halushka. Ukraine will receive much-needed weapons and rely less on the political turbulence of its partners. &#x201C;If these assets are confiscated and a significant portion is directed toward purchasing American weapons for Ukraine, it creates a win-win situation,&#x201D; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-assets-seized-under-repo-act-face-uncertain-future-under-trump/	2024-11-26T08:25:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
Kuleba: Joe Rogan, let’s talk and set the record straight on Ukraine	Joe Rogan lashed out at Ukraine on his latest podcast, expressing strong criticism of the United States for lifting restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of U.S.-supplied weapons to target Russian territory and launching an expletive-laden rant accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of pushing to &#x201C;start World War III.&#x201D; Love him or hate him, Rogan commands an enormous, loyal audience. His platform thrives on pushing boundaries, challenging conventional ideas, and creating viral moments. But while he paints himself as a fearless truth-teller, it&#x2019;s striking how one-sided the conversation becomes when he tackles something as complex as Ukraine. Denigrating Ukrainians without giving them a chance to respond isn&#x2019;t just unfair &#x2014; it&#x2019;s emblematic of a larger issue: the persistent tendency to discuss Ukraine without involving Ukrainians. For years, Ukraine has been at the heart of global debates about war, world politics, and resilience. In Rogan&#x2019;s corner, everyone seems to have an opinion about us, but few take the time to actually listen to Ukrainians. On platforms like Rogan&#x2019;s &#x2014; where opinions flow freely and bold claims are the currency &#x2014; our voices are conspicuously absent. Rogan and other podcasters often criticize traditional media for silencing dissenting voices. That&#x2019;s fair. But when he speaks about Ukraine without inviting Ukrainian perspectives, doesn&#x2019;t he become the very thing he rails against? A show that prides itself on being a &#x201C;no-holds-barred&#x201D; forum for tough conversations can&#x2019;t ignore the glaring contradiction of excluding those most affected by the topic. The war Ukraine is fighting isn&#x2019;t just about NATO or territorial disputes &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about survival. Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle is about preserving a nation, culture, and right to live free from tyranny. These aren&#x2019;t abstract concepts or buzzwords for us; they&#x2019;re lived realities. Reducing them to fodder for a podcast feels not just dismissive but infuriating. American podcaster Joe Rogan (L) poses for a photo with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump (R) in New York City, NY, U.S., on Nov. 16, 2024. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)I&#x2019;ve extended an open invitation to Rogan to have a real conversation &#x2014; to present the full picture, not just a one-sided narrative. Ironically, Rogan resembles the mainstream media he criticizes for distorting the truth, while I find myself in his usual role, trying to set the record straight. Quite the role reversal. But let&#x2019;s be honest &#x2014; Rogan likely won&#x2019;t respond. His goal isn&#x2019;t fostering genuine dialogue; it&#x2019;s reinforcing his narrative. He&#x2019;s playing to his audience, and challenging that dynamic isn&#x2019;t easy. Still, engaging voices like his isn&#x2019;t about ego &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about necessity. Rogan&#x2019;s comments serve as a wake-up call for anyone who argues &#x2014; like some did in response to my post on X &#x2014; that figures like me shouldn&#x2019;t &#x201C;lower themselves&#x201D; by engaging with people like him. Whether you like Rogan or not, his audience represents a critical segment of the conversation, including Americans who voted for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and whose views will shape the future of U.S.-Ukraine relations. Ignoring that reality doesn&#x2019;t make it go away. You can&#x2019;t break the echo chamber by pretending it doesn&#x2019;t exist. What Rogan may not understand about Ukrainians is that we&#x2019;re stubborn. We&#x2019;ve had to be. We&#x2019;ve built our strength not in gyms but in fields, factories, and battles. For centuries, we&#x2019;ve fought for our independence and our place in the world. So when someone comes after us, we don&#x2019;t back down. We engage &#x2014; with words, ideas, and, when necessary, fists. But as a diplomat and a fellow cigar aficionado, I suggested we start with a cigar.

Russian Defense Ministry admits that Ukraine hit airbase in Kursk Oblast with ATACMS	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry admitted on Nov. 26 that Ukraine had targeted Russian S-400 air defense systems and an airfield in embattled Kursk Oblast with U.S.-made long-range ATACMS missiles over the past three days. The statement is the first public confirmation of the attacks by Russia, following multiple reports of strikes after Washington permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to the ministry, Ukrainian forces launched five ATACMS missiles on Nov. 23 near the village of Lotarevka, some 37 km northwest of Kursk, with three of them shot down. The other two missiles hit the positions of an S-400 surface-to-air missile division. &quot;The strike damaged a radar. There are casualties among the personnel,&quot; the Defense Ministry said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also claimed that Ukraine had struck a Russian S-400 radar in Kursk Oblast. &#xA0; Ukraine also fired eight ATACMS missiles on Nov. 25 at the Kursk Vostochny airbase in the town of Khalino in Kursk Oblast, seven of which were allegedly shot down by Russian air defenses, the Russian ministry claimed. One of the missiles &quot;reached its target,&quot; injuring two soldiers and damaging infrastructure, the ministry said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. While OSINT analysts earlier reported the strike against the Russian airbase, the Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-airbase-in-kursk-oblast-with-atacms-missile-russian-defense-ministry-claims/	2024-11-26T07:22:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-26_15-09-07.jpg
Ukraine’s drones have a reputation for low cost. Buntar Aerospace wants to make them boutique	The day Russia invaded Ukraine, Ivan Kaunov watched from his 23rd-floor Kyiv apartment in disbelief as rockets came down on his city. He was 30, married, and running a fintech startup that was seeing remarkable traction. The scion of a Kyivan family that had gotten wealthy on construction and IT, Kaunov had gone to university for marketing, doing a student officer training program to satisfy Ukraine&#x2019;s theoretically mandatory but half-heartedly enforced nine-month military requirement &#x2014; &#xA0;training he never expected to use. &#x201C;I said &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll go fight if there&#x2019;s ever a war,&#x2019;&#x201D; chuckled Kaunov. &#x201C;I never thought it would happen. I was sure there would be no invasion. I was thinking, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the 21st century.&#x2019;&#x201D; In mid-March 2022, he joined. Leading 150 fresh recruits to defend a village east of Bakhmut, he would find himself blown up by a rocket as his unit was pulling back from Russia&#x2019;s advance on the Donbas that May. A head injury meant rejoining infantry assaults was a no-go, but with drones, he could return to the fight. After spending around a year piloting mostly reconnaissance drones, Kaunov recognized the need for a more perfect guidance system. He assembled a wishlist of the best gear to put into a Ukrainian drone that would be meant for long-term, deep surveillance usage. He rallied enough interest to translate into funding for a prototype of the Buntar-1, the basis for his current company, Buntar Aerospace. Rather than fall to Russian jammers or a kamikaze attack, the envisioned Buntar &#x2014; the Ukrainian name for the Star Wars: Rogue movie &#x2014; would live to fly another day. Over the past year, Buntar has armed itself with nearly $3 million in investment from Ukraine, the EU, and the U.S. and is building what Kaunov hopes will be the Cadillac of Ukrainian surveillance drones &#x2013; high-cost, premium quality, and repeat usage &#x2014; in a major divergence from the cheap one-time kamikaze drones that have become symbols of Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The company&apos;s latest model is the Buntar-3, a sleek machine to be sold in kits of two for some $200,000, decked out with Western components with the exception of Chinese wiring. The Buntar Aerospace team is currently taking the Buntar-3 along the front line for testing. Ukrainian drone pilots typically rely on cheap models &#x2014; initially Chinese-made consumer models like DJI Mavics &#x2014; but today, mostly analogs made in Ukraine. The assumption remains that most will fall in flight. Buntar says it is different in that it aims squarely for the top shelf of the market. The radios on the Buntar 1 are, for example, U.S. imports, a trio of high-end models from L3Harris, Persistent Systems MQ5, and Silvus. And the cameras, if including night vision, can run up to $75,000 &#x2014; the most expensive part of any recon drone. Buntar&#x2019;s premium drones recently started probing the front lines. But as with many of the most ambitious Ukrainian drone firms, the guiding light is not just to win the war, but, ultimately, the West, specifically a Western arms market that&#x2019;s been following the war in Ukraine raptly. The team recently began front-line tests on the Buntar-3 and boasts a connectivity time of 98% &#x2014; a massive improvement over the 30% of more rank-and-file drones that they attribute to the quality of components, which hail from the U.S. and U.K. in addition to Ukraine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the biggest war since WWII. Lots of new technology, lots of electronic warfare,&#x201D; says Bohdan Sas, Buntar&#x2019;s Chief Technology Officer. &#x201C;Drones that were designed by civilian engineers for a civil environment before the war don&#x2019;t work in this war. So this is all custom.&#x201D; Beyond his experience at the front, the highly extroverted, heavily tatted, and always clean-shaven Kaunov is a convincing ambassador for the Buntar brand. His is a classic story of Ukraine&#x2019;s current generation of military tech startups: A soldier with a background in IT and Western financing who managed to blend the three into his own drone project. Kaunov&#x2019;s drone work lines up closely with the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a game changer in Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia. By 2023, the Ukrainian government understood it had a unique development on its hands and started pouring money into the domestic drone industry. That industry has grown rapidly and by many accounts is producing the majority of drones Ukraine is using on the front these days. The Buntar-1 in flight on June 29, 2024. takeoff at a test site in an undisclosed location, Ukraine on June 29, 2024. (Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Given the ad-hoc means by which many drones make it to the front, hard numbers are tough to come by. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-October that the government had already achieved its goal of one million Ukrainian drones produced in 2024. The Royal United Services Institute, a U.K.-based think tank, last year estimated Ukraine&#x2019;s drone losses at 10,000 units per month. Very few Ukrainian drones cost even the $20,000 that Buntar is asking for its cheaper recon drone, the Skyhopper. Buntar counts &#x201C;tens&#x201D; of its fixed-wing Skyhoppers already sold to the front. &#x201C;Each unit completes dozens of missions, maintaining high altitudes to avoid being shot down,&#x201D; says Kaunov. Thus far, Kaunov says only one Skyhopper has gone down &#x2014; due to friendly fire. &#x201C;I know exactly the tree it&#x2019;s in in no-man&#x2019;s land. Not worth trying to get,&#x201D; he says. The Buntar units 1, 2, and 3 are still in testing, with Buntar-1 seeing some performance at the front lines. Kaunov says the Buntar-3 has achieved a flight time of three hours &#x2014; putting it up there with the German Quantum Systems&#x2019; Vector and the Estonian Threod&#x2019;s EOS VTOL, two drones that Kaunov sees as future competitors, which similarly run nearly 200,000 euros per system. CoPilot, the company&#x2019;s navigating and auto-piloting software, is likely the most marketable of Buntar&#x2019;s products right now, provided it can readily adapt to new drone hardware and be brought on board new mission types. Software is easier to scale up than physical factories and the Ukrainian government maintains strict controls on the export of military goods. With its software registered abroad, CoPilot is theoretically free to go into the drone systems of foreign militaries. But here, Buntar has a leg up. Part of the firm&#x2019;s success is thanks to Kaunov&#x2019;s connections to the West, and, particularly, his knowledge of Western business financing. Prior to the full-scale invasion, his last project was FinMap, a still-functioning company selling B2B budgeting software. Kaunov&#x2019;s FinMap co-founder Oleksandr Solovei continues running FinMap today. As is typical of startups, Buntar remains a much more public-facing company than many of the massive drone makers who are at this point well-established in Ukraine but who keep relatively low profiles. Like FinMap, Buntar Aerospace operates via a U.K. company that has eased the process of getting Western investment and, Kaunov hopes, sales. Buntar has managed to gather up $2.7 million in funding in just 13 months of existence. By the standards of Silicon Valley, it&#x2019;s not a massive sum, but among the young generation of Ukrainian military tech startups, it&#x2019;s one of the larger publicly acknowledged war chests. Other leaders include drone software company Swarmer and disinformation startup Osavul, both using AI, who announced similar funding rounds in September. For comparison, many defense startups in Ukraine rely on $25,000 government grants to get off the ground. In addition to new drone models and workshops, Buntar has used the new funds to staff up, employing some 60 people, including Kaunov&#x2019;s father, Serhiy, and three brothers. Several of Buntar&#x2019;s investors remain unidentified. Buntar received a grant from Brave1, a government program for miltech, as well as various government awards. Private investors include several founders of Uklon, a Ukrainian equivalent to Uber. The funding allowed Buntar to acquire a smaller UAV manufacturer over the summer. Despite Buntar&#x2019;s financial savvy, questions remain about the battlefield readiness of Buntar drones. The Belgium-based Seven Capital is another early investor concerned about the core product. &#x201C;About Buntar, we&#x2019;ve had a lot of great feedback from investors. But not from the polihon (drone testing field). Not from soldiers. Not from our engineers,&#x201D; Brent Christiaens, founder and managing partner of Seven Capital, tells the Kyiv Independent. Buntar has already expanded rapidly, currently working on several updates to the Buntar-1, continued production of the Skyhopper, and a new line of kamikaze drones. The firm is currently working out production in the U.K., which would allow them to avoid the export controls currently holding more or less all drones made within Ukraine inside the country. Getting around those controls is, however, a controversial proposition during wartime. While the war guarantees local demand, it&#x2019;s tough to build a drone that can compensate investors and keep staff fed within Ukraine, where the Defense Ministry caps profits on military hardware at 25% over cost. Whether Western buyers will be open to a Ukrainian drone competing on equal footing with those built by German, U.K. or Israeli companies is a question that may well go unanswered until after the war.

(Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Buntar is in a fairly unique situation in that it has money and staff that allowed the project to draw eyes even before getting their first planes to market, thanks in no small part to Kaunov&#x2019;s marketing acumen. He anticipates the Skyhoppers, which Buntar prices at around $20,000, receiving a contract from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry before the end of this year, and says that the Buntar-3s just passed tests critical to securing such a contract of its own. But if the higher-end planes currently under testing don&#x2019;t pass muster, Buntar could well flounder. Kaunov anticipates a ceasefire of sorts in the next year but sees Ukraine continuing to buy up weapons for its arsenal afterward on the assumption that Russia will be back. Like many of his peers building defense tech in Ukraine, he&#x2019;s hopeful that before a ceasefire Buntar will prove itself in battle enough that Western militaries will clamor for it on the basis of quality, rather than cost. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-drones-have-a-reputation-for-low-cost-buntar-aerospace-wants-to-make-them-boutique/	2024-11-26T06:44:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/buntar-ground-rep.jpg
EU's upcoming Russia sanctions to target North Korean officials, Chinese, Indian companies, Ukrainian official says	The EU&apos;s 15th sanctions package will include 30 legal entities from at least eight countries and 50 individuals, the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s commissioner for sanctions, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, said on Nov. 26. According to Vlasiuk, &quot;companies that help Moscow obtain critical components&quot; will be on the sanction&#x2019;s list, &quot;including entities from Russia, Serbia, Iran, Hong Kong, China, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Thailand.&quot; The list will also include &quot;North Korean officials involved in the dispatch of troops to Russia,&quot; said the Ukrainian official who was involved in the package&apos;s preparations. North Korea is believed to have sent over 10,000 troops to boost Russian forces, with the first clashes with Ukraine already reported in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ahead of the coming sanctions package, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called upon the EU not to sanction Chinese entities or individuals, claiming that China never supplied weapons to the parties to the conflict. Overwhelming evidence shows that Russian military hardware, especially drones, contain parts supplied by China. Recent reports indicate that the EU obtained evidence of China&apos;s production of &quot;lethal aid&quot; for Russia, namely attack drones. The upcoming package will also reportedly ban access for 45 Russian oil tankers to European ports and sanction oil transportation companies and their executives. Shortly after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU introduced sanctions on key figures of Russia&#x2019;s energy and military industry, curtailed Russia&apos;s access to Western-operated financial services, and froze Russia&#x2019;s assets held in Western bank accounts. Loopholes and malicious actors allowed countries and individuals to evade sanctions and continue doing business with Russia, necessitating the introduction of further packages and fine-tuning of the existing ones.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-15th-sanctions-package/	2024-11-26T06:10:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Supreme Court puts an end to oligarch Kolomoisky's appeal for restoring Privatbank ownership	Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court on Nov. 26 upheld earlier rulings on nationalizing Ukraine&apos;s largest bank and dismissed an appeal of its former owner Ihor Kolomoisky, ending a years-long case. Kolomoisky, one of the country&apos;s most well-known and controversial oligarchs, co-founded PrivatBank in 1992 but lost ownership to the state in 2016 after his management left a $5.5 billion hole in its balance sheet. The oligarch was later charged with embezzling $220 million from PrivatBank and has been in detention since September 2023 pending trial over multiple charges of fraud, illegal property acquisition, money laundering, and a murder plot. Kolomoisky is the richest businessman to be imprisoned in Ukraine&apos;s independent history. &quot;The Commercial Court of Cassation of the Supreme Court... rejected the cassation appeals of the former shareholders of PrivatBank Ihor Kolomoisky and the Cypriot company Triantal Investments Ltd.&quot; and upheld earlier rulings of the Commercial Court of the City of Kyiv from May and the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal from September, the statement read. The decision ended proceedings that had been ongoing for almost five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/kolomoisky-privatbank/	2024-11-26T05:40:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kolomo.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of executing 5 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk	Russian forces apparently shot five unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 26, launching a war crime investigation. According to the statement, Russian troops captured five Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector. After forcing them to lay down their weapons and lie down on the ground, they are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. &quot;An investigation is currently underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime and the persons involved,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he had notified the United Nations and the Red Cross regarding the latest case from the Pokrovsk sector. &quot;I emphasize that the killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is qualified as a serious international crime,&quot; he wrote. Last week, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported two other Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk sector. Law enforcement officers are investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-suspected-of-executing-5-ukrainian-pows-near-pokrovsk/	2024-11-26T05:08:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165903706.jpg
Opinion: Russia is leveraging gold and working with China to bypass Western sanctions	Since the West imposed unprecedented economic pressure on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s trade practices have undergone a dramatic transformation, with Russian international trade increasingly occurring in the shadows. Access to the goods it needs now depends on constant scheming. Given that Russia operates under informal rules, this shift comes naturally. Understanding this &#x2014; and, particularly, the role of Russia&#x2019;s new patron, China &#x2014; could help ensure that pressure on Russia&#x2019;s war economy is applied most effectively. History shows that when the Kremlin faces a crisis &#x2014; such as a war or a five-year plan &#x2014; officials and businesses become more entrepreneurial in an effort to meet extraordinary goals. Today, the Kremlin is encouraging officials and businesses to develop new workarounds &#x2014; informal or illicit activities &#x2014; that undermine conventional trading practices. These include the sale of Russia&#x2019;s most important commodity via a shadow fleet, the purchase of weapons with gold from Iran or North Korea, and a growing network of import-export entrepreneurs who channel foreign goods to Russia through third countries. Russia&#x2019;s most pressing trade challenge is how to pay foreign counterparts concerned about secondary sanctions, especially in China, on which Russia has become increasingly dependent for imports. Three trends are clear. First, Russia is formalizing informal trading. This began in 2022 with the legalization of gray imports, but now includes barter trading and exchange in kind. Barter trading has a long history in Russia, given its commodity-based economy, with the state historically striking deals for natural resources. However, barter relies on willing trade partners, and it remains to be seen how widespread it will become. Second, the Russian state is scrambling to create payment systems that avoid exposure to, or provide an alternative to, the dollar. As we saw during the recent BRICS conference in Kazan, these include central bank-backed digital currencies. While such systems may work in principle, Russian technologies often rely on foreign cooperation and components, and it remains unclear whether the Kremlin can count on uptake from its BRICS partners. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses a BRICS parliamentary forum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on July 11, 2024. (Valery Shatifulin / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)A third trend is the use of gold and other precious stones, such as diamonds, as payment. This may be Russia&#x2019;s most promising workaround payment option. Russia is a major gold producer and hoarder, consistently producing over 300 tonnes of gold annually. Russian interests also control large stakes in gold-producing countries in Eurasia and Africa. Thus, even if Russia spends its gold, it has ample access to more. As recent research by RAND has shown, over the last 20 years, Russia&#x2019;s central bank has acquired nearly 2,000 tonnes of gold &#x2014; more than any other country by a wide margin. Moreover, the state regularly adds to a vault controlled by the Ministry of Finance, which holds an undisclosed amount of gold and precious stones that can be used at Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s discretion. There is little doubt that Russia is already using gold to pay for goods it cannot procure conventionally, or for transactions it wishes to obscure. An open-source investigation by Sayari, for example, revealed that unsanctioned banks were trading gold for cash in Turkey. Russia has also partly paid Iranian drone manufacturer Sahara Thunder in gold for 6,000 Shahed drones and related equipment. While it&#x2019;s unclear how much of a role gold plays in Russia&#x2019;s trade with China, it is certainly &#xA0;becoming a growing feature. Russian gold exports to China increased after the U.S., UK, and EU banned Russian gold imports in 2022. Chinese demand for gold has been very high from 2022 to the second half of this year, when rising gold prices slowed purchasing. According to World Gold Council data, the People&#x2019;s Bank of China has acquired more gold during this period than any other country. It&#x2019;s plausible that Beijing, like Moscow, holds undisclosed gold, as its declared reserves represent less than 5% of its overall holdings &#x2014; far less than comparable economies. Indeed, around half of global gold purchases since March are unaccounted for, and it&#x2019;s unclear what is driving such high demand. In 2023, China became a key hub for Russia&#x2019;s international gold trade after secondary sanctions deterred the UAE, which had become Russia&#x2019;s main partner after the West banned Russian gold imports. On the surface, China does not appear to covet Russian gold, given its security of supply and investments in foreign gold assets, including in Afghanistan, Ghana, and Tajikistan. Additionally, China does not hold significant investments in Russia&#x2019;s largest gold mining companies. It&#x2019;s also unclear how much Russian gold ore China now refines, since international demand for Russia-refined gold bars has fallen since 2022. However, the development of gold relations deserves further attention, especially considering the rising demand for gold among Chinese consumers, which may increase due to concerns over the stability of the domestic economy and potential renewed trade tensions with the incoming U.S. administration. If relations with the U.S. worsen, China may be more willing to collaborate with Russia in the creation of a de-dollarized trading bloc, where gold could play a significant role. This has already become an important rhetorical theme in their relations, and both Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have declared their intent to deepen cooperation at the BRICS summit. Recent reports suggest that China is providing direct support to Russian defense production, signaling that China is more willing to risk Western sanctions than previously thought. In August, China tightened controls on payments with Russian companies, causing delays in bilateral trade. However, it has not prevented traders from using gold to settle payments for Russian businesses. Reporting indicates that Russian companies have been selling gold in Hong Kong and depositing the proceeds in local bank accounts to pay Chinese suppliers in lieu of using yuan or rubles directly. In this way, China is tolerating Russian workarounds &#x2014; a form of preemptive sanctions evasion. Chinese tolerance for Russia-related risk is not unlimited, but it is clearly supporting Russia&#x2019;s workaround trade. The pressure on Beijing to assist Moscow is unlikely to subside, and gold offers a range of possibilities to extend and obfuscate their cooperation.

Russia confirms capture of UK national fighting for Ukraine	Russian authorities confirmed on Nov. 26 the capture and detention of James Scott Rhys Anderson, a U.K. national fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Russian Investigative Committee charged Anderson with &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;mercenarism,&quot; following its long-standing practice of persecuting foreign volunteers that end up in Russian captivity. A video purportedly showing the captured volunteer surfaced on Telegram channels on Nov. 24. Speaking with an English accent, the man identified himself as Anderson, a 22-year-old ex-British army signalman who, in his own words, came to Ukraine and joined the International Legion. Russia often presents foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. Scott Anderson, the 22-year-old&apos;s father, told the Daily Mail that he &quot;was in complete shock and in tears&quot; when the fighter&apos;s commander sent him the video. &quot;I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared, and worried,&quot; Scott Anderson said, voicing fears that his son would be tortured in prison. Two other Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange. Russia has ramped up pressure in Kursk Oblast to dislodge Ukrainian troops holding positions there since early August. Reuters reported on Nov. 23 that Ukraine had lost over 40% of territory previously captured during the incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-captures-uk-volunteer/	2024-11-26T04:28:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Ukraine's Defense Ministry investigating faulty mortar shells following complaints	An interdepartmental commission is investigating the supply of faulty 120 mm mortar shells to Ukrainian forces after multiple reports of them misfiring, the Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 26. The statement comes following complaints and videos shared on social media that show the mortar shells not exploding or failing to hit their targets. The ministry said it had withdrawn the batches of ammunition in question and would instead provide Ukrainian forces with imported shells. The Dzerkalo Tyzhnia news outlet reported in its investigation that this concerns 100,000 shells that would last for six months of front-line use, causing delays before the imported shells arrive. Artillery and mortar shells are crucial items on the front as Ukraine already struggles to match up with the better-stocked Russian forces. According to Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, the supply of the shells in question was a result of a deal between the Defense Ministry and the Strategic Industries Ministry to purchase ammunition from a domestic producer and thus decrease dependence on foreign supplies. The outlet did not name the factory commissioned to manufacture the shells but said it was part of the state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom and was often targeted by Russian attacks. The media investigation highlighted the Defense Ministry&apos;s supposedly inadequate quality control process. Warnings raised by some officials regarding the plant&apos;s ability to produce detonators for the shells &quot;disappeared&quot; during the process, and military officials failed to report initial problems with the shells that surfaced in September. In its statement, the Defense Ministry stressed that the Strategic Industries Ministry was responsible for carrying out the order. Preliminary conclusions named low-quality charges and poor storage conditions as possible causes. The State Bureau of Investigation has launched a criminal investigation, and &quot;appropriate personnel decisions will be made regarding the responsible officials,&quot; the statement read. The ministry promised new measures to improve quality control and improve the inspection process at all stages. Ukraine&apos;s defense sector has been plagued by several major procurement scandals throughout the full-scale war. The two most notorious scandals, one regarding inflated prices for food supplies and the other connected to low-quality winter jackets, prompted the dismissal of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-ministry-investigating-faulty-mortar-shells/	2024-11-26T03:55:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182940696--1-.jpg
NATO Parliamentary Assembly calls for Ukraine's accession 'as soon as possible'	Delegates from NATO member states&#x2019; legislatures voiced their support for Ukraine becoming the 33rd member of the alliance in a resolution adopted by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on Nov. 25. Independent from NATO, the assembly has no direct role in overseeing NATO policies. The assembly urged member states &quot;to step up political and practical efforts to help Ukraine receive an invitation and become the 33rd member of NATO as soon as possible,&quot; the resolution read. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. Seven countries, including the U.S., Germany, and Hungary, are reluctant to greenlight a fast accession for Ukraine, Politico reported in October. Kyiv&apos;s entry would require a unanimous agreement among all 32 members. Members of the Assembly also urged for sustaining and increasing the &quot;military, financial, and humanitarian support for Ukraine, ensuring the timely delivery of munitions and advanced weapon systems, including air defense systems, long-range precision weapons, and multi-role fighter aircraft.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-parliamentary-assembly-ukraine/	2024-11-26T03:02:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416185.jpg
Russia launches record 188 drones against Ukraine overnight, Air Force says	Russia launched a record number of 188 Shaheds and other drones against Ukraine in a single night on Nov. 26, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 76 drones across 17 oblasts, while 95 were &quot;lost,&quot; presumably thanks to electronic warfare means. Five drones flew to Belarus, according to the Air Force. Russia has deployed cheap &quot;kamikaze&quot; drones, like the Iranian-made Shaheds, against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since the first year of the full-scale war. Moscow has intensified the drone attacks in recent months, with air raid alerts sounding daily in major cities like Kyiv. &quot;During the overnight attack, Russia launched a record number of Shahed-type attack drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles of an unknown type from the directions of Orel, Bryans, Kursk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia,&quot; the Air Force&apos;s statement read. Moscow launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine in October, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Talking to the parliament on Nov. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had set a goal of developing an effective countermeasure to Shahed-type drone attacks. Ukraine was also attacked by four Iskander-M ballistic missiles overnight on Nov. 26, the Air Force said. At least two people were killed and over 40 injured in Russian attacks over the past day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-record-188-drones-against-ukraine-overnight/	2024-11-26T02:45:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Ex-Minister Kuleba calls out Joe Rogan over 'freaking at Ukrainians,' asks for 'real conversation'	Ukraine&apos;s Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Nov. 25 called out Joe Rogan for not allowing a pro-Ukrainian voice into his podcast after the popular U.S. podcaster lashed out against Ukraine over supposedly &quot;starting World War III.&quot; &quot;Freaking at Ukrainians without giving them a chance to speak isn&#x2019;t a fair fight,&quot; Kuleba wrote on X. &quot;If you ever feel like having a real conversation, let&#x2019;s sit down and chat about anything Ukraine-related &#x2013; dragons included. You know your stuff, I know mine. Cigars on me,&quot; he added. Kuleba&apos;s rebuke follows that of former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko, who accused Rogan of &quot;repeating Russian propaganda&quot; after the U.S. podcaster lambasted Washington&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. Joe Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters in the world, with over 18 million followers on YouTube. In his recent episode, Rogan voiced fears that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision on long-range strikes could lead to World War III. &quot;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out. Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&quot; Rogan said in a recent episode. During the electoral campaign, Rogan endorsed Donald Trump, who criticized military aid for Ukraine and said he would bring both sides to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has sought to speed up military support for Kyiv before Trump takes office in January. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr) Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said. Kuleba has been in office between 2020 and September 2024. He has been at the forefront of Ukraine&apos;s efforts to engage its international allies and secure new partnerships since the beginning of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-joe-rogan/	2024-11-26T02:06:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168226157.jpg
Russian lawmakers submit bill on Taliban's removal from terrorist list	A group of Russian lawmakers submitted a bill that would allow the Taliban Islamist movement to be removed from Russia&apos;s list of terrorist organizations, the State Duma&apos;s website said on Nov. 25. This comes as another step toward normalization of relations between Russia and the Taliban since the radical group seized power in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021. If approved, the legislation will allow the Taliban to be delisted as a banned terror group if it &quot;stops carrying out activities aimed at promoting, justifying, and supporting terrorism.&quot; The bill was submitted by seven senators and five Duma members from the ruling United Russia party and the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). Taliban is recognized as a terrorist group by the U.S., Canada, United Arab Emirates, and other countries. Its rule, which is not recognized by the international community, has been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on civil liberties and women&apos;s and minority rights. Russia has maintained contact with the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan without officially recognizing the new authorities. Russia&apos;s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Afghanistan on Nov. 25, saying that the removal of the Taliban from the list of terrorist groups is in its &quot;final stage.&quot; &quot;Let me confirm our readiness to establish a constructive political dialogue between our countries and among the goals would be providing an impulse for the process of a settlement among Afghans,&quot; Shoigu reportedly said. &quot;We have tried to ensure conditions for a growth in exports of Afghan goods and a growth in foreign investment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-taliban-duma/	2024-11-26T01:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175722618.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, wound 45 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured at least 45 people and killed at least two over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 26. In Kharkiv&#x2019;s Kyivskyi city district, a Russian S-400 missile injured 26 people and damaged more than 40 buildings and five cars, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. In the town of Kupiansk, a Russian drone injured a 66-year-old man after crashing near an educational institution building. An air raid alert in Kyiv lasted for seven hours last night while Ukrainian air defenses downed Russian drones over the city. No casualties were reported, the regional military administration said. During a night attack on Ternopil Oblast, a critical infrastructure facility was damaged, causing blackouts, the regional military administration reported. One person died, and four were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attack on critical infrastructure and residential areas of Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. One person was killed and another injured in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 48-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man were injured in Nikopol due to a kamikaze drone strike, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. A gas station and a car were also damaged in the attack. In Odesa, the Russian military struck the center of the city, injuring 11 people and leaving one woman in a serious condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported on his Telegram channel. &#x200C;&#x200C; The missile strike damaged residential buildings, cars, a dentist&apos;s clinic, a beauty salon, shops, and cars. Two educational institutions&#x2014;a school and a university gym&#x2014;were also damaged. &#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 74-year-old man was wounded following a Russian strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel. Overnight on Nov. 26, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with four Iskander-M ballistic missiles from the Voronezh and Kursk regions. During the night attack, Russia also launched 188 Shaheds and other unidentified drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Air defense shot down 76 drones over 17 oblasts while 95 drones were lost across the country, and five of them left Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace to Belarus, the Air Force said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2/	2024-11-26T01:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-Nov_-25.jpg
51% of Americans oppose military aid for Ukraine, poll shows	U.S. citizens remain split on whether to continue sending military support to Ukraine, with a razor-thin majority voicing opposition, according to a CBS/YouGov poll published on Nov. 25. While 49% of the respondents said the military support should continue, 51% were against it, underscoring the persistent divide in the U.S. society on the matter. The survey came at the heels of Donald Trump&apos;s election victory, which sparked concerns about the U.S. withdrawing its crucial support for Ukraine. Ukraine initially enjoyed bipartisan support in the U.S. at the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, but a part of the Republican Party has grown increasingly reluctant as the war progressed. The Republican-led House of Representatives delayed for months the approval of a $61 billion aid bill earlier this year, directly contributing to Ukraine&apos;s battlefield setbacks and underscoring how vital U.S. support is for Kyiv. Responding to a question on &quot;how much priority should (Trump) put on developing policies and plans to try to limit aid to Ukraine,&quot; 33% deemed it to be a high priority, 36% a medium priority, and 31% said it was not a priority at all. The survey involved a bipartisan pool of 2,232 respondents and was carried out between Nov. 19 and 22. In an earlier poll published by Pew Research in July, 48% of respondents said that the U.S. has a responsibility to aid Ukraine, while 49% said it does not. Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents were more likely to give a positive answer.	https://kyivindependent.com/51-of-americans-oppose-aid-to-ukraine-poll-shows/	2024-11-26T00:35:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1244028095.jpg
UK not planning to send its soldiers to Ukraine, foreign secretary says	London is not planning to deploy its military personnel on the ground in Ukraine, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told journalists at the G7&apos;s ministerial meeting on Nov. 25. Lammy&apos;s comments came after the French outlet Le Monde reported that the U.K. and France have been discussing deploying soldiers or private defense contractors in Ukraine following Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. &quot;We are not committing U.K. troops on the ground to Ukraine, but we continue to support Ukraine with training and military assistance, and we have been absolutely clear that we will continue to do that for as long as is required and is needed,&quot; Lammy said. &quot;That is certainly the U.K. position and remains the U.K. position at this time.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron previously suggested deploying military trainers to Ukraine, but the idea has met strong opposition among several key allies, namely Germany. Le Monde wrote, citing undisclosed sources, that the matter was brought up during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s visit to France on Nov. 11. The U.K. and France are reportedly considering taking the lead in the pro-Kyiv coalition in the light of Trump&apos;s reelection. Trump has criticized military support for Ukraine and pledged to bring a quick end to the war, sparking fears he might withdraw Washington&apos;s crucial backing. Responding to a question about France deploying its troops in Ukraine, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the media that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot; While the G7 foreign ministers were meeting in Italy, the defense ministers of the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Poland met in Berlin in a new &quot;E5 format&quot; to discuss increasing defense spending and supporting Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pledged to keep the Ukraine Defense Contact Group &quot;alive,&quot; while his British counterpart, John Healey, said that Europe must &quot;double&quot; its support for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-not-sending-its-soldiers-to-ukraine-lammy/	2024-11-25T23:50:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2171444035.jpg
Russia's advance in Ukraine fastest since early 2022, analysts claim	The advance of Russian forces in Ukraine continues to gain pace, reaching a new weekly and monthly record, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Nov. 25, citing its analysis of the DeepState monitoring group&apos;s data. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the analysis. Russian forces have taken 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) since the start of November, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Agentstvo wrote. The development comes at a critical moment as Ukraine faces the prospect of decreased U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s administration. As the president-elect pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table, battlefield losses are likely to put Ukraine at a weakened position. The advance is reportedly the fastest near Velyka Novosilka, a village in southern Donetsk Oblast close to the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. According to Agentstvo&apos;s analysis of DeepState data, Russia captured around 187 square kilometers (72 square miles) in the south. Moscow&apos;s troops have also reportedly advanced 33 square kilometers (12.7 square miles) near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, 10 square kilometers (3.8 square miles) in the east of Kharkiv Oblast, and 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) near Chasiv Yar. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms were not flowing in as fast as Kyiv would have hoped. The outgoing Biden administration seeks to speed up materiel deliveries before Trump takes office. Washington has provided Ukraine&apos;s forces with new capabilities to stall the Russian advance, such as long-range strikes on Russian territory or anti-personnel mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-advance-in-ukraine-fastest-since-early-2022-analysts-say/	2024-11-25T23:10:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1239451817.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 733,830 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 733,830 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 26. This number includes 1,480 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,435 tanks, 19,256 armored fighting vehicles, 30,042 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,806 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,552 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-733-830-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-25T22:28:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Estonia’s defense chief urges financial aid for Ukraine over foreign troop deployments, The Hill reports	Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said during the Halifax International Security Forum that Ukraine needs greater investment in its military production capabilities, not foreign troops on its battlefield. Speaking to The Hill, Pevkur stressed that Ukraine could manage its defense effectively if supplied with the necessary resources. &quot;As far as I know, Ukrainians can handle all of this, when we can deliver all what they need for fighting with Russia,&quot; Pevkur said. Pevkur highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s growing capacity to produce military equipment, including howitzers at six to seven times the rate of France. However, he noted a critical funding gap: &quot;Their industry is really ramping up production... but it only has $15 billion to spend, while its capacity is about $30 billion. So when you don&#x2019;t have anything to give from your own stockpiles, give them money. It&#x2019;s a simple message,&quot; he told The Hill. Reflecting on Ukraine&#x2019;s past counteroffensives, Pevkur called the lack of sufficient equipment during the surprise Kursk incursion in August a missed opportunity. &quot;There was a huge momentum in this war during the Kursk counteroffensive, but that time, Ukrainians didn&#x2019;t have enough equipment or enough firepower to push even further,&quot; he said. He urged Western allies to commit fully to helping Ukraine achieve victory, rather than merely sustaining its fight. Pevkur warned that the next six months of political transitions in the U.S. and Europe could embolden adversaries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Estonia remains vigilant against potential hybrid attacks, with Pevkur citing suspected Russian cyberattacks, sabotage of Baltic undersea cables, and interference with flight communications as examples of ongoing threats. &quot;We know very clearly what Russia is capable of... That is why the prevention of those kinds of attacks, also reaction to those kinds of attacks, is very, very important,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonias-defense-chief-urges-financial-aid-for-ukraine-over-foreign-troop-deployments-the-hill-reports/	2024-11-25T21:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2160736180.jpg
Germany to deliver 2 IRIS-T air defense systems to Ukraine by year's end, ministry says	Germany will supply Ukraine with two additional IRIS-T air defense systems, including the medium-range SLM and short-range SLS models, by the end of the year, Major General Christian Freuding, head of the Bundeswehr&apos;s Situation Center Ukraine, told journalists in Kyiv on Nov. 25. &quot;The next IRIS-T SLM (medium-range) and SLS (short-range) systems should arrive in Ukraine in the coming days and weeks, before Christmas,&quot; Freuding was quoted as saying. He added that Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine would continue beyond Christmas and the Feb. 23 federal elections in Germany. On Nov. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would receive the sixth German IRIS-T air defense system by the end of the year following his call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukraine will then have a total of seven systems in its arsenal. The IRIS-T is a state-of-the-art surface-to-air missile system designed to counter aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. In September, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced plans to deliver an additional 17 IRIS-T systems, further bolstering Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. Germany has been a key defense partner for Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, providing a range of equipment, including IRIS-T and Patriot air defense systems, anti-aircraft and artillery systems, armored vehicles, Leopard tanks, drones, and ammunition. On Nov. &#xA0;20, the German government announced a new military aid package featuring howitzers, vehicles, and hundreds of drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-deliver-2-iris-t-air-defense-systems-to-ukraine-by-years-end-ministry-says/	2024-11-25T20:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169569133.jpg
UK boosts Kyiv's arsenal with more Storm Shadows amid Starmer's support pledge, Bloomberg reports	The U.K. has delivered dozens of Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports, marking the first major arms transfer under Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s leadership. The unannounced shipments carried out weeks ago, were ordered after Ukrainian forces faced shortages of long-range missiles, according to sources familiar with the matter. Officials speaking to Bloomberg, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information, confirmed that the missiles were supplied before the U.K. and the U.S. authorized Ukraine to target locations inside Russia with long-range weapons. The exact timeline and quantity of the shipment remain undisclosed. &quot;We do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit [Russian President Vladimir Putin],&quot; the Ministry of Defense told Bloomberg. The ministry reiterated the U.K.&#x2019;s &quot;ironclad&quot; support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian forces recently used the Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets in the western Bryansk region, one day after deploying U.S.-made ATACMS in similar operations. At the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 20, Starmer said his government was &quot;doubling down&quot; on its support for Ukraine but avoided disclosing specifics. Ukraine had previously used Storm Shadows against Russian forces in the Black Sea, though the U.K. government has not confirmed the total number supplied since the war began. The missiles, manufactured by MBDA, a defense company that provides missile systems for each branch of the armed forces, are precision-guided and boast a range exceeding 250 kilometers. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they are designed to fly close to terrain at high speeds, enhancing their effectiveness in striking critical targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-boosts-kyivs-arsenal-with-more-storm-shadows-amid-starmers-support-pledge-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-25T17:51:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1905088005.jpg
No indication North Korean troops are moving into Ukraine, Pentagon says	The United States does not have any indication that there is a presence of North Korean troops in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said on Nov. 25. &quot;What we&apos;re seeing is that (North Korean troops are) positioned around the Kursk region, not moving into Ukraine at the moment,&quot; Singh said during a press briefing. The Pentagon&apos;s statement clarifies reports of approximately 11,000 North Korean troops amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, training alongside Russian troops in the fight against Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Nov. 13 that some North Korean troops have already been deployed to fight together with Russian forces. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. Addressing unconfirmed reports that upwards of 500 North Korean troops have been killed in Kursk, Singh said that the U.S. could not independently confirm the casualties. &quot;What we&apos;ve said before is that they&apos;re in (the Kursk) region and certainly poised to engage the Ukrainians in combat. But I can&apos;t confirm those reports that there have been casualties yet.&quot; Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either country comes under attack. On Nov. 25, Reuters reported, citing researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, that North Korea is expanding a key weapons production complex that assembles KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles used by Russia against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-indication-north-korean-troops-are-moving-into-ukraine-pentagon-says/	2024-11-25T17:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
G7 allies expected to increase pressure on China over support for Russia, Bloomberg reports	The foreign ministers of Group of Seven (G7) countries are expected to agree to increase diplomatic pressure on China over the country&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s &apos;war machine&apos; in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 25, citing an early draft of a communique seen by the publication. The draft communique, which vows to introduce &quot;appropriate measures consistent with our legal systems, against actors in China and in other third countries,&quot; is still in development as G7 foreign ministers meet in Italy on Nov. 25-26, Bloomberg reported. If adopted, the language of the communique would mark an escalation among G7 allies, with an April communique simply calling for China to &quot;ensure&quot; that it stops supporting Russia with dual-use goods. The reported draft communique comes as G7 allies attempt to increase pressure, as well as support for Ukraine, ahead of the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump &#x2014; who has repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war as soon as possible. The draft communique is also expected to reaffirm the G7&apos;s &quot;unwavering commitment&quot; to Ukraine. The escalatory tone comes as Western allies have reportedly accused China of militarily supporting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25, citing European intelligence sources, that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. According to the draft communique, G7 allies will also &quot;continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy, metals and other commodities through the effective implementation of existing measures and further actions against (Russia&apos;s) &#x2018;shadow fleet&#x2019;&quot; &#x2014; referring to Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to evade sanctions on the $60-per-barrel oil price cap imposed two years ago. Earlier on Nov. 25, the United Kingdom sanctioned 30 oil tankers of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that carried billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products last year. Draft communiques are often subject to revision before a final draft is approved. China has repeatedly claimed to have positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war, but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Earlier in July, NATO&apos;s then-Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that allies agreed that Beijing is a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-expected-to-increase-pressure-on-china-over-support-for-russia-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-25T14:20:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152601390.jpg
Record number of Russian attack drones entered Belarus overnight, monitoring group says	A record 38 Russian Shahed-type attack drones entered Belarusian territory overnight on Nov. 24-25, with at least one of the drones reportedly shot down by the Belarusian Air Force, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. The airspace intrusions, which have increased in recent months, comes as Russia continues to intensify its drone attacks against Ukrainian cities. Russia launched a total of 145 drones at Ukrainian targets overnight, with Ukrainian air defenses downing 71 of the attack drones, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. The incident, marking the largest Russian drone incursion into Belarusian airspace since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marks one of the rare occasions when a Belarusian aircraft has downed a drone entering its airspace. Belarus&apos; military confirmed downing a Russian drone over its territory for the first time on Sept. 5. According to Belarusian Hajun, the Belarusian Air Force scrambled fighter jets four times over the past 24 hours to counter the attack drones. The monitoring group reported that the majority of the attack drones passed along Belarus&apos; southern border with Ukraine, particularly in Homel Oblast. Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2013; its key ally &#x2013; over the reported drone incidents. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus hosts Russian troops and missiles on its territory. The attacks come as Russia continues to increase its attacks against civilian targets, amid an expected harsh winter plagued by energy shortages. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 2 that Russia launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October, with the Air Force previously reporting that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. Later in the day on Nov. 25, a Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in Mykolaiv Oblast while humanitarian aid was being distributed there, injuring five people with both aid workers and residents among the victims.	https://kyivindependent.com/record-number-of-russian-attack-drones-entered-belarusian-territory-overnight-monitoring-group-says/	2024-11-25T12:53:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian drones reportedly hit oil depot in Russia's Kaluga Oblast	Key developments on Nov. 25: Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) hit an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 25. The Kaluganefteprodukt oil facility, which is used to support Russian aggression against Ukraine, was struck by drones at 0:30 a.m. on Nov. 25, leading to a fire, the source claimed. The successful attack was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Kaluga, a city of roughly 340,000 people, lies approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Videos shared on local Telegram channels showed a fire and active air defenses in the city. Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha claimed that eight drones were shot down overnight, resulting in a fire at an industrial facility that was later extinguished. The official did not provide further details on possible damage and said there had been no casualties. According to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, drones also targeted Kaluga&apos;s Taifun (Typhoon) factory, which produces radio-electronic equipment, missile and aviation components, and other military supplies. It remains unclear whether the Taifun factory suffered damage, as the target was not mentioned by the HUR source. Ukrainian forces also struck Russian targets in the Bryansk and Kursk oblasts overnight on Nov. 25, the General Staff reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine used U.S.-supplied longe-range ATACMS missile to strike targets inside Russia, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told journalists on Nov. 25. The confirmation by Washington came days after reports that Kyiv launched ATACMS missiles at a military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. The strikes with Western-made missiles were also reported in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Right now, they (Ukrainian soldiers) have the ability to use ATACMS to defend themselves in an immediate-need basis. Understandably, that&apos;s taken place in and around Kursk Oblast,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;We did change the guidance and gave them guidance that they can use them to strike these particular types of targets.&quot; Russia launched an attack against the central part of Kharkiv on the morning of Nov. 25, injuring at least 23 people, officials reported. Thirteen people have been hospitalized, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on his Telegram channel. The victims were at work or walking down the street, Spartak Borysenko, head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office, told the Suspilne broadcaster. The Russian military likely struck a densely populated residential area in central Kharkiv with an S-400 missile, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on his Telegram channel. &quot;(The missile) landed in a yard surrounded by multi-story buildings. Buildings and cars caught fire,&quot; he wrote. According to Borysenko, at least five cars were damaged, while the number of damaged buildings is still being determined. Later in a day, Russia also launched a missile attack against downtown Odesa, injuring at least 11 people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Odesa on Nov. 25, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Brigade liberated Kharkiv Oblast village, took POWsUkraine&#x2019;s Third Assault Brigade said on Nov. 25 that it pushed Russian troops out of the Kopanky village in Kharkiv Oblast, taking several prisoners of war (POW) from Russia&#x2019;s First Tank Army. Russian forces were reportedly pushed out after they attempted to break into Kopanky, a village in eastern Kharkiv Oblast close to the administrative border with Luhansk Oblast. The settlement lies around 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Kupiansk, a key logistics hub under increasing pressure from Russian troops. In a video published by the unit, seven POWs are seen in a basement-like room during a filmed interrogation. According to the unit, the POWs&apos; positions came under artillery fire from the Russian military after their capture. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the unit&#x2019;s claims or where the video was recorded. Ukraine is actively working on developing its own guided aerial bombs, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Anatolii Barhylevych reported on Nov. 24. &quot;We are actively working on it. I think we will achieve such success,&quot; he said on national television. According to Barhylevych, Russia holds the largest stockpile of aerial bombs inherited from the Soviet Union. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles but are far cheaper to produce. When launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, they are beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-43/	2024-11-25T12:48:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-25-203124.png

UN has recorded 376 sexual violence cases related to Russian war against Ukraine	A total of 376 cases of sexual violence have been documented during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported on Nov. 25. The figure includes 262 men, most of whom were tortured in captivity on occupied territories or in Russia, 104 women, as well as children &#x2014; 10 girls and two boys, according to the report. &quot;War-related sexual violence is a violation of international human rights, humanitarian and criminal law,&quot; the mission said. &quot;Preventing this kind of violence and bringing perpetrators to justice is a shared responsibility based on states&apos; human rights obligations.&quot; In April, Ukraine&apos;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told the U.N. Security Council that Russia uses sexual violence as a weapon against civilians and prisoners of war. Citing testimonies from people released from Russian captivity, Kyslytsya said that over 50 percent of detainees suffered torture, rape, or other forms of sexual violence. The Kyiv Independent in June identified two Russian soldiers who were involved in the rape of two women during the occupation of Kyiv and Kherson oblasts in March 2022. Subsequently, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office charged one of them, Mykola Senenko, with raping a woman in Kherson Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-records-over-370-sexual-violence-cases-related-to-russian-war-against-ukraine/	2024-11-25T10:01:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240556838.jpg
Drone coalition to gather $1.8 billion by end of 2024, defense minister says	The international drone coalition is planning to gather 1.8 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by the end of 2024 to support Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Nov. 25. &quot;This decision will allow Ukraine to strengthen its technological advantage on the battlefield and destroy the enemy more effectively,&quot; Umerov said. An allied initiative, co-headed by the U.K. and Latvia, was launched in January to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which became a crucial capability on the battlefield. Nearly 20 countries joined the coalition as of late November. Riga will allocate 20 million euros ($21 million) this year for the effort. Umerov did not specify how much money other countries will allocate to the drone coalition. Ukraine is also working to scale up domestic production, aiming to produce at least 1 million drones in 2024. Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields and logistics, as well as oil refineries and depots.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-coalition-to-allocate-1-8-billion-to-ukraine-by-end-of-2024/	2024-11-25T09:07:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Ukraine 'sees existing threats' from Russia in Zaporizhzhia sector, Zelensky says	Ukraine is tracking threats from Russian troops in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25 following a report by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. &quot;We see the existing threats,&quot; Zelensky said. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, saying Moscow was deploying trained assault groups to front-line positions in mid-November. Russia is also carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, attempting to encircle the latter one. The president described the situation near the town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast as &quot;the most difficult.&quot; &quot;We are working to strengthen our positions,&quot; he added. According to the president, Ukrainian soldiers also continue to hold positions in Kursk Oblast amid an ongoing nearly four-months-long incursion. Last week, Reuters reported that Kyiv had lost over 40% of captured territory in the Russian region due to Moscow&apos;s counterattacks. To aid Moscow&apos;s war effort, North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Our task is to destroy the Russian potential in the border area as much as possible,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-3/	2024-11-25T08:03:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-25_14-22-21.jpg
North Korea expands plant producing missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, Reuters reports	North Korea is expanding a key weapons production complex that assembles KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Nov.25, citing researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) and satellite images. Moscow launched around 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles in 2024, CNN reported last week, citing an unnamed Ukrainian defense official. &#xA0;This accounts for nearly one-third of the 194 ballistic missile strikes tracked by Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force. August and September saw a surge in these attacks, with Ukrainian officials publicly identifying the KN-23 as a significant threat. The facility, known as the February 11 plant, is part of the Ryongsong Machine Complex in Hamhung, the second-largest city in North Korea. The plant was the only known manufacturer of KN-23 missiles, said Sam Lair, a research fellow at the CNS. Previously released videos by North Korean state-controlled media showed that the complex produced everything from tank wheels to rocked motor cases, Lair added. According to October satellite images, an additional assembly building is under construction, as well as a new housing facility that may be intended for workers, the think tank&apos;s analysis showed. The new assembly building is about 60 to 70% the size of the previous one where the missiles were assembled, Reuters reported. The researchers also suggested that the entrances to some of the complex&apos;s underground facilities had been improved. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either country comes under attack. The Russian parliament ratified the defense treaty in October, amid reports that North Korea was sending troops along with weapons to aid Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. Pyongyang has sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia, many of whom are stationed in embattled Kursk Oblast and are engaged in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a Nov. 12 briefing.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-expands-plant-producing-missiles-used-by-russia-against-ukraine-researchers-tell-reuters/	2024-11-25T07:16:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166581785.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Ukraine’s nuclear ambitions fueled by betrayal, hindered by feasibility	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Nov. 23, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. For a brief period just over 30 years ago, Ukraine possessed the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Its missiles could reach targets more than 10,000 kilometers away in just 25 minutes. But in 1994, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the newly independent country gave up all its nuclear weapons. In return, it signed the Budapest Memorandum alongside the United States, Britain, and Russia, which obligated them to provide security assurances. All illusions were shattered when one of the guarantor countries waged war against Ukraine, first in 2014 and then in a full-scale invasion in 2022. The nuclear threat in Ukraine has been rising. On Nov. 20, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the country&apos;s legal threshold for a nuclear strike, allowing the possibility of a nuclear response to a conventional attack. Putin made the change after U.S. President Biden authorized Ukraine to use American-made missiles to strike inside Russia. The fundamental issue behind a potential Ukrainian nuclear program is the sense of betrayal: by Russia, for invading, and by the West, for failing to uphold its security assurances. Ukrainian officials continue to assert that the country has no plans to develop nuclear weapons and prefers a peaceful path. However, a recent poll showed that a majority of Ukrainians support the idea of returning to nuclear status. They see it as a means to deter Russia. If Ukraine is excluded from NATO and U.S. military aid, they believe restoring nuclear capabilities could bolster sovereignty independently. Last week, The Times of London speculated that Ukraine could build a basic nuclear bomb within a few months if the Trump administration stopped providing military aid. The spent nuclear fuel stored at Ukrainian power plants could be used to create a weapon similar to the &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb dropped on Nagasaki during WWII. &quot;Statements about Ukraine&apos;s nuclear capabilities are made either by total ignoramuses or by Russian provocateurs... As a person who worked on this issue continuously in parliament, I can assure you 100% that the Ukrainian government has never raised the issue of using nuclear weapons at any level,&quot; former Ukrainian Minister Yurii Kostenko told The Counteroffensive. Kostenko, the former environment and nuclear safety minister, also led Ukraine&apos;s delegation for nuclear disarmament in the 1990s. After announcing its commitment to nuclear disarmament, Ukraine saw new prospects for its future. In 1992, the U.S. was even prepared to offer NATO membership as a security guarantee. But Moscow had other plans. Under immense Russian pressure, Ukraine didn&#x2019;t destroy its nuclear weapons independently. Instead, it handed them over to the Kremlin for destruction. &quot;From the very first minutes of the negotiation process on Ukraine&apos;s nuclear disarmament, one thing became clear: in the minds of the Russians, the Soviet Union had not collapsed &#x2014; it had merely transformed. Russia, or rather the Kremlin, still saw itself as having the right to control the actions of its former republics, as it had before,&quot; Kostenko recalled. The ex-minister explained that due to the Soviet-era mindset of the Ukrainian government at the time &#x2014; considering Russia as a &#x201C;big brother&#x201D; &#x2014; Kyiv ultimately surrendered over 170 intercontinental missiles, more than 40 strategic bombers, and thousands of nuclear warheads to Russia. It was a fatal mistake. In the 1990s, it was estimated that Ukraine could have restored its nuclear potential in five to seven years. According to Harvard nuclear disarmament expert Mariana Budjeryn, it would take a similar timeframe for Ukraine to rebuild such capabilities now, assuming the war ended and sufficient financial resources were available. However, this is purely theoretical &#x2014; the situation is far more complicated. To develop a nuclear weapon requires two key ingredients: significant financial resources and advanced technology. Today, Ukraine&apos;s economy is largely sustained by foreign aid, and it&#x2019;s clear that Kyiv won&#x2019;t be able to use Western funding to develop nuclear weapons. Finding the necessary funds within its own reserves is also highly unlikely, as other countries typically spend at least a billion dollars annually to maintain their nuclear capabilities. &quot;If you look at the financial capabilities of the Ukrainian state budget, it couldn&apos;t even finance the maintenance of the Ukrainian armed forces&#x2026; even non-nuclear ones,&quot; Kostenko said. U.S. President Bill Clinton (L), Russian President Boris Yeltsin (C), and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk (R) pose for a photo after having signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances.(Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Even if Ukraine could secure the funds to produce nuclear weapons, there remains the technical and engineering challenge. Ukraine has been involved in the production of nuclear weapons in the past. For example, manufacturers based in Ukraine produced one of the first Soviet intercontinental missiles. According to Budjeryn, Kyiv still retains some institutional knowledge of nuclear physics and certain industrial capacities inherited from the Soviet era. But much of this expertise and infrastructure has been lost over time. Ukraine is one of the most nuclear-dependent countries in the world, with nuclear energy accounting for more than half of its electricity production. Currently, there are four nuclear power plants in operation in Ukraine, and another, Chornobyl, has been decommissioned since 1986. Uranium and plutonium can be used to make nuclear fuel. Plutonium almost doesn&#x2019;t exist in nature, and its production requires a special kind of reactor that&#x2019;s not easy to build or conceal. Uranium, on the other hand, is a natural resource, and Ukraine has large reserves of this ore. It was from this material that the first Soviet warheads were produced. However, Ukraine is not a country capable of producing enriched nuclear fuel, even for peaceful purposes. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine bought nuclear fuel from Russia but has since switched to purchasing it entirely from the United States. And this is far from the highly enriched uranium needed for weapons development. Ukraine is a part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If it begins producing nuclear fuel for weapons, the IAEA will likely discover it. Ukraine would then need to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The only country to have done so is North Korea. Since then, it has been one of the most sanctioned countries in the world, which has severely impacted its economy. If Ukraine withdrew from the treaty, it could face a similar fate, the former nuclear safety minister believes. &quot;North Korea has been under sanctions for 12 years, Iran is under sanctions, and Ukraine will be under sanctions. The question is who will bring us shells, missiles, especially for air defense, because every day Russia shells peaceful cities,&quot; Kostenko said. To develop nuclear weapons, Ukraine would need specialized infrastructure it currently lacks. Uranium enrichment requires centrifuges &#x2014; machines that spin at incredibly high speeds to separate isotopes. This is a highly complex and costly process, involving thousands of centrifuges, the distribution of which is strictly regulated worldwide. Uranium can be enriched secretly by moving the production process underground, as Iran has been attempting to do for years. But even if Ukraine were to move all its production underground, it&#x2019;s unlikely the development of nuclear weapons could stay secret for long. Both Russian and Western intelligence services are more active than ever in the country. While Russian intelligence seeks to exploit vulnerabilities in Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses, Western agencies are closely monitoring the course of the war. &quot;The Ukrainian military has still managed to keep operations secret in several instances. The surprise in the Kharkiv region during the counteroffensive and in the Kursk region are examples. It is possible to maintain such secrecy for short periods,&quot; said Budjeryn. Even if Ukraine managed to keep its nuclear production secret, nuclear warheads alone are insufficient. Ukraine would need delivery systems to fire the weapons. Typically, nuclear forces consist of three components &#x2014; ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines, and strategic bombers &#x2014; collectively known as the &#x201C;nuclear triad.&#x201D; At present, Ukraine has no submarines in service, and its bombers have been transferred to Russia. This leaves the only viable option: to develop long-range missiles. &quot;A prototype of a short-range ballistic missile has already been developed, but we have yet to see whether there is any mass production of these systems, or how these systems might be used, for example, in a deterrence strategy with conventional or nuclear warheads,&quot; explained Budjeryn. Even if Ukraine developed these systems, it&#x2019;s unclear that nuclear weapons would guarantee peace. The presence of nuclear weapons hasn&#x2019;t always prevented conflict. For instance, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, yet their conflict has persisted for decades, with nuclear warheads failing to act as a deterrent. Kostenko is convinced that developing nuclear weapons, even if feasible, is a futile idea that would lead nowhere, as Ukraine lacks the capacity to compete with Russia&apos;s nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. &quot;Why do we need nuclear weapons? Even if we were to reach a certain level of production, we would never be able to compete with Russia in terms of nuclear power to protect ourselves from a Russian savage wielding a nuclear club,&quot; the former minister remarked. Ultimately, the idea of a domestic nuclear program is less about policy than a signal to the world. Talk about this issue reflects Ukraine&#x2019;s grief and anger over once having the means to deter war on its land &#x2014; and, after giving it up, being left vulnerable to death and destruction due to promises unkept.

UK targets 30 tankers in its largest sanctions package against Russia's 'shadow fleet'	The United Kingdom sanctioned 30 oil tankers of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that carried billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products last year, the government said on Nov. 25. &quot;Oil revenues are a crucial source of funding for the Kremlin&#x2019;s illegal war in Ukraine,&quot; the Foreign Office said in a statement. The latest sanctions follow Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to evade the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil revenues through the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. &quot;Constraining these revenues, including by cracking down on the companies that insure these vessels, is vital for maintaining our shared security: degrading the Kremlin&#x2019;s war machine, clearing our shipping lanes of unsafe traffic, and protecting our international trade to make room for growth.&#x201D; the statement added. The sanctions expand the number of U.K.-sanctioned Russian vessels to 73, the biggest batch of sanctioned ships by a single Western country. The EU and U.S. have also targeted Russia&apos;s shadow fleet in previous rounds of sanctions, applying restrictions to individual tankers and shipping services. Russia has invested $10 billion to expand its shadow fleet since 2022, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute. The fleet consists of old and poorly insured tankers that carried two-thirds of Russia&apos;s seaborne crude oil exports last year, the report showed.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-targets-30-tankers-in-its-largest-sanctions-package-against-russias-shadow-fleet/	2024-11-25T06:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1477538300.jpg
Ukraine's top energy company to receive $112 million from EU, US to restore facilities	DTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, will receive $112 million from the EU and the U.S. to restore facilities damaged in Russian attacks and prepare them for winter, the company said on Nov. 25. Russian attacks have destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign in the spring and summer earlier this year, which aimed to knock out Ukraine&apos;s power grid. Moscow&apos;s forces launched another massive attack on Nov. 17, again targeting DTEK&apos;s power plants. The U.S. government is providing $46.1 million to purchase control systems and dozens of new transformers, while the European Commission pledged 62.8 million euros ($66 million) to restore 1.8GW of generating capacity and to protect power plant equipment from elements during the winter. &quot;The work will ensure a stable and reliable energy supply to more than 2 million Ukrainians,&quot; the company said in a press release. &quot;The United States is proud to support Ukraine&apos;s energy resilience with this critical aid package,&quot; said Geoffrey Pyatt, the assistant secretary of state for energy resources. &quot;By providing $46.1 million for control systems and new transformers, we are helping to rebuild and fortify Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure against Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked attacks.&quot; DTEK&apos;s CEO, Maksym Timchenko, said the company is &quot;deeply grateful for the unwavering support of the United States and the European Commission, and the leadership of the Ministry of Energy in delivering this vital aid.&quot; In turn, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of Ukraine&apos;s largest institutional investors, said it would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. &quot;The objective of freeing the economy from the influence of oligarchs is absolutely fundamental,&quot; EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said, according to the Italian publication Corriere della Sera. Akhmetov is Ukraine&apos;s wealthiest man, with vast holdings in mining and metallurgy. Formerly a lawmaker of the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the business tycoon saw a large part of his assets lost during Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/dtek-112-million-from-us-eu/	2024-11-25T05:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147953041.jpeg
5 injured by Russian drone during humanitarian aid distribution in Mykolaiv Oblast	A Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in Mykolaiv Oblast while humanitarian aid was being distributed there on Nov. 25, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Five people were injured, with both aid workers and residents among the victims. All of them were taken to hospital, and two are in serious condition, the governor wrote on his Telegram channel. The attack comes five days after Russian forces struck another humanitarian aid distribution point in Novodmytrivka in Kherson Oblast, reportedly targeting a building where volunteers were distributing bread to residents. A projectile struck the roof, damaging windows, the facade, and the roof itself. No injuries were reported in that case. Earlier today, Russian forces also struck houses in central Kharkiv, injuring 23, and also struck downtown Odesa, wounding 11, local authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-injured-by-russian-drone-in-mykolaiv-oblast/	2024-11-25T05:11:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Trump's reelection revives talks in Europe on sending military personnel to Ukraine, Le Monde reports	Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election revived discussion among European allies on sending military personnel or private defense contractors to Ukraine, Le Monde reported on Nov. 25, citing undisclosed sources. The topic was reportedly brought up during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s visit to France on Nov. 11, as London and Paris do not rule out taking the lead in the pro-Kyiv coalition, the outlet writes. There are fears that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russian aggression. French President Emmanuel Macron previously suggested deploying military trainers to Ukraine, but the idea has met strong opposition among several key allies, namely Germany. According to Le Monde, discussions on the deployment of Western troops are still ongoing, but the details remain classified. One proposal reportedly involved allowing the Defense Conseil International (DCI), a 55%-state-held defense contractor, to help train Ukrainian troops directly in Ukraine, as it already does in Poland and France. Talking to the media on Nov. 23, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the West should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-talks-on-troop-in-ukraine/	2024-11-25T04:55:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Opinion: Nuclear escalation fears can't override Ukraine's right to defend itself	Following Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, publicly appealed to those who had voted for both her and Trump. She wanted to know what motivated such an apparently inconsistent choice, and the predominant answer she heard was that she and Trump seemed more sincere, whereas Vice President Kamala Harris came off as too calculating. It was a fruitful exercise, and we can ask the same of leftists who support both the Palestinians and Russia. After all, the latter has been bombing Ukrainian cities until they resemble Gaza, and just as the right-wing parties in Israel&#x2019;s government want to create a Greater Israel, the Kremlin hopes to create a Greater Russia. Russia&#x2019;s eliminationist project should thus remain top of mind whenever we assess developments on the ground. Immediately after the recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to allow Ukraine to launch U.S.-furnished ATACMS missiles (with a range of up to 190 miles, or 305.8 kilometers) into Russia, the Kremlin warned that any use of Western arms against the Russian Federation could trigger a nuclear response under its new nuclear doctrine. Nonetheless, the Ukrainians countered by firing six ATACMS missiles at a military facility in the Bryansk region (adjacent to the Ukrainian border) the next day. Although Russia claims that the damage was negligible &#x2014; five of the missiles were shot down, and there were no casualties &#x2014; following the letter of its new nuclear doctrine would mean that it is now at war with the United States and has the right to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. With some of those around Trump already accusing Biden of taking a dangerous step toward a new world war, is it fair to say that Ukraine went too far? Has it disturbed the fragile balance that kept the conflict limited? Before jumping to this conclusion, one must remember that the U.S. has permitted Ukraine to target locations primarily in Kursk, the border region from which Russia has been launching many of its attacks against Ukrainian positions. As Josep Borrell, the (outgoing) EU foreign-policy chief put it: &#x201C;Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them not only to stop the arrow, but also to be able to hit the archers.&#x201D; Moreover, recall that Russia had escalated its own campaign against Ukraine mere days earlier, blanketing the entire country with drone and missile attacks against civilian energy infrastructure just before the onset of winter. While six Ukrainian missiles caused panic all around the world, Russia&#x2019;s systematic destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure has been normalized &#x2014; much like Israel&#x2019;s razing of northern Gaza.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The situation is as obscene as it is absurd. Russia, having launched a war of conquest against its peaceful neighbor, now wants to keep its own territory out of the war, and it accuses Ukraine, the victim, of &#x201C;expanding&#x201D; the conflict. If Russia is serious about its new nuclear doctrine, let us offer an equally serious counter-doctrine: If an independent country is attacked with non-nuclear forces by a nuclear superpower, its allies have the right &#x2014; even the duty &#x2014; to provide it with nuclear weapons so that it has a chance of deterring an attack. It is often said that Putin wants a return to the Soviet Union and Stalinism; but this is not right. Rather, his regime is sustained by a vision of the pre-1917 imperial era, when czarist Russia&#x2019;s zone of influence encompassed not only Poland but also Finland. Time will tell if Putin&#x2019;s neo-Czarism is more than a pipe dream. In the emerging multipolar world, the rise of strong empires, each with its own zone of influence, is quite conceivable. As Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2022, &#x201C;sovereignty cannot be segmented or fragmented in the 21st century.&#x201D; Upholding political sovereignty and national identity is essential, he said, but so is strengthening everything that &#x201C;determines our country&#x2019;s economic, financial, professional, and technological independence.&#x201D; Clearly, only a new imperial Russia, not Ukraine or Belarus or Finland, will be able to enjoy the full benefits of sovereignty. Making matters worse, on the same day that President Vladimir Putin announced the new Russian nuclear doctrine, the BBC reported that, &#x201C;air pollution in India&#x2019;s capital Delhi has soared to extremely severe levels, choking residents and engulfing the city in thick smog,&#x201D; disrupting air transport, forcing schools to close, and halting construction. &#x201C;And experts warn that the situation could get worse in Delhi in the coming days.&#x201D; While Russia indulges in imperial aggression and rattles its nuclear saber, hundreds of millions of people are finding it harder to breathe. Our media trumpet the use of Western weapons against Russia as front-page &#x201C;breaking news,&#x201D; and our blinkered leftists regard Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; defense as a dangerous escalation. A threat to our very survival, however, barely merits mention. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

MP walks back his statement on number of IDPs returning to occupied territories	Ukrainian lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said that his earlier statement about 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDP) returning to occupied territories was only his assumption, not based on real data, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 25. &quot;There is no such data. This was my unfounded and emotional assumption,&quot; Tkachenko told Ukrinform. &quot;I spoke incorrectly, so I&apos;m taking back my words,&quot; said the lawmaker who serves on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. Tkachenko previously said during an interview with Ukrinform published on Nov. 24 that 150,000 IDPs have already returned to Russian-occupied territories, including 70,000 who have come back to the southern city of Mariupol. Tkachenko now explained that individual IDPs are forced to travel to occupied territories for various reasons, but &quot;it is by no means about hundreds or even tens of thousands, and general verified statistics cannot even theoretically exist.&quot; An estimated 3.7 million IDPs live in Ukraine as Russian aggression and occupation have driven them out of their homes. Many of them face difficulties securing housing and employment. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/tkachenko-idps/	2024-11-25T04:20:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239378487.jpg
You're repeating Russian propaganda,' Ukrainian boxing champion Klitschko responds to Joe Rogan	Ukrainian former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko on Nov. 24 accused Joe Rogan of echoing Russian propaganda after the U.S. podcaster lambasted Washington&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. &quot;You talk about sending American weapons to Ukraine, which you believe will lead to World War III. (Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s Russia is in trouble, so Putin wants to scare you and people like you. His war was supposed to last three days. It lasted three years thanks to the heroism and sacrifice of Ukrainians,&quot; Klitschko said in the video. Rogan, one of the most popular podcasters in the U.S. with over 18 million followers on YouTube, criticized the outgoing Biden administration for allowing Ukraine to strike with Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles deep into Russian territory earlier this month. The podcaster voiced fears that the decision could lead to World War III. &quot;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out. Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&quot; Rogan said in a recent episode. During the electoral campaign, Rogan endorsed Donald Trump, who has criticized military aid to Ukraine and said he would bring both sides to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has sought to speed up military support for Kyiv before Trump takes office in January. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. Fuck you, man. You fucking people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said. In his video, Klitschko asked for an invitation to Rogan&#x2019;s podcast to counter his views on Ukraine and Russia. &quot;If you invite me to your podcasts, we could discuss (our misunderstandings) like free men,&quot; Klitschko said at the end of the video.	https://kyivindependent.com/joe-rogan-klitschko/	2024-11-25T03:43:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2008030057.jpg
Ukraine's 3rd Brigade says it cleared out Kharkiv Oblast village, took ex-convict POWs	Ukraine&#x2019;s Third Assault Brigade said on Nov. 25 that it had cleared out Russian troops from the Kopanky village in Kharkiv Oblast, taking several prisoners of war (POW) from Russia&#x2019;s First Tank Army. Russian forces were reportedly pushed out after they attempted to break into Kopanky, a village in eastern Kharkiv Oblast close to the administrative border with Luhansk Oblast. The settlement lies around 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Kupiansk, a key logistics hub under increasing pressure from Russian troops. In a video published by the unit, seven POWs are seen in a basement-like room during a filmed interrogation. According to the unit, the POWs&apos; positions came under artillery fire from the Russian military after their capture. Russia has been recruiting prisoners for high-risk assault operations in Ukraine to offset its staggering losses during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the unit&#x2019;s claims or where the video was recorded. The Third Separate Assault Brigade is known to have been operating around the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast. They launched a successful counterattack in the region in August, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-3rd-brigade-kopanky/	2024-11-25T03:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1244040441.jpg
Russian attacks in Ukraine injure 5 over past day, including 13-year-old boy	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least five civilians, including a 13-year-old boy, over the past day, regional authorities reported on the morning of Nov. 25. A Russian attack against the Koriukivka district of Chernihiv Oblast on Nov. 24 injured a 28-year-old man, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Three people were injured during Russian attacks on Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Three high-rise buildings and 22 houses were damaged. A Russian drone attack against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight on Nov. 25 injured a 13-year-old boy, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Industrial facilities in the city were attacked. Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Poltava, Zhytomyr, and Odesa oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported. Russia continued to attack Ukraine later during the day on Nov. 25, hitting the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa with missiles and inflicting additional casualties. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 71 of the 145 Russian drones launched overnight, the Air Force said. Seventy-one other drones were &quot;lost&quot; across Ukraine, likely thanks to electronic warfare means, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-106/	2024-11-25T02:46:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Donetsk-Oblast-Nov-25.jpg
UK national reportedly captured by Russia while fighting for Ukraine	A British national fighting for Ukraine has been captured by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, according to multiple reports from Nov. 24. A video of a man in military fatigues, who identifies himself as former British army signalman James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, began circulating on Russian Telegram channels on Nov. 24. In the video, the man &#x2013;&#xA0;who spoke with an English accent &#x2013; says he signed up for Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, a unit made up of foreign volunteers, after serving in the British military from 2019 to 2023. When the footage was taken remains unclear, and its authenticity could not be independently verified. The man cannot speak freely as he was recorded while captured and apparently in the presence of Russian soldiers. The Russian state news agency TASS quoted a military source claiming that a &quot;U.K. mercenary&quot; has been detained in Kursk Oblast, an embattled region on the border with Ukraine. Russia often presents foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The U.K. Foreign Office told the media it was &quot;supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.&quot; Scott Anderson, the 22-year-old&apos;s father, told the Daily Mail that he &quot;was in complete shock and in tears&quot; when the fighter&apos;s commander sent him the video. &quot;I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared, and worried,&quot; Scott Anderson said. Two other Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange. Russia has ramped up pressure in Kursk Oblast to dislodge Ukrainian troops holding positions there since early August. Reuters reported on Nov. 23 that Ukraine had lost over 40% of territory previously captured during the incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-man-reportedly-captured/	2024-11-25T01:57:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg
Russia launches missile attack against Odesa, casualties reported	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a missile attack against the central part of Odesa on Nov. 25, inflicting casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. &quot;Civilian infrastructure was damaged, namely residential buildings,&quot; Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/odesa-attack-nov25/	2024-11-25T00:52:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
Ukrainian drones hit oil depot in western Russia's Kaluga Oblast, source says	Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) hit an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 25. The Kaluganefteprodukt oil facility, which is used to support Russian aggression in Ukraine, was struck by the drones at 0:30 a.m. on Nov. 25, leading to a series of blasts and a fire, the source claimed. Kaluga, a city of roughly 340,000 people, lies approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Videos shared on local Telegram channels show a fire and active air defenses in the city. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show active air defense during a drone attack in Kaluga, Kaluga Oblast, Russia, overnight on Nov. 25, 2024. (HUR source)Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha claimed that eight drones were shot down overnight, resulting in a fire at an industrial facility that was later extinguished. The official did not provide further details on possible damage and said there had been no casualties. According to Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, drones also targeted Kaluga&apos;s Taifun (Typhoon) factory, which produces radio-electronic equipment, missile and aviation components, and other military supplies. It remains unclear whether the Taifun factory suffered damage, as the target was not mentioned by the HUR source. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kaluga-oil-depot/	2024-11-25T00:39:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Kaluga.png
Cargo plane crashes in Lithuania, leaving one dead	A DHL cargo plane flying from Leipzig in Germany crashed near the Vilnius Airport in Lithuania on the morning of Nov. 25, leaving one crew member dead and two injured, local media reported. The plane crashed a few kilometers south of the runway and hit a house, catching on fire. Three remaining people on board survived the crash, and 12 people were evacuated from the damaged house, according to authorities. The Boeing 737-476(SF) plane, operated by a DHL contractor Swiftair, crashed at about 5.30 a.m. local time south of the capital, officials said. Lithuanian authorities said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the crash and that an investigation was underway. Two shipments from Lithuania to Leipzig caught fire earlier this year, with officials reportedly suspecting Moscow of a plot that saw several parcels sent by individuals to catch fire in Germany and the U.K. in July 2024. This could have led the cargo planes to crash if the fires happened during the flight.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-crashes-in-vilnius/	2024-11-24T23:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Vilnius-Airport.jpg
Far-right Ukraine aid critic takes surprise lead in Romanian presidential election	Calin Georgescu, a far-right critic of Romania&apos;s pro-NATO and pro-Ukraine policy, is projected to enter the presidential run-off vote after a shock result in the first round on Nov. 24. Georgescu is leading the polls with 22.92% and roughly 99.9% of the vote counted, followed by center-left Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu at 19.17% and Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union at 19.16%. The surprise outcome signals a possible shift within a country at NATO&apos;s eastern frontier that has been staunchly supportive of its Ukrainian neighbors throughout the full-scale war. Romania&apos;s head of state has a significant influence in some areas, such as foreign policy. George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR Alliance, who has been banned from entering Ukraine over &quot;systematic anti-Ukrainian activities,&quot; is projected to come in fourth with 13.87%. The second round of the vote is scheduled to take place on Dec. 8. Georgescu has previously called for an end to Romania&apos;s support for Ukraine and lambasted the presence of a NATO missile defense station in Romania as a &quot;shame on diplomacy.&quot; Romania took a decisively pro-Ukraine stance under Ciolacu and outgoing President Klaus Iohannis, providing military, humanitarian, and economic support. The country is a key conduit for Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports and has recently provided Ukraine with a Patriot air defense system. Romania shares a 610-kilometer (380-mile) border with Ukraine. Russian drone wreckage has been found on the Romanian side of the border on several occasions following Moscow&apos;s drone strikes against Ukrainian Danube ports, forcing Bucharest to ramp up security measures in the area. Georgescu, who has a strong presence on the TikTok social network, was considered to be a marginal candidate by previous surveys and was often not even listed among the top five presidential hopefuls. He ran as an independent candidate while a former member of the AUR Alliance. Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being criticized by his fellow party members for his overtly pro-Russian and anti-NATO views. He previously lauded Romania&apos;s World War II-era fascist leader, Ion Antonescu, as a national hero. Georgescu served as a special rapporteur in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and has worked as an expert in sustainable development and the environment sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-elections/	2024-11-24T23:02:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Picture1.png

General Staff: Russia has lost 732,350 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 732,350 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 25. This number includes 1,610 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,429 tanks, 19,236 armored fighting vehicles, 29,948 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,787 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,480 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-732-350-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-24T22:37:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Polish farmers lift blockade at Ukraine border	Polish farmers, who staged a protest in the village of Medyka and blocked the Sheghini border crossing with Ukraine, have suspended their blockade, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Customs Service reported on Nov. 24. The protest lasted for just over one day, starting on Nov. 23. The decision followed a meeting with Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Siekierski, during which farmers agreed to submit their demands by Nov. 26, with the minister promising a response by December 10. The blockade had restricted truck traffic from Ukraine, with only one truck per hour permitted from Poland to Ukraine. However, vehicles like buses, cars, humanitarian aid, and military convoys were allowed through. Farmers were protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They were also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. &#x201C;We want to put pressure on the government to prevent this agreement from being reached,&#x201D; said Roman Kondrov, a protest organizer. As of November 24, truck traffic at the crossing has been fully restored, according to Ukraine&apos;s State Customs Service. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-lift-blockade-at-ukraine-border/	2024-11-24T20:46:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Putin signs law prohibiting adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries that permit gender transition	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal, the Russian government&#x2019;s legal information website published on Nov. 23. The law targeted at least 15 countries, including several in Europe, as well as Australia, Argentina, and Canada. Additional legislation approved on the same day prohibits promoting child-free lifestyles and imposes fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000) for spreading such messages, framed as part of a Western agenda to weaken Russia. These moves align with Russia&apos;s broader recent push for &quot;traditional values,&quot; highlighted by past laws banning gender-transition procedures, LGBTQ+ information, and declaring LGBTQ+ activism as &#x2018;extremist.&#x2019; Putin has increasingly criticized Western liberal ideologies, describing them as a threat to Russia. The crackdown on dissent, activists, and independent media in Russia has escalated, especially since the war in Ukraine began in 2022. In November 2023, Russian Supreme Court&apos;s decision to label the &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as &quot;extremist,&quot; has starkly intensified the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in general within the country. This ruling, emerging from a lawsuit by the Justice Ministry accusing the LGBT movement of inciting social and religious discord, has effectively jeopardized all forms of LGBTQ+ rights activism in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-signs-law-prohibiting-adoption-of-russian-children-by-citizens-of-countries-that-permit-gender-transition/	2024-11-24T19:02:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185213511.jpg
Ukraine developing guided aerial bombs domestically, Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff says	Ukraine is actively working on developing its own guided aerial bombs, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Anatolii Barhylevych reported on Nov. 24. &quot;We are actively working on it. I think we will achieve such success,&quot; he said during a telethon on the air of Yedyni Novyny. Barhylevych pointed out that Russia holds the largest stockpile of aerial bombs inherited from the Soviet Union. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles but are far cheaper to produce. When launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, they are beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-developing-guided-aerial-bombs-domestically-chief-of-ukrainian-armed-forces-general-staff-says/	2024-11-24T17:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243505779.jpg
Lithuania delivers new military aid package to Ukraine	Lithuania has delivered another military aid package to Ukraine, Lithuania&#x2019;s Ministry of National Defense reported on Nov. 24.

Solidarity remains steadfast.&#x201D; Additionally, on November 23, the defense ministers of both countries signed a memorandum in Vilnius to establish a mechanism for supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s security. The agreement includes Lithuanian funding for the production of Ukrainian long-range drones.

UK businessman faces no charges after admitting to violating Russia sanctions	U.K. businessman David Crisp will not face criminal charges after he was caught on camera admitting to selling luxury perfume in Russia despite government sanctions, the BBC reported on Nov. 24. Crisp was arrested in 2023 by the U.K. agency responsible for sanctions enforcement, but the investigation was dropped earlier in 2024. There have been no criminal convictions in the U.K. for violating sanctions against Russia since the launch of the full-scale invasion, according to the BBC. A private investigator filmed Crisp confessing that he knowingly ignored trade sanctions in order to sell high-end perfume in Russia. The video, previously only shown in court, was obtained by the BBC. The investigator, posing as a Las Vegas businessman, asked Crisp about his dealings in Russia during a conversation in Dallas in July 2023. &quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone,&quot; Crisp said. &quot;We&apos;re doing really well. ... We ignore government edicts. They said we shouldn&apos;t, weren&apos;t allowed to trade there.&quot; Crisp told the agent that sales in Russia in 2023 were the same as in previous years, but that getting products to Russia &#x2014; including bottles of perfume worth over $1,200 &#x2014; was becoming increasingly challenging. The U.K. imposed sanctions against Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The restricitions specifically include bans on luxury perfume products. Crisp&apos;s former business partner, David Garofalo, hired the undercover investigator after he became suspicious that Crisp was continuing to sell to Russian customers in violation of sanctions. Garofolo described Crisp&apos;s statements in the video as &quot;sickening.&quot; &quot;He had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he&#x2019;d continued selling to Russia,&quot; Garofalo told the BBC. &quot;He had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.&quot; After Crisp&apos;s arrest, Garofolo took over full control of the company and halted all sales to Russia. Despite the evidence against Crisp, which also included company paperwork and international shipping data, the investigation against him was dropped in July 2024. The U.K.&apos;s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) agency said it would take no further action against Crisp. Crisp is alleged to have hidden over $2.1 million in illegal sales to Russia. U.K. lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith criticized the government&apos;s track record on sanctions enforcement. &quot;In terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the U.K. is very poor indeed,&quot; Smith said. &quot;If we don&apos;t prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-businessman-faces-no-charges-after-admitting-to-violating-russia-sanctions/	2024-11-24T13:33:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-502473916.jpg
Russia preparing to break through to southern Donetsk Oblast, military says	Russian forces are preparing to break through to the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 24. Kyiv has been warning of a potential Russian offensive in the south, as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s eastern regions. &quot;The enemy is trying to break through to the south of Donetsk region, where Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts meet,&quot; Voloshyn told Apostrophe TV. Voloshyn said the push would likely concentrate around Velyka Novosilka, one of the largest settlements in the area. Russian troops are also gearing up for assault operations in the direction of Orikhiv and Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. &quot;There is a high probability that the enemy will also launch assault operations, trying to break into our defense,&quot; he said. Russian forces are creating assault groups, transferring ammunition, and conducting aerial reconnaissance with drones, Voloshyn said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. These actions signal preparations for an upcoming offensive. &quot;In addition, the enemy is actively trying to hit the previously scouted areas in these areas... and is finding out where our firepower is located, trying to suppress and destroy it to make it easier for them to conduct assault operations,&quot; he said. Ukrainian forces have been preparing for a Russian push in the south. Voloshyn on Nov. 12 said that Russia could launch a renewed assault on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Ukraine is busy building heavy fortifications near Zaporizhzhia, the military told the Economist on Nov. 24. Earlier in October, Voloshyn said that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russia is currently gaining territory in eastern Ukraine at a rapid rate, seizing towns in Donetsk Oblast at the cost of heavy personnel losses. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. that Ukraine is now facing &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; Russian offensives since the start of the all-out war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-to-break-through-to-southern-donetsk-oblast-military-says/	2024-11-24T12:36:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg
Air defense systems can counter Russia's Oreshnik missile, Zelensky says	There are already air defense systems that can successfully take down missiles like the &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Nov. 24. Russia first launched the weapon in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon.&quot; Zelensky contradicted Putin&apos;s claim on Nov. 24, saying experts were currently analyzing the wreckage of the missile and working with allies to put together a suitable response. &quot;The world has air defense systems capable of countering such threats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Everyone must focus on this. Russia must feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it.&quot; Ukraine is working with international partners &quot;to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation,&quot; he said. Since Putin&apos;s announcement unveiling the Oreshnik missile, experts have called into question his claims regarding the weapon&apos;s novelty. Analysts, including Pentagon officials, have said the missile appears to be based heavily on Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. In the wake of the Dnipro strike, Zelensky on Nov. 22 directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems. Russia&apos;s IRBM attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first reported strike first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Kremlin previously threatened to &quot;respond accordingly&quot; to long-range strikes with American weapons. Zelensky said on Nov. 24 it was crucial for allies to respond swiftly and increase pressure on Russia. &quot;Putin cannot be given a single week to adapt or find countermeasures,&quot; he said. &quot;We must consistently do everything to force Russia into seeking peace &#x2014; true peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/air-defense-systems-can-counter-russias-oreshnik-missile-zelensky-says/	2024-11-24T11:27:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Trump's top security pick calls for end to escalation in Ukraine	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Nov. 24 that escalation between Russia and Ukraine must come to a &quot;responsible end.&quot; Waltz, like Trump, has expressed skepticism about ongoing U.S. military aid to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. As national security adviser, he will play a key role in Trump&apos;s stated plan to bring about a negotiated end to the war. &quot;The President-elect has been very concerned about the escalation and where it&apos;s all going. ... We need to bring this to a responsible end,&quot; Waltz said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 24. &quot;We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.&quot; Waltz&apos;s comments come as outgoing President Joe Biden looks for ways to shore up support for Ukraine ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. In recent days, the Biden administration has made a series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations. These steps including approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. Waltz criticized Biden&apos;s decision to send anti-personnel mines, comparing it to &quot;World War I trench warfare.&quot; Despite this criticism, Waltz said he and his transition team were collaborating with the current administration and that he had met with current U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. &quot;Jake Sullivan and I have had discussions, we&apos;ve met,&quot; Waltz said. &quot;For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other &#x2014; they are wrong.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-top-security-pick-calls-for-end-to-escalation-in-ukraine/	2024-11-24T10:44:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Key developments on Nov. 23-24: Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations, The Telegraph reported. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 . The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defense&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary,&quot; Barrot said. &quot;Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometer, the threat gets one square kilometer closer to Europe.&quot; During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions,&quot; he said. Days before Biden granted approval to use ATACMS in Russia, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Over the past week, Russia has launched over 800 KAB-guided aerial bombs, nearly 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 24. &quot;The air raid siren has sounded almost daily across Ukraine this week. Only last night, our air defense forces managed to shoot down about 50 attack drones,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing a video showing Russian attacks across the country. On the morning of Nov. 21, Russia unveiled a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), dubbed &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack targeting the city of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign, independent state. Yet Russia persists in its attempts to destroy our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us,&quot; Zelensky said. He also reiterated the urgent need for bolstered air defenses. &quot;Ukraine needs more air defense systems, and we are working on this with our partners. It is crucial to strengthen the protection of our sky,&quot; he said. On Nov. 22, Zelensky instructed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international allies to acquire advanced air defense capabilities. The IRBM attack followed Ukraine&#x2019;s reported first successful strike on a military target within Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. Unlike cruise missiles, IRBMs are guided only in the initial phase of launch, making them less precise. However, their exceptional speed &#x2014; often exceeding 3,200 kilometers per hour as they near their targets &#x2014; makes them a formidable threat. Russia has recruited hundreds of mercenaries from Yemen to fight in its war against Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 24. The recruits told the FT they had been promised lucrative jobs, &quot;high salaries,&quot; and even Russian citizenship. However, after arriving in Russia with the help of a Houthi-linked company, they were &quot;forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine,&quot; according to the report. The FT described the operation as a &quot;shadowy trafficking operation,&quot; underscoring the deepening ties between the Kremlin and Yemen&apos;s Iran-backed Houthi militants. Since the start of its full-scale invasion, Moscow has relied on various methods to enlist migrants and foreign nationals to offset its heavy battlefield losses while avoiding full-scale mobilization. Reports indicate that Russia has recruited individuals from Nepal, Somalia, India, Cuba, and other nations. North Korea has also sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia, many of whom are stationed in the western Kursk Oblast and engaged in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a Nov. 12 briefing. In October, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) revealed that Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to target ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles. The targeting information was reportedly provided through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, enabling the Houthis to expand their strikes. This collaboration demonstrates how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to destabilize the Western political and economic order, the WSJ reported. Analysts suggest that Moscow aims to foment unrest from the Middle East to Asia to distract the United States. According to the FT, U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed that Russia is &quot;actively pursuing contacts&quot; with the Houthis, including discussions involving weapons transfers. While Lenderking declined to elaborate, he noted that Russian personnel in Sana&apos;a are facilitating this dialogue. &quot;The kinds of weapons being discussed are very alarming and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and potentially beyond,&quot; Lenderking told the FT.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-kursk-incursion-reuters-reports/	2024-11-24T09:39:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Nov. 24-Nov. 30. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.It is Thanksgiving next week. Expect significant disruptions to the business and political cycles. Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, is expected to travel to the US, aiming to meet with Trump and present an updated victory plan. We believe President-elect Donald Trump has challenged Zelensky&#x2019;s initial victory plan. Expect Yermak&#x2019;s overtures to include proposals on lend-lease terms for further military supplies, on business cooperation and mineral rights for American companies (incl. various sweeteners directed specifically at Elon Musk), and on using Ukrainian troops to replace US forces across Europe. In Romania, the first round of presidential elections, on Nov. 24, is expected to be close. Former far-right football hooligan and founder of the populist Alliance of the Union of Romanians George Simion has surged in the polls to almost 19%. While front-runner Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is expected to comfortably win the first round, splitting of the center-right vote between rival candidates could allow Simion to make it to the final runoff. Montreal&#x2019;s NATO Parliamentary Session ends on Monday, Nov. 25 amidst growing fears of Russian hybrid warfare across Europe. Expect the recent sabotage of key communications cables in the Baltic and Trump&#x2019;s post-inauguration plans to be top of the agenda.

150,000 Ukrainian IDPs have returned to occupied regions, MP says	About 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have already returned to Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said in an interview with the news outlet Ukrinform published Nov. 24. There are nearly 5 million IDPs currently registered in Ukraine, including 3.6 million who fled or were forced from their homes after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the Social Policy Ministery. &quot;About 150,000 internally displaced persons have already returned to the temporarily occupied territories,&quot; said Tkachenko, who serves in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. The figure includes around 70,000 who have returned to the southern city of Mariupol, which was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022 after a months-long siege. Of the approximately 200,000 people who fled Mariupol after the launch of the full-scale war, one third have now returned to the occupied city, Tkachenko said. &quot;According to estimates, this is approximately 67-70,000 people. In my opinion, these are terrible figures,&quot; he said. Inadequate support from the state is part of what prompts people to return to Russian-occupied areas, Tkachenko said. IDPs require more resources and government assistance in order to integrate into new communities. Many IDPs face difficulties securing housing and employment after fleeing their homes. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow, as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 25% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-ukrainian-idps-have-returned-to-occupied-regions-mp-says/	2024-11-24T09:01:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178506540.jpg
Russian troops kill 2 civilian women, injure man in Donetsk Oblast's Toretsk, prosecutors say	Russian troops fatally shot two civilian women and injured a man in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, the regional prosecutor&#x2019;s office reported on Nov. 24. According to the report, at around 6 p.m. on Nov. 21, Russian soldiers entered an apartment in a residential area of Toretsk and &quot;deliberately&quot; opened fire with automatic weapons on three civilians. Two women were killed on the spot, while a man sustained injuries, including fractures to his shoulder and collarbone. An investigation into the incident has been launched, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. Toretsk has emerged as one of the hottest areas in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian forces press their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russian troops of committing over 137,000 war crimes since the start of the full-scale invasion. These include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of civilians in occupied areas, and widespread killings.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-kill-2-civilian-women-injure-man-in-donetsk-oblasts-toretsk-prosecutors-say/	2024-11-24T07:01:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg

Ukraine downs 50 of 73 Russian drones in overnight attack, Air Force says	Ukraine shot down 50 of the 73 drones launched by Russia overnight on Nov. 24, the Air Force reported. Russia reportedly targeted Ukraine with Shahed drones and an unspecified type of drone launched from the Russian oblasts of Oryol and Bryansk. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zhytomyr oblasts, according to the Air Force. There have been no reports of casualties or damage. As of 9 a.m. local time, four Russian drones remained in Ukrainian airspace, with combat operations ongoing. Kyiv authorities reported in the morning that air defense forces shot down more than a dozen drones targeting the capital. &quot;Preliminary reports indicate no damage in the capital, and no information about casualties has been received,&quot; the Kyiv City Military Administration wrote on Telegram. Russia has increased large-scale drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes of the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched overnight. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), reported on Nov. 18 that Russian forces are using cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers produce the Gerbera drone &#x2014; a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed &#x2014; at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. These drones are reportedly made with components from the United States, China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-50-of-73-russian-drones-in-overnight-attack-air-force-says/	2024-11-24T00:20:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 24. This number includes 1,020 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,423 tanks, 19,209 armored fighting vehicles, 29,864 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,765 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,366 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-730-740-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-24T00:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Nearly 22,000 civilians have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast in 6 months, governor says	Nearly 22,000 residents have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast since May, with efforts ongoing to evacuate more residents from settlements near the front line, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Nov. 23. &quot;We are continuing evacuation efforts, bringing both children and adults to safety,&quot; Syniehubov said on air. Kharkiv Oblast has endured constant Russian attacks for over two and a half years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Syniehubov noted that the most targeted areas include the Vovchansk direction in the Chuhuiv district, the Lyptsi area, and the Kupiansk direction. The city of Kupiansk was briefly captured by Russian forces in 2022 before being reclaimed by Ukrainian troops. Its strategic value lies in its position as a key logistics and transportation hub, with several major highways and five railway lines converging within the city. The governor added that evacuees are being provided with humanitarian aid, psychological support, and financial assistance in relatively safe areas, including the city of Kharkiv, located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-22-000-civilians-evacuated-from-kharkiv-oblast-in-6-months-governor-says/	2024-11-23T21:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1973286879.jpg
Taiwan’s former president urges US to prioritize aiding Ukraine over Taiwan, Politico reports	Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen emphasized the importance of U.S. support for Ukraine during the Halifax International Security Forum on Nov. 23, urging Washington to prioritize helping Kyiv despite the rising threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. &quot;They should do whatever they can to help the Ukrainians,&quot; Tsai said, according to a Politico report. &quot;We [Taiwan] still have time.&quot; Tsai&#x2019;s comments came after U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Samuel Paparo acknowledged that aiding Ukraine has begun to strain the U.S. military&#x2019;s capacity to prepare for potential conflict in Asia. Paparo highlighted the depletion of critical weapon stockpiles, including Patriots and air-to-air missiles. During her Halifax appearance, Tsai argued that Ukraine&apos;s success against Russian aggression would serve as a global deterrent. &quot;A Ukrainian victory will serve as the most effective deterrent to future aggression,&quot; she said. Taiwan has increased its defense spending by 80% over the past eight years, reaching $19 billion in 2024. However, Tsai dismissed calls for Taiwan to raise its defense budget to 10% of GDP, a suggestion made by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. &quot;We would have some difficulty accepting an arbitrary figure,&quot; she said, according to Politico. While the Biden administration has consistently defended its ability to balance support for Ukraine and preparations for a conflict with China, Trump allies argue otherwise. Tsai remained cautious about Taiwan&apos;s defense strategy under Trump&#x2019;s presidency, declining to comment on potential major arms purchases in early 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/taiwans-former-president-urges-us-to-prioritize-aiding-ukraine-over-taiwan-politico-reports/	2024-11-23T20:37:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153264373.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of almost 80,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Mediazona, an independent Russian outlet, together with BBC Russia, has confirmed through open-source research the names of 79,819 Russian soldiers killed since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war. As Vladimir Putin boasted the new Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, sparking renewed fears of nuclear escalation, Mediazona reported nearly 2,700 additional Russian military deaths in Ukraine over the past two weeks. The confirmed death toll now includes 17,000 volunteers, 14,500 recruited prisoners, and 9,700 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The Nov. 22 report comes amid growing evidence of widespread violence within Russian military ranks. Recent incidents include the arrests of two commanders, known by the call signs Bely (&quot;White&quot;) and Gvozd (&quot;Nail&quot;), for confining subordinates in dog cages and the death of pro-Kremlin American volunteer Russell Bentley in a military detention facility. Since Russia began its full-scale on Feb. 22, 2022, over 4,364 Russian officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. According to figures released by Kyiv, total Russian losses in Ukraine had exceeded 700,000 as of Nov. 4, marking an increase of 100,000 in just 77 days. The figures do not distinguish between those killed, wounded, missing, or captured, though they are widely understood to encompass all categories. These numbers mostly align with estimates from Western nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-almost-80-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-11-23T18:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
Ukraine faces wave of attacks with North Korean missiles with Western components, CNN reports	Russia has ramped up its use of North Korean ballistic missiles in strikes against Ukraine, with approximately a third of its 2024 attacks involving these weapons, according to Ukrainian military officials and public records analyzed by CNN. The missiles, powered by Western-made components despite international sanctions, highlight a growing collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korea&#x2019;s role in supporting Russia extends beyond weapons, with about 11,000 North Korean soldiers reportedly deployed to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region. In 2024, Russia launched around 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles, accounting for nearly one-third of the 194 ballistic missile strikes tracked by Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force. August and September saw a surge in these attacks, with Ukrainian officials publicly identifying the KN-23 as a significant threat during that period. &quot;Since the spring, Russia has been using ballistic missiles and attack drones much more to strike Ukraine, and less use of cruise missiles,&quot; Yuriy Ihnat, acting head of communications for Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force, told CNN. Ukrainian investigators have uncovered evidence of extensive use of Western components in the KN-23 missiles. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO), nine Western companies, including manufacturers from the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, produced key components for these weapons. &quot;Everything that works to guide the missile, to make it fly, is all foreign components. All the electronics are foreign. There is nothing Korean in it,&quot; Andriy Kulchytskyi, head of the Military Research Laboratory at Kyiv&#x2019;s Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise, told CNN. He noted that the missiles&#x2019; metal casing, which corrodes quickly, appears to be the only Korean-made part. Fragments of the missiles, some produced as recently as 2023, suggest a rapid supply chain funneling components to North Korea. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials estimate that about 70% of these parts are American, with the rest sourced from Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. A U.K.-based investigative group, Conflict Armament Research (CAR), previously found that 75% of components in one early KN-23 missile used against Ukraine came from U.S. companies. Missile strikes involving North Korean weapons have killed at least 28 people and injured 213 in Ukraine this year, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general. &quot;Investigating these missiles isn&#x2019;t easy due to the damage, but we can still identify the vast majority of components as Western-made,&quot; said a Ukrainian defense intelligence official. The exact routes by which components reach North Korea remain unclear, according to weapons-tracing experts, though evidence strongly suggests China as the primary conduit. &quot;We have successfully traced some of those components, and the last known custodians are Chinese companies,&quot; said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an organization that independently tracks diverted weapons. According to Spleeters, Chinese firms acquire the components from manufacturers and pass them through a network of intermediaries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-faces-wave-of-attacks-with-north-korean-missiles-with-western-components-cnn-reports/	2024-11-23T17:32:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185328948.jpg
Zelensky criticizes Brazil, G20 leaders for showing 'weak position on war'	President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Group of 20 (G20) leaders on Nov. 23 following the most recent summit in Brazil, adding that Brazilian President Lula da Silva, the current holder of the G20 Presidency, showed a &quot;weak position&quot; on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. The group, which includes Russia among its members, also includes a number of countries who have contributed to Russia&apos;s economic development throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including China and India. Despite ongoing divisions among G20 nations regarding the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, negotiators managed to reach a consensus on a statement that broadly condemned the human suffering caused by both wars. For the first time since Russia&apos;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the leaders even came together for a group photo. The communiqu&#xE9; acknowledged the toll of the war in Ukraine and advocated for peace, yet stopped short of directly naming Russia. &quot;If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then, we should probably support people first, not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, like today&apos;s modern Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that a lack of a strong, unified condemnation by G20 leaders led Putin to strike Ukraine with new weapons, including Russia&apos;s use of the new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro on Nov. 21. &quot;Without a clear stance from major countries &#x2013; the United States, Brazil, Asian and African states &#x2013; agreements with Putin will amount to mere stalling tactics and further intimidation by Russia,&quot; the Presidential Office wrote in a news release.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-criticizes-brazil-g20-leaders-for-showing-weak-position-on-war/	2024-11-23T15:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1636007322.jpg
Russia damaged over 300 port facilities, 20 foreign vessels in the past year, Zelensky says	Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv. Traveling along the Black Sea route, ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. As a major grain producer, Ukraine exports about 6 million tons of grain per month through ports along the Black Sea. Following an initial blockade at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal last year forcing Kyiv to set up a new export route in the Black Sea. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route. Last month, Russian forces struck a foreign civilian ships in Odesa, killing a 60 year-old Ukrainian port employee and injuring five foreign nationals. &quot;By attacking civilian vessels, Russia tries to weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and put millions around the world at risk of hunger,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on social media following the attack in October. Speaking at the Grain from Ukraine conference during a program that included journalists from 10 different African countries, Zelensky said that the country&apos;s &quot;food exports provide food for 400 million people in 100 countries around the world.&quot; &quot;Food prices in Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and other countries in Africa directly depend on whether farmers and agricultural companies in Ukraine can operate normally,&quot; Zelensky added. Attempting to strengthen ties with African nations amid Russia&apos;s continued influence in the region, Zelensky said that seven of the ten embassies that the country announced it was opening in African nations in December 2022 have already been opened, with an additional three opening in the near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-damaged-over-300-port-facilities-20-foreign-vessels-in-the-past-year-zelensky-says/	2024-11-23T12:36:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243863298.jpg
West should 'not set red lines' on providing military support for Ukraine, French foreign minister says	France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 that Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression. The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Days before the approval, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Barrot&apos;s comments come as EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola, on Nov. 23, also called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine &#x2014; even as Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometre, the threat gets one square kilometre closer to Europe,&quot; Barrot said. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defence&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions.&quot; Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would consider sending French troops to Ukraine in the case of a Russian breakthrough at the front or if Ukraine requested it. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red-line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot; Barrot&apos;s comments comes as Russia continues to intensify its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-should-not-set-red-lines-on-providing-military-support-for-ukraine-french-foreign-minister-says/	2024-11-23T11:22:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2185007597-612x612.jpg
Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Ukraine has lost over 40 per cent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, The Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-russias-kursk-oblast-reuters-reports/	2024-11-23T09:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Russia's Oreshnik missile likely had no explosives and didn't cause much damage, Bild analyst claims	Russia&apos;s Oreshnik missile that targeted Dnipro on Nov. 21 likely carried no explosive charge and did not cause any significate damage, German media outlet Bild reported on Nov. 23, citing Bild military analyst Julian Ropcke. The Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile was likely a modification of Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh missile, he said. Ropcke came to this conclusion by analyzing the available footage of the strike. The RS-26 missile would not contain explosives or a warhead and would have been equipped with a substitute of the same size and weight to simulate the appearance of a nuclear warhead, according to Ropcke. &quot;This demonstrates that it was a propaganda and political action rather than a military one. There was neither a nuclear charge nor explosives inside. That&#x2019;s why the damage is so insignificant,&quot; Ropcke said. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously claimed in an address on Nov. 21 that the Oreshnik missile was a newly designed weapon and that there was &quot;no way&quot; of countering this weapon with air defense. Putin went on to say that the missile could be equipped with a nuclear warhead but that missile launched at Dnipro had been a &quot;test launch&quot; which did not include one.	https://kyivindependent.com/bild-russias-oreshnik-missile-that-targeted-dnipro-was-actually-modified-rubezh-missile/	2024-11-23T09:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Zaluzhnyi: Use of technological advancements will prevent 'serious' front line breakthrough until 2027	Newfound technological advancements during wartime will prevent serious front line breakthroughs along the Ukraine-Russia border until around 2027, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., told Ukrainska Pravda in an interview published on Nov. 23. &quot;When robots began to appear massively on the battlefield, they made any movement of soldiers impossible. The inability to fight robots led to a standstill. We couldn&#x2019;t move forward towards the Russians, and the Russians, accordingly, couldn&#x2019;t move forward either,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. Zaluzhnyi added that this was a temporary period of adaptation and, based on his predictions, by around 2027, the use of such technology could become so commonplace that the potential to achieve serious breakthroughs on the front line would resume. Russia has intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Russia also continues to increase its attacks against civilian targets, amid an expected harsh winter plagued by energy shortages. On Nov. 21, in a show of force, Russia launched a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro. The attack comes as news that Russia has began producing thermobaric drones to target Ukraine, which are capable of causing &quot;simply terrifying&quot; hard to civilian populations, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. Despite the onslaught of attacks and use of new weaponry, Russian troops have sustained record casualties since the start of the full-scale war and have yet to fully breach Ukrainian defenses to seize the entirety of Donetsk Oblast and continue their assault. According to estimates by Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia suffered a staggering 1,420 casualties on Nov. 22. &#xA0; Despite Russia tapping about 11,000 North Korean soldiers to support its attempt to regain territory in Kursk Oblast, questions surrounding their effectiveness remains amid significant language barriers as well as a lack of active combat experience. According to Zaluzhnyi, Russia is not able to expand the front line, as it would require huge resources &quot;which the Russians no longer have.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-technological-advancements-during-wartime-prevent-serious-front-line-breakthrough-until-2027/	2024-11-23T08:43:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
Media: EU parliament speaker calls for sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine	EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola is in favor of Germany sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine in light of Russia&apos;s recent escalatory measures, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Nov. 23. &quot;Yes, that is also the position of the EU Parliament,&quot; Metsola said in an interview, as quoted by FAZ. &quot;There is broad support for this demand. We will see whether there will be a corresponding change of course after the (German) federal election.&quot; Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia earlier in November. A German government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18 that Scholz &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter following news from the U.S. and would &quot;not change his stance anymore.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. However, Germany is set to hold elections in late February, and center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz has conveyed his openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles under certain conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-broad-support-in-eu-parliament-for-germany-to-supply-ukraine-taurus-missiles/	2024-11-23T08:34:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1905669539.jpg
NATO Secretary General Rutte meets with Trump	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on Nov. 23, the military alliance reported. Rutte and Trump discussed a range of security issues facing NATO, according to the press release. No details were immediately available as to the specifics of the discussions. Rutte also reportedly met with U.S. Congressman Mike Waltz, who Trump picked as his national security adviser, as well as other members of Trump&apos;s incoming national security team. &#xA0;Waltz has previously expressed reservation over U.S. military aid for Ukraine, believing Europe should increase its spending. Rutte and Trump&apos;s meeting occurred against the backdrop of concerns that Trump&apos;s second term in office could see diminished support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort or even a lesser role played by the U.S. in the military alliance. In February, Trump stirred up controversy when, on the campaign trail, he said that Russia could do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet NATO&apos;s 2% defense spending criteria. Allies remain cautiously optimistic that Trump will continue supporting Ukraine and NATO, particularly if the efforts are framed as a demonstration of U.S. strength. During a meeting with European leaders in Budapest on Nov. 7, Rutte previously backed Trump&apos;s earlier attempts to get NATO countries to spend more on defense, beyond the current 2% of GDP target. After congratulating Trump on winning the election, Rutte wrote on Nov. 6 on X that &quot;his leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-secretary-mark-rutte-meets-with-trump/	2024-11-23T08:17:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/241123-SG-Trump_rdax_775x440s.jpg
Zelensky marks Holodomor Remembrance Day	President Volodomor Zelensky marked Holodomor Remembrance Day on Nov. 23, honoring the victims of the Soviet man-made famine that killed an estimated three to five million Ukrainians. The Holodomor occurred from 1932 to 1933 under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&apos;s rule. The Ukrainian government has called on the international community to recognize it as a genocide against the Ukrainian people. On Holodomor Remembrance Day, Ukrainians traditionally light a candle at 4 p.m. and place it in their window to honor the memories of those who perished in the famine. &quot;They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed. They wanted to hide the truth and silence the terrible crimes forever. They failed,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;They wanted to confuse us, mislead us, make us doubt&#x2014;to forget, and in forgetting, to forgive. They failed.&quot; Several of Ukraine&apos;s European allies also marked Holodomor Remembrance Day. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola wrote that &quot;Europe joins the people of Ukraine to remember and pay tribute (to the victims).&quot; &quot;Russia continues what it started 91 years ago &#x2013; trying to erase the Ukrainian nation from the Earth. Then via manmade famine, today with rockets, missiles, bombs, murders, rape, attacks on ports, energy facilities,&quot; Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze wrote, noting that Latvia recognized the Holodomor as a genocide in 2008.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-marks-holodomor-remembrance-day/	2024-11-23T07:29:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1801988425.jpg
Bloomberg: Declassified US intelligence memorandum details Russia's suspected targeting of political adversaries abroad	A declassified U.S. intelligence memorandum sheds light on Russia&apos;s suspected assassination attempts of political adversaries abroad, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 23. The intelligence assessment, which Bloomberg obtained through the U.S.&apos;s Freedom of Information Act, details how U.S. intelligence believed in 2016 that suspected Kremlin-ordered assassinations abroad would likely persist. The document includes well-known cases, such as the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB agent who defected to the U.K. Litvinenko accused Putin&apos;s regime of a number of crimes, including that the FSB was allegedly behind the 1999 bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and other Russian cities that were originally blamed on Chechen rebels. Among other things, he also said Putin and his circle had ties to organized crime. Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in 2006 and blamed Putin before his death. British intelligence concluded that Russia likely carried out the assassination, according to the U.S. intelligence memorandum. The document also lists former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, who was poisoned on the campaign trail during the 2004 presidential election, leaving his face temporarily disfigured. It does not purport that Moscow was directly involved in his poisoning but states that his supporters believe Moscow was behind it. Yushchenko, a pro-West politician, barely survived a poising during his election campaign in which he faced pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, backed by Putin. Following the poising, Yushchenko went on to lead the Orange Revolution, a public uprising sparked by mass election fraud that saw Yanukovych being declared the winner. Following a new round of voting Yushchenko won and became Ukraine&apos;s third president only to lose to Yanukovych in the next election. Bloomberg noted that, although the document was dated, it showed that the U.S. believed Moscow&apos;s willingness to target people abroad&#x2014;ranging from Caucasus rebels to intelligence defectors and dissidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-document-about-assassinations-suspected-by-russia/	2024-11-23T06:32:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Media: Polish farmers block Ukrainian border crossing	Polish farmers staged a protest in the village of Medyka on the morning of Nov. 23, blocking the road leading to the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, Polish media outlet RMF24 reported. Farmers are protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They are also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. Only one truck per hour traveling from Poland to Ukraine will be allowed to pass, according to RMF24. Trucks coming from Ukraine are not allowed to pass, but cars, buses, vehicles with humanitarian aid, and military convoys can pass the crossing. The protest is expected to last 48 hours, but if their concerns are not met, they are reportedly ready to protest &quot;around the clock&quot; until the end of the year, RMF24 wrote. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-polish-farmers-stage-protest-at-medyka-shehyni-border-crossing-unrelated-to-ukraine/	2024-11-23T05:20:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Ministry: Lithuania to fund production of Ukrainian long-range drones	Lithuania will fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Nov. 23.

Umerov and his Lithuanian counterpart also reportedly discussed plans to equip Ukrainian brigades, provide ammunition, strengthen air defense, and expand defense industry cooperation between the two countries as &quot;key priorities&quot; for 2025.

Russian forces reportedly advance near 5 settlements in Donetsk Oblast	Russian forces are reportedly advancing near five settlements in Donetsk Oblast, the crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State reported on Nov. 23. The settlement of Velyka Novosilka was targeted directly by a military column of &quot;at least&quot; five armored fighting vehicles, as well as two others through tree lines south of the settlement of Rozdolne, according to Deep State. Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of Rozdolne, but the situation in the area remains &quot;extremely challenging,&quot; Deep State reported. In addition to Velyka Novosilka and Rozdolne, Russian forces are advancing near Maksymivka, Pustynka, and Toretsk, Deep State wrote. Russia has been mounting increasingly intense attacks along multiple areas of the eastern front, attempting to breach Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast and to reach the cities of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-reportedly-advance-near-5-settlements-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-23T02:25:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Ministry: Sweden agrees to finance production of long-range drones for Ukraine	Sweden has agreed to finance the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 22. The announcement came during Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov&apos;s working visit in Sweden and his talks with his Swedish counterpart Pal Jonson. The defense ministers also discussed plans for military aid to Ukraine in 2025, including efforts to equip military units with hardware, which Umerov said are in the &#x201C;final stages&#x201D; of negotiation. &#x201C;For us, this is not just about partnership but also about shared security,&#x201D; Umerov said, as quoted by the Defense Ministry. According to the Defense Ministry, Umerov also met with representatives of Swedish defense companies. Sweden announced a new aid package for Ukraine worth 9 million euros ($9.8 million) in early November, which included two vessels designed to enhance maritime security.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-sweden-agrees-to-finance-production-of-long-range-drones/	2024-11-23T00:57:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/1_467842476_3de048d004.webp

Republican senator, Trump ally rejects idea of negotiating with Putin	U.S. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican and ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said on Nov. 22 that Russia could not be trusted to engage in peace negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine. &#xA0; &quot;As much as I would like to believe we can negotiate with a tyrant, I suspect we may be deceiving ourselves,&quot; Rounds said at the Halifax Security Forum, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rounds&apos; remarks stand in stark contrast to the views expressed by Trump, who has repeatedly pressed for a swift deal to end the war. Trump has also spoken admiringly of Putin on a number of occasions. &quot;Do you believe that this tyrant, if you offer him a part of a free country, do you think he&apos;s gonna stop?&quot; Rounds said, as reported by Politico. &quot;I wish I could say there&#x2019;s an easy way out, there&apos;s not.&quot; While many of Trump&apos;s congressional allies have opposed ongoing military aid to Ukraine, Senate Republicans are generally pro-Ukraine and skeptical of negotiating with Moscow. Rounds went so far as to express frustration that the U.S. has not provided more weapons to Kyiv. &quot;I just feel so frustrated that we have not been able to provide them all of the equipment that they need, and all of the weapons systems that they need, in order to respond to the absolute tyranny coming from Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder why we haven&apos;t done more more quickly than we have.&quot; Rounds did not criticize Trump directly and pointed out that his views were not those of the incoming presidential administration. Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025. His push for speedy negotiations has sparked fears that Washington will pressure Kyiv to accept a deal that favors Moscow, including territorial concessions and a possible promise not to join NATO.	https://kyivindependent.com/republican-senator-trump-ally-rejects-idea-of-negotiating-with-putin/	2024-11-22T21:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850051282.jpg
Whoever enters parliament enters Russia,' Georgian president says	Entering the Georgian parliament following the widely disputed results of Tbilisi&apos;s October parliamentary elections is the same as entering Russia, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said during an interview with local television on Nov. 22. &quot;Whoever enters the parliament today will enter Russia,&quot; she told the Georgian broadcaster Mtavari Arkhi. Zourabichvili has accused the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party of rigging the recent elections and refused to accept the stated results. Along with other opposition party leaders, she has called for public demonstrations and a parliamentary boycott. &quot;I am sure that the parties will not enter the parliament,&quot; she said. According to Zourabichvili, the 2024 elections were defined by fraud on an unprecedented scale. &quot;There was, as always, what I call &apos;normal rigging,&apos; and they make fun of me for it, but the feeling that the elections and the country were stolen from us did not exist,&quot; she said. &quot;The situation is very different. Today, whoever enters the parliament will enter Russia.&quot; Official results of the October election show Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but pro-EU opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. The disputed results triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. Police began dispersing and arresting demonstrators on Nov. 18, though organizers promised to continue protesting. Zourabichvili also insists that if Georgian Dream continues to stand by the allegedly fraudulent election results, they will govern alone. &quot;They are alone,&quot; she said. &quot;They are alone in the parliament, they are alone in the government. The government, the parliament, is one-party, under the vertical of one person, and all the institutions that exist in the country are completely dependent on this one party.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/whoever-enters-parliament-enters-russia-georgian-president-says/	2024-11-22T21:13:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175488096-1.jpg
Crimean Tatar editor goes missing in occupied Crimea	Ediye Muslimova, the editor-in-chief of a Crimean Tatar children&apos;s magazine, disappeared in Russian-occupied Crimea on Nov. 21, according to the NGO Crimean Solidarity. Lutfiye Zudiyeva, a journalist and human rights activist, said Muslimova was seen being put into a white GAZelle vehicle by three unknown men near her home the morning of Nov. 21. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Following Moscow&apos;s illegal annexation, Russia began targeting the peninsula&apos;s indigenous Tatar population, which has been particularly vocal in resisting the occupation. Muslimova&apos;s family became concerned after Muslimova, 61, would not answer or return calls, according to her niece, Elzara. &quot;I started calling &#x2014; she has two phones (a work phone and her regular phone), both phones are turned off,&quot; Elzara Muslimova said. &quot;There is no connection: no Telegram, no WhatsApp, no Viber.&quot; Zudiyeva&apos;s account of an apparent abduction was supported by Zarema Bariieva, manager of the Crimean Tatar Resource Center (CTRC). &quot;Recently, it became known that a 61-year-old woman is being held in the FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) building,&quot; she said in a Facebook post. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports at the time of publication. Muslimova is the daughter of Crimean Tatar activitst Refat Muslimov and editor of the children&apos;s magazine &quot;Armanchyk,&quot; which has been published monthly since 2011. It is reportedly the only glossy children&apos;s magazine in the Crimean Tatar language. According to the CTRC, 70% of all political prisoners in occupied Crimea are Crimean Tatars.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-tatar-editor-goes-missing-in-occupied-crimea/	2024-11-22T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/armanchyk.jpeg
NASAMS air defense systems delivered to Ukraine, Canadian defense minister says	A promised shipment of air defense systems purchased with the assistance of the Canadian government has reached Ukraine, Canada&apos;s Defense Minister Bill Blair announced on Nov. 22. The U.S.-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) were first pledged to Kyiv back in January 2023. While Canada reportedly paid for the system, worth approximately $289 million, later in the spring, its delivery has been delayed. Blair said the NASAMS are now in Ukrainian hands. &quot;This ground-based air defense system will help Ukraine protect itself against destructive air attacks,&quot; Blair said. &quot;Canada&apos;s support for Ukraine is steadfast and we will continue to step up and build on our contributions to Ukraine in their fight against Russia&apos;s invasion.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky previously said on Nov. 4 that Ukraine expected to receive the defense system &quot;by the end of this year.&quot; The NASAMS delivery arrives as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial attacks, including the recently deployed &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), launched against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Following the strike on Dnipro, Zelensky reiterated the importance of advanced Western air defense systems, directing Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to begin new talks with partners on acquiring additional equipment. Ukrainian forces have been using NASAMS systems since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/nasams-air-defense-systems-delivered-to-ukraine-canadian-defense-minister-says/	2024-11-22T18:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2002538371.jpg
Trump may name former intelligence director Richard Grenell as Ukraine peace envoy, Reuters reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s war, Reuters reported on Nov. 22. Fox News previously reported on Nov. 13 that Trump planned to announce a special envoy to take the lead on peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Throughout his campaign, Trump insisted he would negotiate a swift end to Russia&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine if reelected. Grenell is a contender for the new position, four sources close to Trump&apos;s transition plans told Reuters. Grenell served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during Trump&apos;s first presidential term and &#xA0;as acting National Intelligence Director for a period in 2020. He was also appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations from 2019-2021. In July, Grenell told Bloomberg that a path to peace in Ukraine could include the creation of &quot;autonomous zones,&quot; though he did not explain what this would entail. &quot;Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,&quot; he said. Grenell also said he did not think Ukraine should become a member of NATO in the near future. The sources who spoke to Bloomberg said it was still possible Trump could change his mind about establishing the Ukraine envoy position.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-name-former-intelligence-director-richard-grenell-as-ukraine-peace-envoy-reuters-reports/	2024-11-22T17:58:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162458237.jpg
Lukashenko threatens internet blackout during 2025 elections to prevent protests	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has stated that he may completely shut down the internet during the 2025 presidential elections if protests similar to those in 2020 arise, state-run news outlet Belta reported on Nov. 22. &quot;If this [the protests] happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&quot; Lukashenko said, admitting that internet shutdowns during the 2020 protests were carried out with his approval. Speaking at Minsk State Linguistic University, he justified the 2020 internet blackout by claiming it was necessary to protect the country&#x2019;s stability, as protests were allegedly organized online, particularly from abroad. Lukashenko also denied allegations of violence against demonstrators, asserting, &quot;No one was holding down or beating anyone,&quot; despite widespread reports of police brutality during the 2020 protests. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 percent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. His remarks come as Belarus approaches its next presidential election, amid ongoing international scrutiny of his 30-year rule and the repression of dissent.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-threatens-internet-blackout-during-2025-elections-to-prevent-protests/	2024-11-22T16:29:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Ukraine begins talks with partners about advanced air defense systems, following Russia's ICBM strike	President Volodymyr Zelensky has directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems, according to Zelensky&#x2019;s statement on Nov. 22. This initiative is in response to Russia launching a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &#x201C;Oreshnik&#x201D; against Dnipro, east Ukraine, on the morning of Nov. 21. The attack came in the wake of what appeared to be Ukraine&apos;s first successful strike of a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The IRBM missiles are only guided during the initial stages of launch, so they can be less accurate than cruise missiles, but have the advantage of reaching incredibly high speeds &#x2014; sometimes more than 3,200 kilometers per hour &#x2014; as they approach their targets. &quot;The Minister of Defense of Ukraine is already holding meetings with our partners regarding new air defense systems&#x2014;precisely such systems that are capable of protecting lives from new risks,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. He emphasized that Russia&apos;s testing of experimental missiles constitutes an international crime and criticized Moscow for escalating aggression despite global calls for peace. Zelensky promised to share details about the missile attack on Dnipro with international media, so that the full extent is known to global audiences.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-begins-talks-with-partners-about-advanced-air-defense-systems-following-russias-icbm-strike/	2024-11-22T14:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Fwg-DGnWIAkfPD2.jpg
Hungary criticizes US sanctions on Gazprombank as 'threat to energy security', Bloomberg reports	Hungary criticized U.S. sanctions on Gazprombank, stating that they pose a threat to the energy security of Central European countries, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 22. The move is an &#x201C;attack on our sovereignty,&#x201D; Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, speaking at the Istanbul Energy Forum. &#x201C;Hungary is grateful to Turkey, Bulgaria, and Serbia for ensuring a very safe, very reliable, and very stable transit.&#x201D; Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Gazprom and Hungary&apos;s MVM energy company signed a memorandum of understanding on increasing gas supplies at a forum in St. Petersburg on Oct. 10. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-criticizes-us-sanctions-on-gazprombank-as-threat-to-energy-security-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-22T13:22:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
What is Russia's Oreshnik missile, and what happens next?	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 announced his country had launched a new type of missile in an attack on Ukraine, a demonstration of military might meant to deter Kyiv&apos;s allies from further support against his full-scale invasion. &quot;There are currently no ways of countering this weapon. The missiles attack targets at a speed of 10 Mach, that&apos;s 2.5-3 km per second,&quot; he said. &quot;We are ready for any developments. If anyone still doubts this, they shouldn&apos;t. There will always be a response.&quot; Putin said the &quot;new missile&quot; was called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; but analysts and officials have since questioned the novelty of the weapon, as well as how effective it could be to prevent allies&apos; support of Ukraine. According to Putin, Oreshnik, which means &quot;hazel&quot; in English, is a new invention that Western air defense systems would not be able to intercept. The Oreshnik is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead during this attack. &quot;In combat conditions, a test was carried out of one of the latest Russian intermediate-range missile systems. In this case, with a non-nuclear hypersonic version of a ballistic missile,&quot; he said in a live speech on Nov. 21. The Oreshnik described by Putin is so new that barely anything is known about it other than what he claimed during his speech. The reality however, appears to be slightly different. &quot;I&apos;d be extremely shocked if this missile system had more than 10% new parts,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think basically they just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it, and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades, and a new paint job.&quot; The RS-26 Hoffman refers to is the RS-26 Rubezh, of which quite a bit is known. First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a known range of 5,800 kilometers. Its declared but undemonstrated range of 6,000 kilometers would only just nudge it into the category of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Its development and deployment was actually halted in 2018 in favor of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle. The Rubezh is equipped with a MIRV payload, which stands for Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles, which can be seen in videos of the attack on Dnipro. Footage shows multiple projectiles hitting the ground, but without the large explosions normally associated with conventional missiles or payloads, suggesting it was carrying essentially a dummy warhead. On Nov. 22, HUR provided further details of Oreshnik, claiming it is actually just a different name for a previously known missile called &quot;Kedr,&quot; translated as &quot;cedar,&quot; which Russia tested in October 2023 and June 2024. The missile that struck Dnipro was equipped with six warheads, each containing six submunitions, and reached speeds exceeding Mach 11 (around 13,500 kilometers per hour) as it descended, HUR added. &quot;I think it&apos;s really important that we don&apos;t overreact,&quot; Hoffman said, adding the missile itself isn&apos;t anything particularly new despite what Putin said on Nov. 21. &quot;I like his &apos;hypersonic&apos; comment &#x2014; of course he had to put that in, but every medium-range ballistic missile will reach hypersonic velocity at one point, so this is just nothing,&quot; he adds. A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity echoed the sentiment, telling the Kyiv Independent that while &quot;we take all threats against Ukraine seriously, it is important to keep a few key facts in mind.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. &quot;Let me be clear: Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict.&quot; What is potentially new is the global geopolitical situation, the level of tension, and the threats of escalation. The deployment of the missile came shortly after Russia adopted changes to its nuclear deterrence doctrine, which lowered the threshold for a nuclear response. The Kremlin was very clear that the doctrine changes were a signal to the West. &quot;While the doctrine serves as a signal to decision-makers and national security apparatuses, the missile strike is aimed at the general public,&quot; says Matej Kandr&#xED;k, the executive director at the Adapt Institute. Russia has deployed nuclear-capable missiles in Ukraine before, but Oreshnik&apos;s features, like its MRV (multiple reentry vehicle) capability, &quot;invoke the scary, apocalyptic image of nuclear war and therefore allow our imaginations to do a lot of the work for Putin,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia has been employing covert or overt nuclear threats to deter international support for Ukraine since day one of the full-scale invasion. The Kremlin&apos;s &quot;red lines&quot; failed to influence the West from supplying tanks, fighter jets, and long-range missiles. Putin is now attempting to demonstrate strength after U.S. and British missiles struck targets on Russian sovereign territory. &quot;Putin&apos;s problem is that he is running out of ways to convey this message, given all the times that he and other senior Russian officials have warned against certain courses of action&#x2026; and hinted at dire consequences but then confined their escalation of the war to increasingly brutal attacks on Ukraine&apos;s civilian population and infrastructure,&quot; Mathers said. According to Kandrik, Putin&apos;s &quot;ideal outcome would be a prohibition on the use of U.S.-provided deep-strike weapons within its territory and restrictions on future deliveries of such systems.&quot; Mathers also sees it as an attempt to deter broader Western support for Ukraine. Western officials denounced the IRBM launch as an escalation but also made clear that it would not deter their support for Ukraine. &quot;Deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said. The calculus may change after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, as his team is likely to seek a quick settlement to &quot;get out&quot; of the conflict. It remains unclear whether the incoming president, who has often criticized military aid for Ukraine, will keep the long-range strikes policy in place if it could spark further escalatory moves by Russia. &quot;Putin knows that the clock is ticking for both Russia and Ukraine as we get closer to Jan. 20 and Donald Trump&apos;s return to the U.S. presidency,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Therefore, what Putin needs is to convey the impression that Russia is in a commanding position and can continue to fight for as long as it needs to in order to achieve victory.&quot; Experts say, however, that Oreshnik&apos;s launch is not the start of an escalation chain leading to a nuclear apocalypse. &quot;Let&apos;s keep a cool head&#x2026; . We have a mechanism in place. It&apos;s called an escalation ladder with a lot of steps to go through between nuclear saber-rattling or nuclear messaging, which is what&apos;s happening now, and the nuclear first use of preemptive strike,&quot; Mathieu Boul&#xE8;gue, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Russian leadership is not suicidal. The moment they start going a bit too far in nuclear escalation&#x2026; this will be the end for the Russian regime.&quot; Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at CEPA, pointed out that Russia warned the U.S. about the missile&apos;s use in advance and that Iskander and Kinzhal missiles that Russia regularly uses in Ukraine can carry a nuclear warhead as well. Oreshnik&apos;s use &quot;is clearly a political message,&quot; but not one indicating a nuclear escalation, he concludes.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-is-russias-oreshnik-missile-and-what-happens-next/	2024-11-22T12:13:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russian military shoot 5 Ukrainian POWs near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast	Russian troops shot dead five captured Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast in early October, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22. The killing of prisoners of war (POWs) is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a serious international crime. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched an investigation into the killing of Ukrainian soldiers near Vuhledar, from which Ukrainian forces withdrew on Oct. 2. Investigators believe the soldiers were shot dead on the day the Ukrainian army retreated as Russian troops stormed their positions, according to the statement. During one of the attacks, the Russian military captured five unarmed Ukrainian servicemen. &quot;They (the Russian military) killed one of them in a forest belt and took four of them to the road at gunpoint, where they also shot them dead,&quot; the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said. The regional prosecutor&apos;s office earlier reported that in a separate incident the Russian military had shot dead two Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Pokrovsk district in mid-November. They were stripped naked and shot dead, according to the prosecutors. In a picture published by the prosecutors, two blurred naked bodies are seen lying on the ground. Law enforcement officers are currently investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-military-shoot-5-ukrainian-pows-near-vuhledar-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-22T11:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-22-21_48_07.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	Key developments on Nov. 22: The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; IRBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons. Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. Putin denied that the Oreshnik is a modernization of old Soviet systems, as the missile is allegedly based on &quot;the latest Russian developments.&quot; The Russian president added that there are no analogs of such weapons in the world, nor are there any means to intercept them. &quot;Given its striking power, especially in mass use, and combined with other high-precision long-range systems Russia also has, its use against enemy targets will be comparable to strategic weapons. Although the system is not a strategic weapon,&quot; Putin claimed. Russian forces still have a stockpile of these missile systems ready for use, according to Putin. The Russian president also said that Russia will continue to test the Oreshnik missile, including in combat conditions. Putin added that Russia is working on a series of medium- and short-range missiles. Several Russian systems are allegedly being tested and planned for mass production. Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&apos;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, a breach of international sanctions. Pyongyang is subject to a strict cap on oil transfers, imposed by the U.N. Security Council in 2017 after a series of nuclear weapons tests. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Center, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies, such as North Korea, in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict. Nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Suspilne reported on Nov. 22, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Earlier reports from Ukrainian authorities said Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including North Korean soldiers, to attempt to push the Ukrainian military out of its territory. Ukrainian forces will remain in Kursk Oblast as long as &quot;militarily possible,&quot; the source said. According to the source, the General Staff believes that the Russian troops are planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Russian forces have managed to reclaim around half of the territory initially captured by Ukrainian troops. Russia has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale battles. Around 11,000 North Korean soldiers were stationed in Kursk Oblast as of Nov. 4. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive. The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-dnipro-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T11:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2151313411.jpg
Russia plans to launch mass production of Oreshnik missile, Putin says	Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. A day prior, Putin said in an evening address that Russian forces had used the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; to attack the city of Dnipro in Ukraine&apos;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have not yet provided an official report on Russia&apos;s weapon used in the recent attack. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) suggested that this was not a new Russian design but part of Russia&apos;s Kedr missile complex that has been in development since at least 2021.

It was my first revolution' — Ukrainians look back on the Orange Revolution 20 years later	Two weeks before Ukraine&apos;s pivotal 2004 presidential election, 22-year-old filmmaker Iryna Tsilyk found herself at the center of a heated exchange during a trip to Moscow. The upcoming elections were a topic of group conversation and one Russian woman, bristling with anger, demanded, &#x201C;How dare you Ukrainians think you are independent?&#x201D; &#x201C;It was the first time in my life that I realized how much some Russians really hate the idea that we Ukrainians live in an independent country,&#x201D; Tsilyk told the Kyiv Independent. That animosity toward Ukrainian sovereignty would later come to manifest itself in the election results. Pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner over the pro-Western reformer Viktor Yushchenko in the Nov. 21, 2004 runoff, following widespread documented voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Outraged by the stolen election, Tsilyk and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians poured into the streets of Kyiv on the day after the election, demanding justice and a return to democratic principles. The Orange Revolution &#x2014; a two-month wave of peaceful protests, strikes, and sit-ins centered in Kyiv &#x2014; ultimately forced a new vote. Yushchenko triumphed, signaling a victory for Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic aspirations. &#x201C;It was a turning point when Ukrainians, myself included, understood that if we are united, we have the power to bring about positive change in our country,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. Twenty years after the Orange Revolution, as Ukrainians continue to resist Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war of aggression, many are looking back on the anniversary of that uprising as the first battle in their enduring fight for the nation&#x2019;s independence. The 2004 presidential election that sparked the Orange Revolution was perhaps the most heated election in Ukraine&#x2019;s recent history. Sitting President Leonid Kuchma, whose time in office had been overshadowed by a high level of corruption and events like the brutal murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, threw his support behind Yanukovych&#x2019;s candidacy as a continuation of the status quo. A wave of televised political smear campaigns attempting to portray Yushchenko as a fascist, coupled with his shocking poisoning in September 2004, defined the fraught lead-up to the initial vote. For many Ukrainians, all this underscored the high stakes of the election. Six weeks before the election, Yanukovych updated his campaign platform to include proposals for dual citizenship, elevating Russian to the status of a second state language, and rejecting NATO membership. On top of that, Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in Kyiv under the pretense of celebrating the anniversary of Ukraine&#x2019;s Soviet liberation from the Nazis on Oct. 28, but it soon became clear that he had other intentions, as he made a return visit leading up to the runoff vote. People shout during a celebration at Maidan Nezalezhnosti Square (Independence Square) as Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the 50-year-old hero of the &quot;Orange Revolution,&quot; arrives there after an inaugural ceremony in the Parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 23 , 2005. (Yuri Kadobnov /AFP via Getty Images)Supporters of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko in Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 3, 2004. (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Appearing on Ukrainian national television, Putin tried to make it appear that he had no preferred candidate. He talked about how much he liked the Ukrainian language, poorly recited lines from 19th century national poet Taras Shevchenko&#x2019;s pivotal work &#x201C;Kobzar,&#x201D; and told Ukrainians to &#x201C;vote for the candidate they liked.&#x201D; But it was clear that Moscow favored Yanukovych as the next president of Ukraine, and the Yuschenko campaign publicly accused Putin of foreign election interference. In Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest city, English teacher and interpreter Hennadii Tsupin recalled seeing people putting up posters with Yuschenko sporting a Hitler mustache as well as posters of Ukraine divided between East and West. &#x201C;We could also see that the nomenklatura &#x2014; employees of the state &#x2014; were ordered to support Yanukovych. Teachers and doctors, because they are paid by the state budget, were forced to attend meetings in support of Yanukovych. Workers of the state-owned enterprises, too,&#x201D; Tsupin said. When Yuschenko had come earlier in 2004 to visit Kharkiv with the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, some pro-Yanukovych agitators were waving the Russian flag and shouting angrily at Yuschenko supporters. The police had to separate them, and there was &#x201C;a lot of passion and anger in the air.&#x201D; Tsupin didn&apos;t consider himself an active participant in the Orange Revolution when it started, as he remained in Kharkiv, but he did his part to be an informed citizen during the election. He tied an orange ribbon to his Lada, the color of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign. He also went to Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign headquarters and got some campaign stickers to distribute around the city. &#x201C;Because I am 1.90 meters (6 foot 2) I could stick them quite high up on metal posts, out of reach of Yushchenko haters,&#x201D; he recalled. When Yanukovych garnered 39.3% of the vote and Yushchenko 39.8%, the run-off vote was triggered, as presidential candidates needed to secure more than 50% of the vote to win. Journalist Olga Tokariuk was a 19-year-old university student in Kyiv during the 2004 election when she and three of her friends volunteered to work as election observers on behalf of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign during the Nov. 21 runoff vote. When asked where they would prefer to serve, their answer was simple: &quot;Anywhere.&quot; They were sent to Luhansk Oblast, having been told that &quot;nobody wanted to go there.&quot; The group arrived in Stanytsia Luhanska, a town that is under Russian occupation today. Tokariuk recalled how local residents were kind toward the outsiders and engaged in conversation with them in Ukrainian. At the polling station, Tokariuk witnessed firsthand how pro-Yanukovych people were trying to stuff the ballots. Election observers in support of Yanukovych&#x2019;s campaign also forced out pro-Yushchenko observers across numerous polling stations, Tokariuk among them, so they couldn&#x2019;t register any violations. &#x201C;It was really shocking how well-coordinated it all was,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Almost all of our observers were expelled.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of them were even taken to the forests with a sack put over their heads, intimidated, threatened with automatic weapons. Those elections were absolutely not free and transparent. We saw it with our own eyes.&#x201D; Returning from Luhasnk to Kyiv after observing the election fraud and voter intimidation in the runoff, Tokariuk and other election observers discussed their concerns over the experience. Exit polls suggested that Yuschenko had secured 52% of the run-off vote and Yanukovych only 43%, but the next morning, the Central Election Commission declared Yanukovych the winner by 2.5%. &#x201C;We decided that we had to do something,&#x201D; Tokariuk said. &#x201C;We soon learned that a lot of people had the same idea.&#x201D; An estimated 500,000 people gathered in central Kyiv in the days following the election results, many coming from cities across Ukraine to take part in the Orange Revolution. &quot;On the first day after the victory was declared for Yanukovych, I knew that I had to be there,&#x201D; said Khrystia Vengryniuk, who was a 17-year-old university student in the western city of Chernivtsi. Like many of her fellow Ukrainians, she understood that the election results had been rigged. &quot;I told my classmates that all of us needed to be there, not in class, because our future depended on it,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There were a few other like-minded students in my group, and we stood on the central square in Chernivtsi. Later, we traveled to Kyiv to join (other protesters on) the Maidan.&quot; Vengryniuk had only brought her autumn coat with her to Kyiv but she was determined to stand on the central square day and night despite the cold. &#x201C;I had to fight for what I believed in,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It felt like everything in Ukraine would finally be okay, that we were breaking away from Russia for good.&#x201D; Tsilyk and her friends also took part in the Orange Revolution from the very first days. &#x201C;We got creative coordinating orange in our outfits,&#x201D; Tsilyk said, referring to the color of Yushchenko&#x2019;s campaign that later came to symbolize the revolution. The streets of Kyiv were a sea of orange. &#x201C;The entire atmosphere was vibrant and festive &#x2014; people were singing and chanting pro-Yushchenko slogans.&#x201D; Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko surround the parliament building in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 27, 2004. (Uriel Sinai/Getty Images)Despite the frigid weather and the high stakes of the protests, many Ukrainians remember the Orange Revolution as a largely peaceful, even celebratory moment. In stark contrast to the EuroMaidan Revolution, also known as Revolution of Dignity, a decade later, which saw over 100 protesters killed by the security forces of then-President Yanukovych, the Orange Revolution remained remarkably nonviolent. &#x201C;The biggest difference between the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity was that we actually felt safe,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t recall ever feeling a sense of impending danger during that time.&#x201D; Many protesters also looked for ways to use their skills to support the revolution. As a journalism student, Tokariuk helped deliver a newspaper produced three times a day for the demonstrators who had gathered from all over the country. With no social media and few smartphones at the time, providing access to reliable information was essential. &#x201C;I was shouting, &#x2018;Latest news! Latest news!&#x2019; just like how newspapers were delivered in the old days,&#x201D; Tokariuk recalled. &#x201C;It felt incredible to be among the people, seeing how genuine our efforts were and how many had traveled from all over Ukraine to defend their choice (of Yuschenko). It was my first revolution. For many of us, it was our first experience of standing up for democracy.&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 3 that the election results could not be validated due to documented fraud, thereby annulling the results and triggering a second runoff vote. Under the watchful eye of both domestic and international election monitors, Ukrainians returned to the polls for a third time on Dec. 26. The Central Election Committee announced that Yuschenko had earned 51.99% of the vote and Yanukovych 44.20%. Yanukovych&#x2019;s inauguration as president occurred on Jan. 23, 2005, marking the end of the Orange Revolution. Vengryniuk recalled that the crowd was so massive at Yuschenko&#x2019;s inauguration that she began to worry that she would be crushed. Her friend&#x2019;s father helped move her through the swarms of people to a place where she could catch some air. &#x201C;Later, all of us &#x2014; adults and university students who had come together &#x2014; drank wine and pomegranate juice to regain our strength because the crowd had been so overwhelming,&#x201D; she said. Yushchenko would go on to face numerous challenges during his presidency, including infighting with political rivals and interference from powerful oligarchs whose influence he had hoped to subdue. The 2008 global financial crisis further compounded these setbacks in effective policy-making, as well as ongoing gas disputes with Russia, deepening his unpopularity among Ukrainians. During this period, Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions planned their political comeback. &#x201C;Unfortunately, Russian propaganda was incredibly strong back then, and people voted for Yanukovych the next time around. I still believe Yushchenko was a good president, though &#x2014; second only to Petro Poroshenko,&#x201D; Vengryniuk said. Yanukovych won against Yuschenko&#x2019;s prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, and Ukrainians, as Vengryniuk lamented, &#x201C;had no idea what Ukraine would still have to endure in the years to come.&#x201D; Nevertheless, the Orange Revolution served as a crucial moment of political awakening for those involved.

It was really empowering to hear from Ukrainians about their political awakening two decades ago and how that moment of triumph helped them brace for the hard times that would later come.

Ukraine to receive $4.8 billion from World Bank	Ukraine and the World Bank signed a loan agreement worth $4.8 billion, which Kyiv will use for priority budget expenditures, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22, which falls under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) project. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country. The agreement provides for financial assistance from the U.S. and other partners. The U.S. government provides funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and in coordination with the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State. The funds are then transferred to Ukraine&apos;s State Budget within the PEACE project and have gone primarily to the payment of pensions for the elderly, grants to internally displaced persons, and wages for teachers, first responders and emergency services staff. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, about $35.5 billion has already been allocated through the PEACE project to support social expenditures of Ukraine&apos;s State Budget, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-4-8-billion-from-world-bank/	2024-11-22T10:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg

Russia has deployed nearly 60,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, media reports	Nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Suspilne reported on Nov. 22, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Earlier reports from Ukrainian authorities said Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including North Korean soldiers, to attempt to push the Ukrainian military out of its territory. Ukrainian forces will remain in Kursk Oblast as long as &quot;militarily possible,&quot; the source said. According to the source, the General Staff believes that the Russian troops are planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Russian forces have managed to reclaim around half of the territory initially captured by Ukrainian troops. Russia has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale battles. Around 11,000 North Korean soldiers were stationed in Kursk Oblast as of Nov. 4. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-deployed-nearly-60-000-troops-to-kursk-oblast-media-reports-2/	2024-11-22T09:48:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg
Nearly 580,000 Russian troops fighting against Ukraine, military intelligence says	Russia&apos;s ground forces participating in combat against Ukraine amount to almost 580,000 soldiers, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russia has been looking to increase the number of personnel to fight its war against Ukraine. The Russian government&apos;s recently exempted defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army and introduced additional financial rewards for contract service to shore up more manpower. Skibitskyi clarified that the number of Russian troops includes those serving in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as they fight off Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the area, Interfax Ukraine reported. About 60,000 Russian military personnel are currently serving in Kursk, Suspilne reported previously, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Skibitskyi added that a grouping of almost 35,000 Russian Guard troops, also known as Rosgvardia, was also deployed to the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that nearly 700,000 Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine. In October, Russian casualties amounted to 600,000 since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Pentagon estimates. The figure came at a particularly deadly stage of the war for Russian troops. According to reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, September was the second-most lethal month for Russian soldiers since February 2022. As casualties climb, Russian forces continue to press on in eastern Ukraine, focusing on the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-580-000-russian-troops-engaged-in-combat-against-ukraine-military-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; ICBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-against-dnipro-on-nov-21-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:16:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Opinion: Berlin's coalition drama puts Ukraine — and Europe — at risk	Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election has sent political shockwaves across the Atlantic, pushing Germany &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest donor &#x2014; into a decisive moment. The election has intensified internal divides and sparked a reckoning over Germany&#x2019;s role in European security. For years, German leaders deferred tough decisions on Ukraine, relying on U.S. leadership to navigate international crises. But Trump&#x2019;s isolationist rhetoric and unpredictable foreign policy have disrupted that balance, forcing Berlin to confront its priorities. The fallout has already upended Germany&#x2019;s ruling coalition, setting the stage for early elections in February. At the heart of this crisis is a budgetary impasse that exposes deep divisions within Germany&#x2019;s coalition government over how to address economic stagnation, inflation, and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Trump&#x2019;s victory raised urgent questions about Germany&#x2019;s capacity &#x2014; and willingness &#x2014; to lead Europe in the face of Russian aggression. Germany&#x2019;s recent political turmoil stems from a long-standing constitutional constraint: the &#x201C;debt brake,&#x201D; which limits public borrowing. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, part of the country&#x2019;s ruling coalition, pushed for loosening these rules to counter economic stagnation and fund critical programs, including aid for Ukraine. The fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP), the coalition&#x2019;s third component, resisted, insisting on strict adherence to fiscal discipline. While the coalition eventually agreed to breach the debt brake under extraordinary circumstances &#x2014; such as a dramatic escalation in Ukraine &#x2014; Trump&#x2019;s return tipped the scales. His re-election reignited fears of a more isolationist U.S., prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to frame Trump&#x2019;s victory as a &#x201C;fundamental change&#x201D; that demanded increased military and financial commitments to Ukraine. Yet, these proposals met resistance from the FDP, which suggested alternative funding mechanisms, such as using frozen Russian assets. The standoff proved insurmountable, leading to the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. Scholz has consistently emphasized Germany&#x2019;s 30 billion euros ($31.7 billion) in aid to Ukraine, framing the support as vital for both European security and long-term stability. &#x201C;A Russian victory would cost us much more,&#x201D; he asserted in a televised address following the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. However, his actions often fell short of his rhetoric. Over the past two years, Germany&#x2019;s contributions to Ukraine &#x2014; including tanks, air defense systems, and humanitarian aid &#x2014; have been incremental and politically contentious. Key military systems, like Taurus missiles, remain undelivered despite growing calls for stronger support. Public opinion has also shifted. Far-left and far-right voices now question the cost of the war, advocating negotiations with Russia. Parties like the far-left B&#xFC;ndnis Sarah Wagenknecht and the far-right Alternative f&#xFC;r Deutschland (AfD) have gained traction, particularly in economically weaker regions, by appealing to voters frustrated with rising gas prices and prolonged military involvement. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s mainstream parties have struggled to articulate a clear endgame for the war or its broader implications.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s re-election has thrust Germany into an uncomfortable spotlight, forcing it to reassess its reliance on U.S. leadership. For Ukrainians, who have tirelessly campaigned for German military support, this moment feels both urgent and uncertain. Activists continue to demand the delivery of advanced systems, like the Taurus missile, which could change the trajectory of the war. Yet Germany&#x2019;s hesitancy remains, with many decisions still tied to Washington&#x2019;s lead. The upcoming February elections could mark a decisive shift. Conservatives, currently leading in polls, have signaled stronger support for Ukraine, including commitments to deliver more military aid if Russian attacks on civilians persist. However, there&#x2019;s a catch: If the SPD joins the next government as a junior coalition partner, its pacifist leanings could again temper Germany&#x2019;s response at a critical juncture. Even within the SPD, opinions are evolving. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius recently acknowledged that Germany must become &#x201C;ready for war,&#x201D; signaling a potential shift in the party&#x2019;s stance. Yet Scholz&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014; criticized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as &#x201C;opening Pandora&#x2019;s box&#x201D; &#x2014; underscores the precariousness of Germany&#x2019;s position. Trump&#x2019;s return to power has exposed Germany&#x2019;s vulnerabilities and its dependence on American leadership. The collapse of its coalition government is both a symptom and a consequence of these pressures, as economic, political, and geopolitical challenges collide. Germany now faces a stark choice: step into a leadership role in supporting Ukraine or remain reactive, paralyzed by internal divisions and external unpredictability. The February elections will be pivotal in determining Germany&#x2019;s future course. While a conservative-led government could bring renewed vigor to Ukraine&#x2019;s cause, the specter of continued SPD influence looms large. For Europe, this moment demands bold action and a departure from past hesitations. For Germany, it&#x2019;s an opportunity to define its legacy &#x2014; not as a reluctant actor, but as a leader shaping a new chapter for Ukraine and Europe.

Opinion: With soaring interest rates and stagflation risks, Russia will face deep economic crisis regardless of war’s outcome	The recent hike in Russia&#x2019;s key interest rate to 21% by the Central Bank in late October has stirred renewed debate among media and economists about the Russian economy&#x2019;s outlook and how economic trends could influence Kremlin policies. Today, few predict an &quot;imminent collapse&quot; of the Russian economy. However, signs of deteriorating trends and economic challenges confront Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime with a dilemma: continuing the aggressive war or quickly ending it are both likely to lead to an economic crisis. Observers point out several unique features of the Russian economy that cast doubt on claims of its &quot;sustainable development&quot; and &quot;prosperity.&quot; First, the current key rate is more than double the official annual inflation rate, resulting in a double-digit real interest rate &#x2014; an unusual scenario. This could suggest that actual inflation is much higher than official reports indicate and that inflation expectations among the public and businesses exceed the Russian Central Bank&apos;s estimates (over 13%). Even if official inflation figures aren&#x2019;t distorted, the calculation methods don&#x2019;t account for changes in the consumer basket due to sanctions, such as the replacement of Western goods with cheaper Chinese alternatives. Second, despite the high interest rate, loan volume continues to grow, as noted by Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Bank of Russia &#x2014; a concern for the central bank. Credit growth is currently driven by increased business lending, while consumer lending has declined in response to high rates and the end of the subsidized &#x201C;preferential&#x201D; mortgage program in summer 2024. Commercial lending rates have risen to 25&#x2013;30% and above, signaling heightened inflation expectations, a shortage of working capital due to increased sanctions-related costs, and labor shortages. These factors create significant risks of defaults and bankruptcies. Third, the planned increase in budget spending for 2025 significantly exceeds even optimistic GDP growth projections. The Russian government has forecast real GDP growth at 2.5% for 2025. However, even Russian analysts suggest growth will likely not exceed 2%, and the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its 2025 forecast to 1.3%. Meanwhile, planned federal expenditures are set to rise by nearly 12% (from 37.2 trillion rubles in 2024 to 41.5 trillion in 2025). Direct military spending for 2025 is expected to reach an unprecedented 13.5 trillion rubles (about $140 billion). Even within Russia, economists doubt that the government&#x2019;s projected budget deficit of under 1% of GDP is realistic. This is reflected in declining liquid assets in the so-called &quot;National Wealth Fund,&quot; which, as of summer 2024, stood at just over $55 billion &#x2014; less than half of what it was at the start of the full scale war in 2022. The revival of the Russian economy in 2023&#x2013;24 is attributed to two main factors: stable oil and gas revenues and significant growth in war-related government spending. Despite sanctions, Russia has found new markets (mainly China and India), and has employed a &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; and other strategies to evade sanctions. However, both the Russian Central Bank and the Russian parliament are now warning of stagflation (recession combined with high inflation). Resources are dwindling, fiscal stimuli are no longer effective, supply-side constraints (labor shortages and lack of access to technology and modern equipment) are intensifying, and production cannot keep up with demand, driving inflation. This trajectory will likely lead to a severe economic crisis; the only question is when. Ending the war also carries significant risks for the Russian economy. Exiting the &quot;Keynesian trap&quot; of increased budget expenditures will be painful, as a decrease in aggregate demand could worsen stagflation tendencies and trigger a major downturn and crisis.

(Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Over the course of the war, a significant &#x201C;war party&#x201D; has formed in Russia, involving both elites and ordinary citizens. Officials have gained new avenues for corrupt enrichment through sanctions circumvention schemes, while businesses have filled market gaps left by Western companies. Families of soldiers or those working directly or indirectly for the military-industrial complex are earning incomes they couldn&#x2019;t have imagined pre-war. By various estimates, direct war beneficiaries include 15 million people or more, comprising over 10% of the Russian population. Additionally, increased payouts in the contract army and military-adjacent sectors, coupled with an obvious labor shortage, have driven up wages in other parts of the economy. Though public opinion polls indicate broad support for the war, it&#x2019;s evident that the conflict has allowed a sizable portion of the population to escape the &quot;poverty trap.&quot; A return to pre-war conditions and the end of war-related expenditures will inevitably trigger an economic crisis and heightened social tension. By launching the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian regime set itself up for a dilemma in which both continuing and ending the war will almost certainly lead to an economic &#x2014; and possibly political &#x2014; crisis. Given this, it seems prudent for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to make Russia&#x2019;s continued aggression significantly more painful. Enhancing sanctions to meaningfully reduce Russia&#x2019;s export revenues and restricting imports of critical technologies and equipment would serve this goal. The problem is not that sanctions &#x201C;don&#x2019;t work&#x201D; but that they&#x2019;ve been applied slowly and inconsistently, with enforcement often lacking. Sometimes, sanctions inadvertently benefit Russia; for example, capital outflow restrictions have consolidated capital domestically, providing Putin&#x2019;s regime with additional resources. A better approach would be to encourage the maximum outflow of capital &#x2014; including financial and human resources &#x2014; by avoiding restrictions on emigration opportunities for Russians opposing the regime. By intensifying sanctions and closing enforcement loopholes, the prospects for Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;celebration&#x201D; of a prolonged, low-cost war will be sharply reduced, far below the five years or more predicted by a recent analysis in The Economist.

War in Ukraine at 'decisive stage,' risk of 'global conflict,' Poland's Tusk says	The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (ICBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-in-ukraine-at-decisive-stage-risk-of-global-conflict-polands-tusk-says/	2024-11-22T06:48:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
Belarus Weekly: New Russian military doctrine to cover Belarus with nuclear umbrella	Belarus&#x2019; authorities are on full alert ahead of upcoming presidential elections in January 2025, new wave of police raids target relatives of political prisoners. Belarusian police conduct counter-protest drills to prevent &#x201C;manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; during the election campaign. Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine was updated, covering Belarus with a Russian nuclear umbrella. No change in the U.S. nuclear posture. Polish broadcaster TVP appoints new leadership to flagship Belarusian-language channel Belsat amid heated debate over the channel&apos;s independence and future. Record 49 Russian Shahed-type drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October, Belarusian Hajun monitoring group reports. The Belarusian authorities have launched another wave of raids and arrests across the country ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, targeting political prisoners&#x2019; relatives, human rights activists reported on Nov. 15. Since the previous presidential elections in 2020, which sparked nationwide protests, over 3,500 individuals have been recognized as political prisoners by human rights organizations. Nearly 1,300 of them remain behind bars. Over the four-year-long crackdown on dissent in Belarus, 65,000 people have been subjected to politically motivated persecution. Belarus&#x2019;s KGB security agency unleashed a new round of raids on Nov. 14, targeting the relatives of political prisoners in the country&#x2019;s Hrodna and Brest regions, and in the capital Minsk, according to reports by human rights groups Viasna, Dissidentby, and the &#x201C;Country to Live In&#x201D; foundation. The raids constitute the third attack in a &#x201C;terror campaign&#x201D; this autumn, potentially targeting several hundred people, says Andrei Stryzhak, the head of Solidarity Foundation BYSOL, a group helping to evacuate dissidents from Belarus and assisting those suffering from persecution in the country. The activist said the raids were occurring against the backdrop of an &#x201C;imaginary thaw&#x201D; in relations between the regime and its opponents, coinciding with the release of 31 political prisoners and the permitting by the authorities of a family visit to Maria Kalesnikava, a prominent opposition leader who had been held incommunicado for over 600 days. According to BYSOL&#x2019;s leader, this round of repression has hit the northern Belarusian regions of Polatsk and Navapolatsk. With the rapid approach of the presidential election, to be held ahead of schedule on Jan. 26, 2025, the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has launched a &#x201C;pre-election intimidation campaign,&#x201D; human rights activists from the Viasna Center report. Belarusian police are to conduct exercises in Minsk and regional centers to ensure &#x201C;the prevention of manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; ahead of the January presidential elections, the Interior Ministry announced on Nov. 19. The 2025 Belarusian presidential elections, scheduled for Jan. 26, are intended to extend the rule of the country&#x2019;s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, for a seventh consecutive term in office. The previous presidential race sparked protests nationwide after the pro-Lukashenko Central Elections Committee announced his victory amid widespread claims of vote rigging. The police drills, which were scheduled to take place between Nov. 19 and 22, were to &#x201C;demonstrate the readiness&#x201D; of the police to respond to possible &#x201C;complications of the situation in the country during the election campaign.&#x201D; The exercises involve practicing street closures, and using smoke, flash and gas bombs and special equipment to disperse protests. &#x201C;The goal (of the exercises) ... is to prevent manifestations of extremism and terrorism, the involvement of citizens in illegal actions, and the suppression of violations of public order,&#x201D; the Interior Ministry said in a post on its official Telegram channel. A video accompanying the post shows the detention of alleged offenders, scenes from a polling station, and shots of riot police countering groups of people with placards. Belarus Security Council Secretary Alexander Volfovich said the exercises were routine ones, but claimed that exiled opponents of the Lukashenko regime &#x201C;are using all levers and opportunities to try to sway the situation again.&#x201D; Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader who claimed to have beaten Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, said the exercises were intended to intimidate the opposition. &#x201C;Training to suppress citizens isn&#x2019;t a sign of strength &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a sign of fear,&#x201D; she wrote on X. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, providing for nuclear retaliation in the case of armed aggression against Belarus, according to a presidential decree published on the government website on Nov. 19. The revised deterrence policy suggests that &#x201C;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&#x201D; could trigger a nuclear response. The updated doctrine also considers any large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones to be grounds for consideration of a nuclear strike. The publication of the doctrine comes on the heels of the United States giving Ukraine permission to strike targets in Russia with the U.S.-supplied long-range missiles. The White House National Security Council said that Russia&#x2019;s lowered threshold for nuclear retaliation did not come as a surprise, but also provided no reason for the United States to adjust its own nuclear posture. Putin first proposed making changes to the doctrine on Sept. 25 amid discussions in the United States and the U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of the Kremlin, welcomed the inclusion of Belarus under Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella, saying it was &#x201C;long overdue.&#x201D; &#x201C;An attack on Belarus is World War III,&#x201D; Lukashenko said on Sept. 27, alleging NATO countries were deploying troops at the border with Belarus. Although a non-nuclear state, Belarus reportedly has Russian nuclear weapons deployed on its territory following the signing of the agreement on May 25, 2023 on placing Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Lukashenko also attended Russian nuclear military drills, during a sudden inspection of the country&#x2019;s tactical nuclear weapons launchers in May 2024. Forty-nine Russian Shahed-type combat drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October &#x2014; the highest number recorded in a month, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project wrote. Russian Shahed-type drones began to cross regularly into Belarus in July this year, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. Amid intensified attacks against Ukraine in subsequent months, incursions of Russian drones into Belarus surged from infrequent, isolated instances to 27 stray drones being spotted over Belarus in September. Throughout October, 33 stray drones returned from Belarus to Ukrainian territory, while the location of 14 was lost, according to the monitoring group. One drone crashed in Kalinkavichy, roughly 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, overnight on Oct. 3, after three Shahed drones flew into Belarusian airspace. Lukashenko was traveling by helicopter over the country at the time of the drone incursion. Another UAV was downed by the Belarusian Air Force over the country&#x2019;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20. It was the second instance of the Belarusian military downing a Russian UAV since the incursions began. &#x201C;At the moment, there is no reason to believe that Russian UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type will stop flying into Belarus in the near future,&#x201D; Belarusian Hajun said in its report. Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Minsk, Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, has never publicly raised objections with Moscow over the reported drone incidents. Polish Public Broadcaster TVP has appointed new leadership to its flagship broadcaster for Belarus, Belsat, in a move to integrate the exiled Belarusian-language television channel into its Center for Foreign Language Programs &#x2013; despite calls for Belsat&#x2019;s operations to remain independent. On Nov. 15, TVP appointed Alina Koushyk, a former anchor and producer at Belsat, as the head of the Belarusian editorial office. Koushyk, who had left Belsat two years ago for a role in Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s shadow cabinet, said, &#x201C;We aimed to advocate for Belsat to remain an independent channel, but unfortunately, our efforts did not succeed.&#x201D; The merger comes amid broader restructuring of Poland&#x2019;s state media following the defeat of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party in the 2023 parliamentary elections, with the new government saying it was seeking to &#x201C;restore impartiality&#x201D; to TVP. The restructuring implies Belsat&#x2019;s formerly separate airtime will be split into three sections &#x2013; six hours each for Belarusian-language programming, the Russia-focused news channel Vot Tak, and a Ukrainian-language broadcaster that has yet to be formed. Koushyk replaces Aleksy Dzikawicki, a co-founder and acting director of Belsat, who on Nov. 19 requested that his contract be terminated. Dzikawicki said he had requested early dismissal to avoid having to carry out an order to formally liquidate Belsat as an independent entity within TVP. Belsat started broadcasting in 2007 as the first Belarusian-language TV channel, offering coverage in the Belarusian language, which has been gradually excluded from Belarusian public life by the Lukashenko regime. Belarus is low in the press freedom rating, ranking 157th among 180 countries in 2023. Almost no independent media are left in Belarus due to the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s efforts to stamp out a free press, which have seen 40 media professionals prosecuted, outlets being branded as &#x201C;extremist,&#x201D; and punishments introduced for sharing &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; content. The potential downsizing of Belsat to only one of several editorial offices within the Center for Foreign Language Programs has drawn criticism from Belarusian opposition leaders. However, TVP World director and editor-in-chief Micha&#x142; Broniatowski has denied that Belsat will lose its independence after the merger, saying &#x201C;Belsat&#x2019;s editorial office will be fully Belarusian, there will be no &#x2018;orders&#x2019; to cover what the Foreign Ministry wants, or not to cover what it does not want covered.&#x201D; In March, Belsat, lost 47% of its total financing from the Foreign Ministry and Poland&#x2019;s TVP, and its longtime director, Agnieszka Romaszewska-Guzy, was dismissed. The International Press Institute (IPI) has urged Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry to reconsider the decision, warning of the &#x201C;disastrous impact&#x201D; on the accessibility of independent Belarusian news. While acknowledging Poland&#x2019;s financial burden, the IPI called for measures to ensure Belsat&#x2019;s survival as a vital platform for European security. The restructuring is set to be finalized on March 1, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-new-russian-military-doctrine-to-cover-belarus-with-nuclear-umbrella/	2024-11-22T04:46:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1798032839.jpg
North Korea received anti-aircraft missiles, oil from Russia in exchange for troops, reports say	Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&#x2019;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies such as North Korea in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-received-anti-aircraft-missiles-oil-from-russia-in-exchange-for-troops-reports-say/	2024-11-22T03:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
Shahed drones that hit Sumy equipped with shrapnel munitions, regional governor says	Russian Shahed-type drones that attacked Sumy overnight were equipped with shrapnel munitions, Regional Governor Volodymyr Artiukh reported on Nov. 22. Russia struck a residential area in the city killing two people and injuring 12, according to local officials. &quot;These weapons are used to kill people. Not to destroy structures, just to kill more people,&quot; Artiukh said in a video uploaded to the Sumy Regional Military Administration&apos;s Telegram channel. &quot;Just as the previous missile strike [had] cluster munitions, today again drones [are] equipped with shrapnel,&quot; he added. &quot;The same goes for other strikes, in other places where private homes were hit, people were injured and killed. This is pure genocide.&quot; The Sumy regional prosecutor&apos;s office is conducting a pre-trial investigation into potential &quot;war crimes resulting in the deaths of people.&quot; Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/shahed-drones-that-hit-sumy-equipped-with-shrapnel-munitions-regional-governor-says/	2024-11-22T02:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12_24_00.png
White House sees no indication of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine	The Biden administration has not seen any &quot;indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine,&quot; &#xA0;White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre said on Nov. 21. Speaking at a press briefing, Jean-Pierre also said the administration was &quot;not surprised by Russia&apos;s announcement that it would update its nuclear doctrine,&quot; and they believed it was &quot;irresponsible rhetoric.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the country&apos;s new nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric that we continue to hear from Russia, which we have seen for more than two years now, if you think about their aggression, their war against Ukraine,&quot; Jean-Pierre said. &quot;We haven&#x2019;t seen any indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. &#xA0;We just have not seen that. &quot;And observing no changes to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear posture, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia&#x2019;s statements.&quot; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Nov. 20 also dismissed Russia&#x2019;s rhetoric surrounding its nuclear policy as a continuation of its behavior over the past two years. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has made a series of nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West, none of which have materialized.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-sees-no-indication-of-russia-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/	2024-11-22T02:00:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2036341931.jpg
Russia's experimental weapons 'will not change the course of the war,’ NATO says	Russia&apos;s use of a purported new ballistic missile &quot;will not change the course of the conflict, or deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said on Nov. 21. Dakhlallah&apos;s comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro in eastern Ukraine earlier that day. &quot;The Russian attack on Dnipro on Thursday is yet another example of Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities,&quot; Dakhlallah said in comments reported by the Guardian and AFP. Putin said the attack was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russian oblasts using Western-supplied long-range missiles. On Nov. 17 U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. On Nov. 19, Ukraine launched ATACMS missiles for the first time in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, and on Nov. 20, it made its first use of UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. After depicting such a move as crossing another &quot;red line&quot; the Kremlin had drawn, Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said his country would respond. &quot;They probably considered testing a nuclear warhead, which was also rumored to happen soon, but decided that&apos;s too intense, and that could invite too much backlash, especially from partners, such as China and India,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They probably thought that (the IRBM strike) is the next best option because it sends a clear signal to the West, while potentially not antagonizing critical international partners,&quot; he added. &quot;So this strike is not for military value, this is purely, purely for political purposes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-experimental-weapons-will-not-change-the-course-of-the-war-nato-says/	2024-11-22T01:31:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185213511.jpg
Ukrainian parliament meeting canceled due to credible threat of Russian strike in Kyiv, source confirms	A Ukrainian parliament meeting scheduled for Nov. 22 has been canceled due to the credible threat of a targeted Russian strike on government buildings in Kyiv, a Ukrainian lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent. Lawmakers were planning to hold an hour-long Q&amp;A session at the Verkhovna Rada, the source added. An air raid alert was on in Kyiv and several central and eastern oblasts in the late morning of Nov. 22 due to a reported drone threat. The development comes amid escalating tensions in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-meeting-canceled-due-to-threat-of-russian-strike-source-confirms/	2024-11-22T00:59:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
