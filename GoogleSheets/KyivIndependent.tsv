UK to provide Ukraine with $2.9 billion military loan, to be repaid with proceeds from frozen Russian assets	London will provide Ukraine with a loan worth &#xA3;2.26 billion ($2.9 billion) backed by profits from frozen Russian assets, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The funds are the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the Group of Seven (G7)&apos;s initiative to provide Kyiv with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year, which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. The U.K.&apos;s loan will be allocated to Ukraine&apos;s military spendings. Kyiv will be able to invest in key equipment to fight Russia, such as artillery, air defense, and wider equipment support, the statement read. &quot;This new money is in Britain&#x2019;s national interest because the front line of our defense &#x2014; the defense of our democracy and shared values &#x2014; is in the Ukrainian trenches,&quot; said Rachel Reeves, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer. &quot;A safe and secure Ukraine is a safe and secure United Kingdom.&quot; British Defense Minister John Healey said the money could be used to help Kyiv develop long-range drones capable of travelling further than some missiles. The aid comes on top of the UK&apos;s existing 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) a year assistance for Ukraine. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the EU devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-ukraine-with-2-9-billion-loan-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-22T02:18:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179782562.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 10, injure 42 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed 10 people and injured 42 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 22. Ukrainian forces downed 46 out of 60 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ten more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; three others flew back towards Russia and one drone entered Belarusian airspace, it added. Houses came under attack in the city of Sumy. Three people, including a child, were killed, and one more person suffered injuries, according to local authorities. A Russian missile attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed three people and injured 19, including an eight-year-old girl, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russian forces carried out another missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, injuring six people, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

Seoul considering sending military personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops, Yonhap reports	South Korea is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops that Russia may involve in its full-scale war, Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22, citing an unnamed government source. &quot;There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&quot; the source said. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. If deployed, a South Korean team may include military personnel from intelligence units who will be able to analyze Pyongyang&apos;s warfare tactics or participate in the interrogations of captured North Koreans. The government is also reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. The source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly. While the U.S. has been cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-considering-sending-military-personnel-to-ukraine-to/	2024-10-22T00:48:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167507180.jpg
Ukrainian drones target Russian alcohol plants overnight, local authorities claim	Ukrainian drones attacked four plants in Tula, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts in Russia overnight on Oct. 22, Russian local authorities claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses destroyed 11 drones over Bryansk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, two over Kursk Oblast, one over Tula Oblast, and one over Orel Oblast. In Tambov Oblast, a Ukrainian drone reportedly set to fire the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo, according to Governor Maxim Egorov. According to the Biokhim website, it produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol, a solvent which is used in the manufacture of a wide range of products including explosives. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast overnight, Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed a drone attack caused a minor fire on one of the floors of an industrial enterprise. No casualties have reported. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-4-plants-in-russia-overnight-local-authorities-claim/	2024-10-21T23:14:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-22-085130.png
Polish officials seek access to classified sections of Ukraine's victory plan	Warsaw is seeking to review the classified additions to Ukraine&apos;s victory plan recently presented by President Volodymyr Zelensky, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Teofil Bartoszewsk said in an interview on Oct. 21. Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, presented on October 17, includes five main points and three confidential appendices. During the presentation of the victory plan, Zelensky mentioned that the complete text would remain confidential and only select partners crucial for its execution would be granted access to the classified appendices of specific sections. Bartoszewsk noted that Poland is not among the countries that received full details of the plan, and emphasized Poland&apos;s significant military support to Ukraine. &quot;We provided Ukraine with military aid in the most crucial way, because when Germany was talking about sending them helmets, we sent 320 tanks. So our contribution was obviously significant, especially at the beginning when it was most needed,&quot; he said. The victory plan consists of the following requests: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 18 that Ukraine&apos;s victory plan will be reassessed after the upcoming U.S. presidential election. At the same time, Tusk emphasized that Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership has not changed. &quot;We stand in solidarity with Ukraine on this issue,&quot; he said. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-officials-seek-access-to-classified-sections-of-ukraines-victory-plan/	2024-10-21T22:23:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/poland.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 681,580 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 681,580 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 22. This number includes 1,350 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,079 tanks, 18,199 armored fighting vehicles, 27,111 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,623 artillery systems, 1,234 multiple launch rocket systems, 981 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,404 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-681-580-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-21T22:14:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166158560.jpg
Russia executed 2 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors say	Russian soldiers executed two captured Ukrainian soldiers near Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, the Donetsk regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported on Oct. 21. On Oct. 18, during an attack on Ukrainian positions, Russian forces captured the two unarmed soldiers, forced them face down, and later shot them at close range. This execution is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is considered a serious international crime. Ukrainian law enforcement has launched a criminal investigation under the laws of war. Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has informed the UN and Red Cross about the incident in order to document it. Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-executed-2-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-21T20:05:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Cargo plane shot down in Sudan, Russian nationals possibly on board	Sudan&apos;s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have shot down a cargo plane in Darfur, with speculation that Russian nationals may have been on board. The aircraft, identified as an Ilyushin Il-76 from Kyrgyzstan, had documents connecting it to a UAE-based company. The RSF released mobile phone footage showing identity documents recovered from the crash site, including a Russian passport. Additionally, the RSF stated that &quot;foreign mercenaries&quot; were killed in the operation, further implying the potential presence of Russian citizens. This connection raises concerns about the involvement of Russian mercenaries or private contractors in Sudan&#x2019;s ongoing conflict, which has seen various international actors entangled. Russia maintains a strong presence in African countries like Sudan through Wagner and other entities, propping up authoritarian governments, fueling destabilization, and extracting resources to fund its war against Ukraine. Claims have previously appeared in other media publications that Ukrainian special forces took part in operations in Sudan and are responsible for strikes against Wagner-backed militants. According to the WSJ, Sudan&apos;s de facto ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, appealed to Ukraine for assistance in the summer of 2023 while besieged by rebel forces. Kyiv responded positively in order to curb Russia&apos;s influence abroad, but also because &quot;Burhan had been quietly supplying Kyiv with weapons since shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022,&quot; the outlet wrote. Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Khartoum issued a statement confirming that its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan&#x2019;s Malha region, near the border with Chad.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-shot-down-in-sudan-russian-nationals-possibly-on-board/	2024-10-21T19:21:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/sudan.jpg
US to provide Ukraine with $800 million for drone production, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 21 that the U.S. will provide $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, aimed at funding the production of drones to strengthen the country&apos;s defense capabilities. &quot;Every meeting with our partners involves discussions about the defense-industrial complex,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;We need Ukraine to be able to defend its sovereignty and independence regardless of any political threats in the world.&quot; The announcement followed Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, where the Pentagon chief announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine. The package included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at an event a Kyiv Independent journalist attended. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in early 2022, the United States has committed more than $60 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-800-million-for-drone-production-zelensky-says/	2024-10-21T15:25:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174412815.jpg
Opinion: Money-laundering watchdog FATF needs to blacklist Russia	The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meets tomorrow, Oct. 22, and is expected to once again debate Russia&#x2019;s blacklisting. That Russia, a clear state sponsor of terrorism, hasn&#x2019;t been ousted from an intergovernmental body that sets global standards to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and related financial crimes, is incredible. It&#x2019;s remarkable that Russia isn&#x2019;t already on the FATF blacklist alongside North Korea and Iran. Just ask the CEO of Germany&#x2019;s biggest arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, whom Russia plotted to kill, or consider the Russian bomb plots thwarted by the postal services in the U.K. and Germany. MI5 and its German equivalent have also recently flagged Russia&#x2019;s growing terrorist threat. Russia continues to violate sanctions and encourages others to do the same. As reported by the Financial Times and others, shadow fleets are circumventing sanctions with Russia&#x2019;s support. It would be a fitting move for U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to finally push for Russia&#x2019;s FATF blacklisting. Should a Donald Trump presidency follow, keeping Russia on the blacklist could serve as a bargaining chip for future peace negotiations over Ukraine. In recent months, the mounting pressure on Russia&#x2019;s economy has been evident. The ruble is approaching 100 to the dollar, inflation is rising, and Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank has had to hike interest rates to stabilize the currency and counter inflation. These economic challenges partially reflect new sanctions, including measures against the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and tightened secondary sanctions that make it harder for third-party countries, like China and India, to trade with Russia. Shipping containers sit on rail trailers at a logistics hug on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia, on April 9, 2024. (Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Tightening sanctions on Russia serves several important purposes. First, it weakens Russia&#x2019;s economy, making it harder and more expensive to regenerate its military and wage war on Ukraine. Second, while sanctions were initially imposed in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it&#x2019;s now clear that Russia poses a broader threat to Western interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes he&#x2019;s at war with the West and NATO, so it&apos;s in NATO&#x2019;s interest to weaken Russia&#x2019;s military capabilities. Sanctions help degrade that threat. Third, sanctions damage the Russian economy, giving Ukraine and the West leverage in future negotiations. For this reason, FATF blacklisting Russia makes strategic sense for the West. It&#x2019;s notable that FATF was originally created to counter the threat of Islamist terrorism after 9/11. One argument against blacklisting Russia is that it plays a key role in countering these same radical Islamist groups. However, recent events suggest Russia now poses a greater terrorist threat to the West than these organizations. Moreover, its alliances with Iran and North Korea &#x2013; now supplying 10,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine &#x2013; underscore its alignment with other FATF-blacklisted states. Blacklisting Russia would send a clear message: aligning with Iran and North Korea to wage war against Ukraine and attack Western interests has consequences. A potential counterargument is that blacklisting Russia could reduce its cooperation in fighting Islamist extremism, a key reason FATF was founded. However, given the growing threat Russia faces from these same radical groups, as seen in recent attacks, including the Moscow theater incident, Russia&#x2019;s cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is unlikely to wane. It remains in Russia&#x2019;s interest to address these threats, and FATF blacklisting shouldn&#x2019;t change that.

Is NATO ready for war with Russia?	The launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 confronted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with a new geopolitical reality. Described as &quot;braindead&quot; by French President Emmanuel Macron only a few years prior, the alliance woke up to a threat previously thought consigned to the past: a full-out conventional land war on the European continent. Military officials have since churned out warnings of a resurgent Russian threat to NATO, saying allies must be ready in three, five, or eight years&apos; time. &#x201C;The Russian Federation has become a problem for the world order, for democracy. In fact, it is a war of Russia with the democratic world. It is not (just) a war with Ukraine,&#x201D; Romanian Defense Chief Gheorghita Vlad said in February of this year. After decades of fighting insurgents rather than armies, underfunded European forces still sobering up from the post-Cold War &quot;peace dividend years,&quot; and the shadow of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House, NATO&apos;s readiness for such a clash lies in doubt. &quot;NATO could not defeat Russia given its current capabilities without incurring significant cost in terms of casualties, damage, and temporary loss of territorial sovereignty,&#x201D; Gordon B. Davis, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank and NATO&#x2019;s former deputy assistant secretary general, told the Kyiv Independent. Collectively, the 32 members of NATO can field a powerful, and modern fighting force, but &#x2014; its European contingent at least &#x2014; faces ammunition shortages, a fragmented defense industry, and insufficient air defense coverage. Then there is the question of unity and the will of Western societies to make sacrifices in a costly and prolonged war.

(Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)NATO&#x2019;s capabilities Despite years-long decline, NATO can still pack a punch. In many aspects, even the European part of the alliance can outgun Russian forces, boasting a larger number of active duty personnel, advanced long-range capabilities like Taurus or Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, and larger, more modern airpower. While NATO, not counting the U.S., has roughly 1.9 million active personnel, 2,400 combat-ready aircraft, and 6,650 tanks as of 2024, Russia has estimated 1.1 million active troops, 1,370 aircraft, and 2,000 tanks, according to the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). NATO also grew stronger with the accession of two new members &#x2014; Sweden and Finland &#x2014; adding two well-trained and interoperable militaries to the alliance and a more than 1,300-kilometer-long border for Russia to defend. &quot;There is still an overwhelming ability by NATO for death and destruction in terms of long-range fire, anything launched from the fleet of F-35 (advanced jet fighters), for example,&quot; Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said in comments for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If they (Russia) fought how they fight now, in Ukraine, against a NATO force, they would be destroyed pretty quickly,&quot; he added, referring to Russia&apos;s high-mortality &quot;meat grinder Storm-Z tactics.&quot; Davis agrees that NATO would have the upper hand but wouldn&apos;t avoid losses. &quot;Assuming a conventional fight only, NATO would outfight Russia&apos;s air forces and naval fleets, although its bombers, drones, and submarines would succeed in striking NATO territory and forces,&quot; he said, adding the alliance &quot;would defeat Russian ground forces, but not necessarily prevent them from taking territory.&quot; Many NATO planners have named the Baltic states as the most vulnerable to attack, situated as they are next to Russia, its staunch ally Belarus, and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the 40-kilometer-wide Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic states. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Shock-and-awe vs. the long haulNATO might have the upper hand in a quick, &quot;shock-and-awe&quot; war where their superior firepower would quickly decimate Russian forces. The question is: would this be that kind of war? The Kremlin is certainly aware of its weaknesses and strengths in comparison to its chief geopolitical opponent. As the first year of the full-scale invasion demonstrated, the Russian state and society were ready to absorb initial losses and reconstitute for a long fight. &quot;The majority of the combat experience within NATO forces are from Afghanistan, which is very, very different&#x2026; from what might happen in a potential war between NATO and Russia,&quot; Arnold said. Roughly 3,600 coalition troops were killed in 20 years of the Afghanistan War. The estimates of Russian troops killed in two and half years in Ukraine were placed at around 200,000. Western societies are likely to be much more sensitive to casualties, and their factories and armories have proven unprepared even for a sustained support of Ukraine. Insiders told the Kyiv Independent last month that part of the reason behind slow-paced U.S. aid packages is empty Pentagon shelves. The EU was forced to postpone its promised 1 million shells to Ukraine due to the &quot;lamentable state of the defense industry.&quot; Alternatively, using &quot;salami-tactics&quot; &#x2014; gradually using a series of small military actions rather than one big one &#x2014; would test allied unity and courage to respond. Rather than marching to Berlin or Paris, Russia could try to grab and hold a chunk of the Baltics and ward off any counterattack with the threats of a massive &#x2014; even nuclear &#x2014; escalation. Nuclear weaponry remains the wild card and the Kremlin is not shy about threatening the use of its atomic arsenal. A recent change to its doctrine lowered the threshold for a nuclear response in a gesture obviously aimed at Western powers.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)NATO catching upIn a written comment for the Kyiv Independent, Davis provided a &quot;shopping list&quot; of NATO&apos;s main weak spots: &quot;Integrated air and missile defense, persistent surveillance, long to short range strike systems (including drones), land-based electronic warfare, ground munitions inventories (e.g., artillery, mortars, antitank), and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.&quot; &quot;NATO has exquisite capabilities in all these areas, but not in sufficient numbers, breadth, and depth in terms of stocks and defense production capabilities.&quot; One key reason behind these deficiencies was the peace dividend Europe enjoyed in the post-Cold War period. Believing that the specter of a full-blown conflict with Moscow was gone, European nations cut average defense funding from 2.4% to 1.6% of GDP between 1990 and 2000. Twenty-four countries abandoned conscription in the roughly two decades after 1990. While land forces of (West) Germany, Italy, France, and the U.K. could field 215, 135, 106, and 94 battalions in 1990, these numbers shrank to 33, 46, 44, and 50 by 2020, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says. The U.S. scaled down its presence as well. The alliance started slowly waking up to new realities in 2014 in the wake of the Russian war against Ukraine, the occupation of Crimea and the war in Donbas. &quot;The good news is (that) since 2014, starting with the Wales conference and every summit thereafter, we have truly increased the readiness of NATO,&quot; said retired U.S General Philip M. Breedlove, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR) in 2013-16, in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. Asked whether NATO is ready to face Russia today, Breedlove said: &quot;No, but we&apos;re way more ready than we were in 2014.&quot; The Wales summit saw the establishment of the Readiness Action Plan to bolster collective defense and deterrence. Two years later, NATO launched the Enhanced Forward Presence, deploying initially four, and later eight allied battalions along the alliance&apos;s eastern flank. By 2022, SACEUR commanded 40,000 troops from the Baltic to the Black Sea, in addition to tens of thousands of host countries&apos; troops, and some 100,000 U.S. soldiers in Europe. The preparations kicked into higher gear after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Madrid summit in 2022 saw allies adopt the NATO Force Model, a three-tier defense plan that would make 300,000 troops ready within a month, and half a million within half a year. This was in addition to increased aerial and naval readiness and exercises, such as this year&apos;s Steadfast Defender, which, with 90,000 troops, was the largest NATO drill since the Cold War.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Fresh funds began flowing into defense. Whereas in 2014, only three allies met the 2% of GDP threshold, this number grew to 19 &#x2014; including the newcomer Sweden &#x2014; &#xA0;a decade later. Some members are even calling for raising the benchmark. Since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine 10 years ago, the European allies have increased their defense spending by roughly a third to a total of $380 billion, CSIS&apos;s analysis said. In comparison, Russia&apos;s defense expenditures for the same year were around $110 billion, with much of it allocated to the war against Ukraine. While impressive on paper, many of these plans face challenges with implementation. The efforts to have 300,000 troops on a one-month standby are complicated by disputes between national and NATO authorities, and low enlistment levels in member countries. IISS analysts pointed out that only a few European militaries actually grew in size in the past decade. Despite new investments in defense production, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year that it could take up to two years before artillery shell manufacturing is at the desired level. The aforementioned long-range missiles, like Storm Shadow or Taurus, are not even currently in production, and the former is being used up in Ukraine, Arnold noted. In the end, the execution of these ambitious plans rests on the unity and political willingness of individual members, which may very well be NATO&apos;s Achilles&apos; heel. The possible return of Donald Trump to the White House is increasing concerns across European capitals. The former president famously said that he would encourage Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell it wants&quot; to those members who do not meet the defense spending benchmark. On the other side of the Atlantic, Hungary has been repeatedly breaking the allied consensus, and one official even recently implied that Budapest would not resist a Russian invasion. Populist and radical political forces are growing in Slovakia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Fatigue is also growing across the alliance, even though the current sacrifices mostly entail only small fractions of budgets and retired military hardware. &quot;The main weakness of NATO at the moment is that people just aren&apos;t on the same page with this (Russian) threat,&quot; Arnold said, underscoring the differences between countries in NATO&apos;s north and east on the one hand and the western part on the other. Another great uncertainty is the result of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently fully engaged and have suffered heavy losses. Their capability to reconstitute depends on when and how the war ends. The &quot;how&quot; is the most decisive factor. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said earlier this month that If NATO wants to avoid a clash with Russian forces, it needs to help Ukraine win. &quot;Should Russia be able to rebuild, restructure, and adapt its defense capabilities, and training and doctrine, following a conflict with Ukraine, it would pose an even greater threat to NATO,&quot; Davis warned.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-vs-russia-how-ready-is-the-alliance-for-war/	2024-10-21T12:18:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166545608.jpg
US has provided Ukraine with over $64 billion in military aid since start of full-scale invasion, Umerov says	The U.S. government has provided Ukraine with military aid worth over $64 billion since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 at the joint press briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv earlier in the day in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. During his visit, Austin also announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine, which included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Umerov said at an event attended by a Kyiv Independent journalist. Umerov mentioned that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. &quot;Our drones have become a real threat to the enemy. They can hit targets thousands of kilometers away and have already destroyed more than 200 military facilities in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s defense production potential might approach $20 billion,&quot; the minister said. Umerov also highlighted Austin&apos;s role in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as a Ramstein-format meeting. &quot;You have played a major role in bringing the free world together and coordinating the cooperation of more than 50 democracies to confront the threat posed by tyranny, to fight what seems now a coalition of dictatorships,&quot; Umerov added. Austin, in his turn, said that every time he is back at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where the group was forged, he finds it &quot;moving to look around that long table and to see in human form the global indignation over (Vladimir) Putin&apos;s crimes.&quot; The U.S. Defense Secretary also mentioned that, as a percentage of GDP, a &quot;dozen U.S. allies and partners&quot; now provide more security assistance to Ukraine than the U.S. does. The group members have provided over $1 billion in direct security assistance to Ukraine in total, he added. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The next meeting will be conducted in a virtual setting in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-provided-ukraine-with-over-64-billion-in-military-aid-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-umerov-says/	2024-10-21T12:00:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2169448523.jpg
Only death awaits them' – We asked 5 Ukrainian soldiers about North Korean troops fighting for Russia	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine is on the verge of escalating dramatically, with multiple reports, intelligence assessments, and a video suggesting North Korean troops could soon be fighting alongside Kremlin forces. While Pyongyang has long supplied Moscow with weaponry, the deployment of boots on the ground would mark a significant development that has raised alarm bells in capitals around the world. In the latest development on Oct. 21, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, and called for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with Pyongyang. While not confirming the deployment, Washington has said it is &quot;concerned&quot; about the reports. On Oct. 18, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to President Joe Biden to respond immediately. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied reports. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; Despite Peskov&apos;s vague statements, there is plenty of evidence to suggest North Korean troops are already in Russia training to partake in the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine in some capacity. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 had already been sent. Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they&apos;d be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia surfaced online.

And other people from Russia don&apos;t want to go to this war just for money; it&apos;s a very important sign. &quot;They will be very low-quality troops; they won&apos;t have experience of fighting in this war, so strategically it won&apos;t make a profound difference on the front line. &quot;If North Korea sends many more troops, again, it&apos;s a problem for them. They will have language problems. Ukraine also has experience with (foreign legion) soldiers, so we understand these difficulties. &quot;We must work with South Korea on this problem. We must create a special government program for soldiers to convince them to stop fighting and make a proposal that they can return to Korea, not to North Korea, but to South Korea. &quot;Because many people from North Korea try to run away from the regime to South Korea. This would be a really good program for them.&quot; &quot;We are already at war with one of the strongest countries. There is nothing to worry about. &quot;They shouldn&apos;t come here; only death awaits them here. Let them go AWOL (absent without official leave) straight away. This is not their war and not their country.&quot; &quot;It all depends on how many of them there will be. I&apos;ve heard that some have already been caught in Kursk Oblast. I don&apos;t think their quality is very high. North Korea is a country stuck somewhere in the 1950s-60s. &quot;Of course, this is bad because the more of them there are, the worse it is. (For us, it means) more work. &quot;We should influence them like everyone else through psychological operations, scattering leaflets. It&apos;s not a cure-all, but it&apos;s something even if one percent runs over to us and surrenders. &quot;On a large scale, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll have much impact on anything.&quot; In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (centre L) and North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un (centre R) attend a welcoming ceremony at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea on June 19, 2024. (Gavrill Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Petro Kyzyk, a battalion commander at the National Guard&quot;We will kill everyone who comes to our land as an occupier!&quot; &quot;Technically, Russia is fighting at the expense of its allies: Chinese drones, Iranian missiles and Shahed (drones), Chinese armored cars, North Korean missiles, ammunition&#x2026; And now soldiers. &quot;This speaks to the ridiculous problem that the &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; cannot defeat Ukraine, which is weak on its own and which the West is afraid to help appropriately, so it is sitting on scraps. &quot;But this also speaks to another terrible problem. The &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; is not just pulling what resources it can from its allies, no. It is beginning to fight in a coalition format. &quot;The West is providing little help and reacts sluggishly to the growing scale of the mess. Recent statistics showed that the average age of contract soldiers in the Russian army has reached 50 years. It was also said somewhere that the wounded were sent into battle. I believe the former and would like to believe the latter, but there is no evidence. &quot;Sign-up bonuses for joining the Russian army have increased dramatically over this year. This suggests they need to motivate people to join the army to avoid a general mobilization. &#x201C;Many &apos;experts&apos; bets are in jeopardy because many said Russia would soon run out of steam. But they have found another million-dollar secret place to draw meat from. This is scary. &quot;With another 10,000 more troops, Russia can at least not slow down much, and at most can receive a third of the personnel it needs every month. This is tangible.&quot; Additional reporting by Asami Terajima and Daria Shulzhenko.	https://kyivindependent.com/only-death-awaits-them-we-asked-5-ukrainian-soldiers-about-north-korean-troops-fighting-for-russia/	2024-10-21T11:26:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-843572642-1.jpg
Russian strikes against Pokrovsk district in Donetsk Oblast kill 3, injure 2	Russia attacked the towns of Kurakhove and Myrnohrad in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk Oblast on Oct. 21, killing three and injuring two people, local authorities reported. The eastern front near Pokrovsk has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The city is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. The Russian strike occurred at around 3 p.m. local time in Myrnohrad, which is only seven kilometers (five miles) away from Pokrovsk. A man and a woman were killed, while another man was injured. He suffered shrapnel wounds, the acting head of the town&apos;s military administration, Yurii Tretiak, told the Kyiv Independent. Some 33 houses and outbuildings were damaged in the town. Russian troops also attacked Kurakhove, located west of Russian-occupied Donetsk and some 30 km (18 miles) from the town of Pokrovsk. One person was killed, while another one was injured. The strike damaged a five-story building, as well as an administrative building in Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strikes-against-pokrovsk-district-in-donetsk-oblast-kill-3-injure-2/	2024-10-21T11:17:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/PHOTO-2024-10-21-18-52-56-1.jpg
Opinion: Moldova's EU integration referendum hangs in the balance, highlighting the dangers of oversimplification	Moldovans headed to the polls on Oct. 20 to elect their next head of state and vote on the future of the country&#x2019;s European Union integration. With over 98% of the votes counted on Monday, the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; vote edged ahead at 50.03%, while the &#x201C;no&#x201D; camp, which had maintained a lead since the counting began, stood at 49.97%, according to results from the election commission. President Maia Sandu&#x2019;s decision to align the referendum on amending the constitution for Moldova&#x2019;s EU accession with the first round of the presidential election was a strategic political move. This alignment was approved by the parliament, where Sandu&#x2019;s Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) holds a comfortable majority. To be clear, Sandu and PAS have accomplished more for Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration than all previous governments combined, including those that claimed to be &#x201C;pro-European.&#x201D; However, when it comes to the EU and referendums, I experience anxiety, especially when they seem unnecessary. For instance, we might have had a Constitutional Treaty instead of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the U.K. might still be a member, had politicians not posed a simple yes-or-no question about a complex issue. Not only does this approach narrow the debate &#x2013; offering virtually no alternative among other presidential candidates who also support EU membership &#x2013; but it also carries significant risks, as past examples have shown. During the 2016 Moldovan presidential election, the Kremlin attempted to influence the outcome through disinformation campaigns. While this interference might have occurred regardless of the referendum, it opened an additional front in the virtual battlefield that these elections have become. Reports suggest that up to 150 million euro ($162.9 million) was allocated for social media campaigns aimed at spreading disinformation, interfering with the elections, and destabilizing the country. Additionally, investigative journalists from Ziarul de Garda uncovered that Ilan Shor &#x2013; an Israeli-born Moldovan pro-Russian oligarch and politician &#x2013; funded around 15 million euro ($16.3 million) to directly buy votes from his exile in Russia. This is a staggering sum for a country of just 2.5 million inhabitants. Moscow&#x2019;s nervousness was palpable, especially among pro-European citizens in Chisinau in the days leading up to the vote. The extremely close results, with only a small majority in favor of the referendum, have proved their concerns valid. A negative outcome would not necessarily halt the EU accession process, as the question only aims to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. This change would make it more difficult for future governments to deviate from that path, but it would not render it impossible. However, as mentioned, this approach severely limited the space for discourse. There was no option to support the referendum without also supporting Sandu. The second-place candidate came from the Party of Socialists, which called for a boycott of the referendum. Their deputies also left parliament when, in March, the ruling PAS government majority endorsed a resoluti0on to continue efforts to join the EU. People cast their ballots during the 2024 Moldovan presidential election and the referendum on rapprochement with the European Union at a polling station in Hirbovat, Moldova, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Daniel Mihaliescu /AFP via Getty Images)Instead of engaging in an honest debate about the challenges and opportunities of Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration, as well as the achievements and failures of Sandu&#x2019;s presidency, voters faced a binary choice &#x2013; right or wrong &#x2013; depending on their perspectives. The only option was to counter the blatant propaganda from the pro-Russian side, such as the claim &#x2013; echoed by some EU member states and government &#x2013; that EU membership would embroil Moldova in the war the Kremlin is waging against Ukraine. What could have been discussed is that Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament approved a similar constitutional change in 2019, which may have heightened anxieties for some. A pertinent discussion should involve how Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), or the mutual defense clause, could be interpreted or guaranteed without NATO in a potential EU membership for Ukraine and/or Moldova. Beyond listing the usual advantages of EU membership (such as basic freedoms, no roaming fees, and flight rights), there is a notable lack of positive narratives addressing the fears and concerns of both Moldovans and EU citizens. It may help to put certain matters into perspective. Enlargement would return us to where we once were. The six Western Balkan countries, along with Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, have a combined population of approximately 67 million &#x2013; similar to the U.K. Admittedly, these nine candidate countries have only 10% of the U.K.&apos;s GDP, but enlargement represents an opportunity for stabilizing democracies, as it has in most previous rounds of enlargement. A stable neighborhood has historically led to economic prosperity for both old and new EU members. We should stop focusing solely on the budget (which, at around 142.5 billion euro ($154.6 million), is only about 20 billion euro ($21.7 billion) higher than Austria&#x2019;s). It is evident that not everyone can receive more than they contribute. However, the net payer concept is misleading; for instance, Germany contributes 27% more than France to the EU but benefits 67% more from single market integration. While additional countries in the EU may complicate decision-making, more than 60% of votes since 2010 have been unanimous, even though qualified majority voting (QMV) would have sufficed, according to the German think tank SWP. They have suggested extending QMV without a treaty revision, but perhaps that should only be Plan B. Why not be bold and reintegrate deepening and widening? The complicated journey from the Treaty of Nice to Lisbon &#x2013; including the aforementioned negative referenda in 2005 and an additional one in 2008 &#x2013; took 65 months. The longest successful enlargement negotiations took 77 months, averaging 42.4 months. Therefore, the goal of EU membership for Moldova by 2030, as announced by the government, is achievable with the right ambition and determination from all parties involved. Typically, a referendum on EU membership occurs at the end of this process, not at the beginning. Perhaps there will be more room for discussion leading up to the second round of presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 3, now that referendum anxiety has lessened, albeit by a narrow margin. Ultimately, the real &quot;referendum&quot; will be the parliamentary elections, set to take place by July 2025 at the latest. It is not the president but the government that will determine Moldova&apos;s direction. Until then, there will be plenty of room for anxiety on all sides &#x2013; but there is also still hope for Moldova&apos;s future within the EU.

Ukraine war latest: US announces new defense aid package for Ukraine worth $400 million	Key developments on Oct. 21: The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. Later in the day, the Pentagon said in its press release that the recent package included HIMARS air defense systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, M113 armored personnel carriers, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, and ammunition for high-mobility artillery. Washington also pledged to provide Kyiv with 155 mm and 105 mm artillery ammunition, as well as 60 mm, 81 mm, and 120 mm mortar systems and rounds, among other weapons and training equipment. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter. Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Suspilne earlier reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials, that eighteen North Korean soldiers had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border. Hromadske also reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Korean soldiers that were detained had been left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandon their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system overnight on Oct. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The operation was reportedly carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces together with other military units. The Buk-M3 is the latest version of the Soviet-era Buk systems family. It is a medium-range system that can intercept aerial targets, including tactical ballistic missiles, at a range of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Russian anti-aircraft system was located around 60 kilometers from the front line, the General Staff said. The cost of such equipment is estimated at $40-50 million. The statement did not specify the exact location of the targeted system. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 979 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-defense-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-400-million/	2024-10-21T10:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169770970.jpg
Alexei Navalny's widow Yulia says she will run for president if she can return to Russia	Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, told the BBC in an interview she would run for president if she is able to return to a post-Putin Russia. &#x201C;I will participate in the elections&#x2026; as a candidate&#x201D; when the time is right, Navalnaya told the BBC in an interview published on Oct. 21. Navalnaya said that she aims to &quot;bring closer and make change in the country possible&quot; without going into further details, but added that she is not &quot;a magician and does not know the secret&quot; of bringing about immediate change in Russia. &quot;If you can&apos;t do something big right away, do something small every day, and the more people do that, the sooner it will be time for change,&quot; she said. Navalnaya said her return to Moscow is &quot;unfortunately impossible&quot; as long as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in office. She currently lives abroad and did not attend the funeral of her husband, Alexei, which took place on March 3, in fear of being arrested. In July, a court in Moscow ordered the arrest in absentia of Navalnaya on charges of &quot;participating in an extremist organization.&quot; The charges mean that if she were to return to Russia she would face jail time, similar to her late husband. Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in 2021 after being hospitalized in Germany following an attempt on his life, and was immediately detained. He died in on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in Russia after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Putin for his death. Following the death of her husband, Navalnaya entered more into the public spotlight. She has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s work. Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot,&quot; compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and edited in part by his widow, Yuliya, will be published posthumously on Oct. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnaya-wants-to-participate-in-russias-presidential-election-if-she-returns-to-country/	2024-10-21T09:04:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147917825.jpg
Unprecedented interference' by Russia, its proxies in Moldova referendum, EU says	Moldova&apos;s referendum on joining the EU, which took place alongside elections in the country, occurred under &quot;unprecedented interference&quot; by Russia and its proxies, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said. &quot;This vote took place under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes in the Republic of Moldova,&quot; Stano said on Oct. 21 during a press briefing in Brussels. Voters were almost evenly divided on Oct. 21 on a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution. Preliminary results show that the pro-EU voters won by a razor-thin margin, securing 50.42% of the vote against 49.58% who voted &quot;no,&quot; the country&apos;s electoral commission said. In the presidential elections, Moldovan President Maia Sandu came first in the initial round of the election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Pro-EU Sandu will face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a member of the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, who gained roughly 26% of the vote in the first round. Stano said that the EU is following the referendum and the presidential election in Moldova and will provide an &quot;official reaction&quot; once the final results of both votes are announced. The spokesperson added that attempts to disrupt the voting in Moldova lasted &quot;not weeks but months,&quot; long before Oct. 20. Stano also mentioned vote-buying and propaganda spreading efforts made by Russia and its proxies. &quot;This is an ongoing effort from Russia and its proxies &#x2014; not only in Moldova, indeed, also against our countries &#x2014; and it&apos;s a long-term fight. They don&apos;t have boundaries. We, as the European Union... respect certain principles, including the laws, but Russia and its actors and its proxies do not respect that,&quot; he said. Moldovan authorities have claimed that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans voters who have been instructed on how to cast their ballots in the election. Pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network despite his own political party being banned.

Sending North Korean troops to fight Russia's war would mean 'significant escalation,' Rutte says	The involvement of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine would be a &quot;significant escalation,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 21 after talks with the South Korean president. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. &quot;North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&quot; Rutte said on social media following a conversation with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, without explicitly confirming the reports. The two discussed NATO&#x2019;s close partnership with Seoul, defense industrial cooperation, and the interconnected security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. &quot;Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&quot; Yoon said, according to the Yonhap news agency. &quot;This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the (South Korean) government will never stand by and let this happen.&quot; While the United States is cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-south-korean-president-north-korea/	2024-10-21T05:40:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179187617.jpg
Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia kills 2, injures 15	A Russian strike against the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 21 killed two people and injured 15, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. At least three of the injured are in serious condition. Some 30 buildings were damaged after Russia struck the residential area of the city early on Oct. 21. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. Fedorov did not say what weaponry Russia used in the attack but reported ballistic missile warnings several times during the day. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-against-zaporizhzhia-kills-2-injures-15/	2024-10-21T05:29:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zaporizhzhia-Oct-21.jpg
US announces $400 million defense aid package for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. The exact content of the latest aid package is not immediately clear, but Austin said it would include ammunition, military equipment, and weapons. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-400-million-package/	2024-10-21T05:11:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157421608.jpg
Ex-military logistics chief named new head of Ukroboronprom state defense company	Oleh Huliak, who has been acting CEO of the state-owned enterprise Ukrainian Defense Industry (Ukroboronprom), was officially appointed to the job on Oct. 21, the company announced. Huliak replaced Herman Smetanin, who was appointed the strategic industries minister as part of the biggest wartime government reshuffle in September, replacing Alexander Kamyshin. Smetanin had been in charge of Ukroporonprom since June 2023 after his predecessor, Yurii Husiev, was reportedly dismissed for the company&#x2019;s poor performance under his watch. Ukrainska Pravda reported last June that the main problem for Ukroboronprom under Husiev&#x2019;s leadership was the poor progress in a missile program. The Supervisory Board of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned defense production conglomerate selected Huliak among 20 candidates for the position. Representatives of the U.S., U.K., and German embassies were involved in the interviews with the shortlisted nominees. Smetanin outlined Huliak&apos;s main tasks, such as increasing production volumes, building an effective anti-corruption infrastructure, and completing the reform of Ukraine&apos;s defense sector. &quot;Oleh Huliak is well aware of the immediate needs of the army, he is an experienced leader,&quot; Smetanin added. Before his appointment to Ukroboronprom, Huliak served as the commander of the Logistics Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces since 2021. He started his military career in the 1990s and later held top positions, serving as commander of several Ukrainian brigades. A decorated major general, Huliak headed the Odesa Military Academy from 2012 to 2021. Ukroboronprom is a leading strategic manufacturer of weapons and military hardware in Ukraine. The association includes enterprises that develop, manufacture, sell, repair, and modernize weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. Since the all-out war started, the company has relocated much of its production abroad and reduced its activities across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/oleh-huliak-named-new-head-of-ukroboronprom/	2024-10-21T05:02:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-134439.png
Ukraine destroys Russian Buk air defense system, military says	Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system overnight on Oct. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The operation was reportedly carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces together with other military units. The Buk-M3 is the latest version of the Soviet-era Buk systems family. It is a medium-range system that can intercept aerial targets, including tactical ballistic missiles, at a range of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Russian anti-aircraft system was located around 60 kilometers from the front line, the General Staff said. The cost of such equipment is estimated at $40-50 million. The statement did not specify the exact location of the targeted system. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 979 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/buk-destroyed/	2024-10-21T03:57:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Buk-M3.jpg
Ukraine's 46th brigade releases video of repelled Russian attack near Kurakhove	Ukraine&apos;s 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Oct. 20 that it had repelled a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukrainian troops fended off 59 attacks in the Kurakhove sector over the past day alone, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Oct. 21. Russian forces tried to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines and capture the village of Maksymilianivka to create conditions for further advance toward Kurakhove, the 46th brigade said. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Oct. 20, 2024, showing Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector. (The 46th Airmobile Brigade/Facebook)The unsuccessful attack reportedly involved seven tanks and 11 infantry fighting vehicles, with Ukrainian forces destroying seven pieces of Russian equipment. &quot;Two more damaged tanks managed to roll back,&quot; the brigade said. The fate of the 28 fleeing Russian soldiers is unknown, the unit added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/46th-brigade-kurakhove/	2024-10-21T03:41:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-130947.png
Kremlin calls North Korean troops reports 'contradictory' but stops short of denial	The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. Kyiv and Seoul accused Pyongyang of preparing to send more than 10,000 military personnel to assist Russia, adding that some troops had already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; The reported transfer of North Korean military personnel comes as the most significant step by Pyongyang in support of Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. North Korea has previously provided Russia with extensive arms packages, including artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/peskov-north-korea/	2024-10-21T03:34:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg

Russia attacking toward town near Pokrovsk, National Guard says	Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The estimated advance of Russian forces near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 20, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/national-guard-selydove/	2024-10-21T02:34:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569068.jpg
Seoul summons Russian envoy over North Korean troops' deployment	South Korea on Oct. 21 summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, to protest the dispatch of North Korean troops to assist Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported. Seoul and Kyiv accused North Korea of preparing to transfer between 10,000 and 12,000 military personnel to Russia in a sign of deepening military cooperation between the two countries. Some North Korean troops had reportedly already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine to share experiences with their Russian counterparts. South Korea&apos;s First Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun summoned Zinoviev to call for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with North Korea, Yonhap wrote, citing the South Korean Foreign Ministry. The South Korean diplomat &quot;condemned in the strongest terms the illegal military cooperation, including... (North Korea&apos;s) troop deployment, and sternly warned that South Korea will respond with every possible means, with the international community, to any acts that threaten the core interests of South Korea.&quot; South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. It would mark the first time North Korean forces had been deployed to a foreign war. It remains unclear what steps Seoul is planning to take. Yonhap reported in June that South Korea is mulling openly providing arms supplies to Ukraine in response to deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The Kremlin has previously denied the reports of North Korean troop dispatch as fake news. The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and urged immediate action.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-summons-russian-envoy-over-north-korean-troops-deployment/	2024-10-21T02:14:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-672536428.jpg
UN's nuclear agency funded Russian research in occupied Crimea, RFE/RL reports	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has financed Russian state scientific research in occupied Crimea since the peninsula was illegally captured in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Oct. 21, citing obtained documents. According to the agency&apos;s internal documents, the IAEA signed at least two agreements with Russian research institutes to conduct research that included fieldwork in Crimea. The deals were signed between 2016 and 2019, and the first was reportedly extended in the summer of 2019. The outlet described the projects as limited in size and scope. The IAEA has repeatedly publicly declared its commitment to Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, urging Russia to withdraw from Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, which has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. In a statement to RFE/RL, the IAEA said that the agency continues to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. It described its studies on the occupied territory as being of a &quot;purely technical nature&quot; and said they &quot;do not constitute any change in the agency&apos;s position on the status of Crimea.&quot; The IAEA representative also called the counterpart of one of the projects, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), an international research center based in Moscow Oblast, &quot;not a Russian organization but an International Intergovernmental Scientific Research Organization located in Russia.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s permanent diplomatic mission in Vienna, where the IAEA is headquartered, told RFE/RL that none of the IAEA&apos;s research projects in Crimea have been approved by the Ukrainian government. Previously, Ukrainian authorities criticized the agency for &quot;the ambivalent position&quot; and &quot;the retransmission of Russian propaganda.&quot; Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), visited both Kyiv and Moscow since the start of the all-out war as well as the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Monitoring teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been based at the facility on rotation since September 2022, but Russian authorities still deny IAEA inspectors full access to the plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-crimea/	2024-10-21T01:53:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2056052044.jpg
The Counteroffensive: An inside look at the virtual reality therapy reshaping veterans' rehabilitation	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Oct. 17, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Last year, Mykola Horishnyi was declared clinically dead &#x2013; twice. The Ukrainian soldier suffered severe blood loss from an explosion, likely a Russian mine. &#x201C;Tomorrow will mark exactly one year since I was wounded &#x2013; at 4:45 p.m. I still can&apos;t fully grasp that this all happened to me and that I am no longer in the trenches,&#x201D; Mykola told The Counteroffensive. Mykola suffers from PTSD, making it difficult for him to discuss the traumatic events he endured. He recently began psychotherapy at a rehabilitation center in the Kyiv suburb of Borodianka, which is pioneering unique virtual reality therapy. Ukraine&apos;s Health Ministry reported in August that the number of people struggling with mental health issues has doubled since 2023. Market research data shows that sales of antidepressants have grown by more than 50% compared to the pre-war year of 2021, according to the BBC. Typically, around 15% of people develop PTSD after experiencing traumatic events of violent conflict or war. Most can overcome its effects with the right professional help, though traditional therapy doesn&apos;t always succeed. The increase in mental health problems suggests a major social crisis after the war, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers try to reintegrate into peacetime civilian life. To address these challenges, technological innovators are experimenting with new forms of virtual reality (VR) therapy. &#x201C;If it wasn&apos;t for our doctors, we wouldn&apos;t be talking now,&#x201D; Mykola said. For Mykola, it all began when he volunteered to join the army in February 2023. &#x201C;I wanted to be deployed to the front lines in the east, to get to Crimea, take our Crimea back, and that&#x2019;s it. But of course, it didn&apos;t work out as expected,&quot; he said. A year has passed since Mykola was injured, but he is still haunted by the memories. &#x201C;I still can&#x2019;t fully comprehend that this is my reality now, that I&#x2019;m no longer in the trenches, running around, storming positions. When I close my eyes or sit alone, I feel like I&#x2019;m still there. I see the trenches in my sleep &#x2013; these nightmares never leave me,&#x201D; Mykola said. Currently, Mykola is receiving therapy and retreat services at the Borodianka Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation. The center is one of the few places in Ukraine actively developing VR therapy. Exposure therapy using VR has shown promising therapeutic qualities. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to think of many mental health conditions that it couldn&#x2019;t benefit. We are working on treatments for a large number of conditions,&#x201D; Daniel Freeman, a professor at the University of Oxford, told the BBC. A Ukrainian soldier undergoes a speleotherapy session at a rehabilitation center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 4, 2023. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)A specialist is always present to provide support, but the main goal is to recreate traumatic memories to help the patient overcome stress and fear. &#x201C;Our brains are built in a way that they don&#x2019;t really tell the difference between virtual and physical reality. Virtual reality helps bring a person back to normal memories and feelings by immersing them in a virtual environment,&#x201D; said Yevhen Kotukh, a Ukrainian VR specialist who is actively developing this technology. Yevhen and his team are working on creating a new technology for the rapid diagnosis of PTSD. They plan to use virtual reality to evoke emotional responses in veterans by showing a two-minute simulation of combat operations. Signals from the brain can then help determine whether the person has PTSD. Currently, the VR technology at the center is in the early stages of development, but the team is actively collaborating with donors and partners to improve it. It is expected that standard treatment will require up to ten sessions of 50 minutes each, taking place weekly. When the course is finished, a person&apos;s sensitivity to stress should decrease to a manageable level. Ultimately, VR therapy can help more than two-thirds of people with PTSD when used alongside a psychologist. Traditional exposure therapy &#x2013;where the therapist creates a safe environment and exposes the patient to their fears &#x2013; may not be suitable for everyone and has its limitations. First, it takes time to engage the soldier and begin addressing traumatic events. Second, the veteran&#x2019;s memory and imagination might not be sufficient to process the trauma. Additionally, it can be hard for individuals to open up and speak freely about painful memories. Currently, active cooperation with foreign partners is underway to create a specialized room with sensors that allow for free movement, enhancing the realism of the VR experience. In addition to psychological assistance, VR helps with phantom pain for those who have lost limbs but can still feel pain in the amputated areas. Mykyta Makazan, a veteran who had his leg amputated, faced this problem. He shared that sometimes the pain was so intense it made it difficult to get out of bed. With sensors attached to the muscles of his lost limb and virtual reality games designed to develop motor skills, he can rewire his brain to believe that the limb he moves in the game is his own. This approach helps him move the muscles and stretch them, alleviating the phantom pain. The goal of virtual reality therapy is to relieve the pain experienced in reality. As Mykola discussed the nightmares that still haunt him, his smile faded. To shift the conversation, I asked about things that distract him, and he smiled. &#x201C;Family. Home, routine, communication &#x2013; when my wife comes home from work and we talk, when we go for a walk, this center in Borodianka,&#x201D; Mykola said. All veterans should experience such support and assistance on their difficult paths toward physical and psychological rehabilitation.

Russia detains 18 North Korean soldiers who left positions in Kursk Oblast, source says	Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Eighteen of them had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, Suspilne reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials. Hromadske reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Koreans were left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandoning their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/18-north-korean-soldier-detained/	2024-10-21T01:17:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Update: Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 29 over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The article was updated with the latest casualty figures in Zaporizhzhia. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 28 over the past day, including a child, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 21. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 59 of the 116 Shahed-type attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Forty-five drones were reportedly &quot;lost&quot; on Ukrainian territory, and 10 more were still present in the Ukrainian airspace at the time of the publication. Russia also attacked Ukraine with an Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missile, one Kh-35 guided aerial missile, and one Kh-31P guided aerial missile. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv overnight, all of which were reportedly destroyed. One man was injured, suffering burns to his face, the city authorities said. A Russian missile attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late on Oct. 20 injured four people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The victims included a 12-year-old girl, a 22-year-old man, and two women aged 63 and 36. A hotel, five multi-story buildings, a cultural facility, a bank, two shops, and 14 cars were damaged. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three residents in Novoselydivka, Kurakhove, and Illinka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 20 injured at least 13 people, the State Emergency Service said. Earlier the same day, a 71-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman were found dead under the rubble following a Russian attack against the village of Novoplatonivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Poltava, and Kirovohrad oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-100/	2024-10-21T00:35:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kharkiv-Oct-21.jpg
Russia's Black Sea Fleet forced to redeploy over Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian proxy admits	Russia has redeployed vessels of its Black Sea Fleet due to attacks by Ukrainian naval drones, Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian proxy head of occupation authorities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said in an interview with Kremlin-controlled Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper published on Oct. 21. Rogozin&apos;s surprise admission is in line with previous statements made by Ukrainian officials. Successful Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea forced Moscow to pull out much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian city of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, which became a key port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. According to Rogozin, a &quot;military-technical revolution&quot; took place during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, impacting the usefulness of traditional weapons systems. He referred to the Russian Black Sea Fleet as a weapon system that had undergone changes during the war. &quot;It (Black Sea Fleet) was forced... to change its residence because our large ships became targets for the enemy&apos;s unmanned boats,&quot; Rogozin said. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/black-sea-fleet-changes-its-residence-due-to-ukrainian-drone-attacks-russian-official-says/	2024-10-21T00:22:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240487588.jpg
Russian high-ranking pilot found dead in Bryansk Oblast, military intelligence says	Russian pilot Dmitry Golenkov, who participated in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, was found dead in the town of Suponevo in Bryansk Oblast on Oct. 20, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. According to the agency, Golenkov suffered multiple head injuries, probably caused by a hammer. HUR published photos purporting to show Golenkov&apos;s body in an apple orchard, without claiming responsibility for the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Golenkov served as chief of staff of a Russian aviation squadron. He was a pilot of the 52nd Heavy Bomber Regiment of the Russian Air Force, which is based at the Shaykovka airfield and hosts Tu-22M3 bombers. Russia uses these aircraft to carry out missile attacks against Ukraine. Golenkov was involved in missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian targets, HUR said, including the Amstor shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast in June 2022. According to authorities, more than 1,000 people were inside the building at the moment of the attack. Twenty-two people were killed, and dozens were injured. Golenkov was also reportedly responsible for an attack on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro in January 2023. It was one of the deadliest single Russian attacks on Ukraine, killing 46 people, including six children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-pilot-found-dead/	2024-10-20T23:17:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-664707660.jpg
US Defense Secretary Austin arrives in Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 21 as Ukraine hopes to secure further support ahead of the uncertain U.S. election, CNN reported. Austin&apos;s visit comes only a few days after U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Berlin to meet the leaders of the U.K., Germany, and France to discuss continued support for Ukraine and Kyiv&apos;s five-step victory plan. The U.S. defense chief is expected to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, to discuss Ukraine&apos;s battlefield needs. The visit will also serve as a chance to &quot;step back&quot; and assess the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship over the course of the full-scale war, CNN reported. Ukraine is finding itself in an increasingly difficult position. Despite Washington&apos;s support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/austin-arrives-in-kyiv/	2024-10-20T22:54:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-12-23.21.02.jpeg

Navalny's prison diaries to be published posthumously this week	Alexei Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot&quot; will be published posthumously on Oct. 22. The memoir is compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and was edited in part by his widow, Yulia Navalnaya. The book will be released in 22 languages, including Russian. Navalny died on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in northern Russia, after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his death. In &quot;Patriot,&quot; Navalny wrote that he expected to die in prison. &quot;I knew from the outset that I would be imprisoned for life &#x2014; either the rest of my life or until the end of the life of this regime,&quot; he wrote in a March 2022 diary entry. &quot;I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here.&quot; Navalnaya has said she hopes the memoir ensures that her husband won&apos;t be forgotten and that his political activism continues to inspire the Russian opposition movement. &quot;I want his voice to be heard loudly even after his death,&quot; she told the BBC&apos;s Russia service in an interview ahead of the book&apos;s release. Navalnaya has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s political work. A Moscow court ordered her arrest in absentia in July, charging her with &quot;participating in an extremist organization&quot; due to her involvement with the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization founded by her late husband. Navalnaya would &quot;go to the elections as a presidential candidate&quot; if she ever returned to Russia, she told the BBC. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny&apos;s death.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnys-prison-diaries-to-be-published-posthumously-this-week/	2024-10-20T19:22:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2008366667.jpg
Ukraine's new 'Sting' drone designed to hunt Shaheds, Telegraph reports	Ukraine is developing a new drone that can track and intercept Shahed-type attack drones, the Telegraph reported on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Kyiv&apos;s new weapon, named &quot;Sting,&quot; is a first-person-view (FPV) drone that can chase and neutralize Shahed drones in lieu of conventional air defense systems, the Telegraph reported. According to the drone&apos;s developers, the Wild Hornets group, &quot;Sting&quot; will be able to fly at altitudes approaching 10,000 feet, with a speed of over 100 miles per hour. The weapon will be operated from the ground using VR goggles. It is the first drone specifically developed to target Russia&apos;s arsenal of Shaheds. &quot;Its average cost is dozens of times lower than that of the Shahed drone,&quot; a Wild Hornet source told the Telegraph regarding the Sting drone. The lower production costs may allow Ukraine to conserve its air defense munitions over the coming months, as Russia intensifies aerial attacks targeting Ukrainian cities and the nation&apos;s energy grid. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 20 that Russia has launched a total of 6,230 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine since the beginning of the year. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing modern warfare. Multiple videos have shown how Ukrainian FPV drones hit Russian reconnaissance drones and other costly equipment on the battlefield. Ukraine in September established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to drone warfare. Kyiv said it aims to produce 1 million drones this year, in addition to the thousands pledged by foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-sting-drone-designed-to-hunt-shaheds-telegraph-reports/	2024-10-20T17:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Sandu leads in 1st round of Moldovan elections, voters reject EU referendum	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Moldovan President Maia Sandu led the first round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with nearly 39 percent of the vote, the Moldovan election commission announced. The preliminary results are based on over 93 percent of the tallied votes. If no candidate wins a majority, a second round of voting will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu will likely face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who captured approximately 28 percent of the vote in the first round. Moldovan voters also rejected enshrining the country&apos;s path to European Union accession, with over 52 percent voting against the amendment in a referendum held alongside the presidential election. The election results have been tainted by allegations of Russian interference, with Moldovan lawmakers claiming that Moscow spent millions of dollars in a campaign to unseat Sandu and vote down the EU referendum. Tensions between Moscow and Chisinau have been mounting since February 2022 amid fears that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine may spill into Moldova via Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway territory occupied by Russian troops since 1991. The pro-Western incumbent, Maia Sandu, has previously accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow her government in an attempted coup. &#xA0; Throughout the current election, allegations of Russian meddling continuously surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. The Kremlin&apos;s efforts are part of a broader attempt to undermine Moldova&apos;s pro-Western leadership in the country. Moldovan authorities have said that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote in the upcoming election. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Moldova&apos;s state-owned broadcaster reported on Sept. 28 that vandals had splashed paint across the entrance of its building in the capital city of Chisinau. This incident occurred a day after police attributed similar acts to a group trained in Moscow with the aim of destabilizing the elections. The U.S., U.K., and Canada warned of potential Russian interference in Moldova&apos;s elections in a joint statement issued on June 13. &#xA0; &quot;If Russia&apos;s election meddling proves unsuccessful in Moldova, there is reason to believe Moscow will work to incite protests,&quot; the statement said. Shortly after the warning, Sanda approved changes to the country&apos;s treason laws, allowing some wartime treason laws to apply to peacetime, as well as extending punishments and creating a new category of laws for assisting a foreign state. Moldova launched EU accession talks in Luxembourg on June 25, the same day that Ukraine began its long-awaited membership negotiations. The Oct. 20 referendum, if passed, would have amended Moldova&apos;s constitution to formally include the country&apos;s accession to the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandu-leads-first-round-moldova-elections/	2024-10-20T16:18:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178740400.jpg
Russian missile attack in Kharkiv injures 9	A Russian missile attack targeting Kharkiv the evening of Oct. 20 injured nine civilians, the Kharkiv Oblast police reported. The wounded include four women aged 22 to 53 and five men aged 21 to 37, according to regional authorities. Russian missiles targeted three districts in the city of Kharkiv at around 10 p.m. local time, police reported. Some areas of the city lost electricity due to the attack. The strike also damaged apartment buildings, houses, garages, gas stations, and cars. Emergency workers have been dispatched to all attack sites and the full consequences of the missile strike are currently under investigation. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-in-kharkiv-injures-9/	2024-10-20T14:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Russia has launched over 6,100 attack drones at Ukraine since start of 2024, Zelensky says	Russia has launched a total of 6,130 Shahed-type drones since the start of 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. In recent weeks, Russia has stepped up its drone attacks &#x2014; for the first time since the full-scale invasion, they targeted cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis since the start of September. On Aug. 26, Russia launched its largest attack on Ukraine so far with 127 missiles and 109 drones, while Ukraine downed 102 missiles and 99 drones, according to the Air Force. Russian strikes hit several civilian, energy, and fuel facilities, including a dam in Kyiv, part of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant. Recently, Russia appears to have switched tactics to use more drones in its attacks, with the country utilizing 129 Shahed-type drones in its attack earlier this week on Oct. 18, Zelensky said. In his evening address, Zelensky criticized &quot;the free world&apos;s indecision&quot; in delaying the provision of additional defense systems. &quot;There needs to be more pressure on Russia&apos;s ability to already produce these weapons. We need the capability to destroy not only the storage bases for the &apos;Shaheds&apos; but also the entire infrastructure for their production and logistics.&quot; On Oct. 9, Ukraine&apos;s military struck a base storing 400 Iranian Shahed-type drones near the village of Oktyabrsky in Russia&apos;s Kranodar Krai. While initially sourcing Shahed-type drones from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-launched-over-6-100-attack-drones-at-ukraine-since-start-of-2024-zelensky-says/	2024-10-20T13:23:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1982613220-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine says it struck airfield and 'largest explosives factory' in Russia	Key developments on Oct. 19-20: Ukraine said on Oct. 20 that it attacked Russia&apos;s &quot;largest explosives plant&quot; and an airfield overnight, the latest in a series of long-range drone attacks in the rear to slowly grind down the bigger foe&apos;s powerful war machine from afar. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the drones targeted the large state-owned Sverdlov Plant in the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 900 kilometers deep into Russia. The plant has been under sanctions by the U.S. and the EU since 2023, over what the U.S. State Department says is its work &quot;acquiring goods in support of Russia&apos;s war effort.&quot; The factory produces explosives, industrial chemicals, detonators and ammunition, the U.S. said in a press release when the sanctions were announced. The source told the Kyiv Independent that the plant produces aviation and artillery shells, aviation bombs, and warheads that help Russia continue waging its war against Ukraine. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported later in the day that Ukraine had also struck the Lipetsk-2 airfield in the Lipetsk region, located over 400 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. This attack targeted ammunition depots, fuel storage facilities and aircraft on an airfield known to be home to Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft, it added. The operations were carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, the SBU source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. &quot;The SBU worked on strengthening the sanctions against the Sverdlov plant,&quot; the SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We added drones to the economic sanctions, which give an instant effect. Work on reducing the enemy&apos;s military capabilities will continue.&quot; Earlier in October, another Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. In September, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions. A Russian overnight missile strike on the central-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih injured 17 people, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, reported on Oct. 20. Russian troops struck the city, located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, twice with ballistic missiles, according to Vilkul. Eight of the injured are currently in the hospital, but their conditions are &quot;moderate,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Vilkul said that Russia targeted &quot;peaceful civilian sites,&quot; damaging 15 buildings, three educational institutions, three administrative buildings, seven businesses, a hotel, three fire trucks, and 20 cars. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, has regularly faced missile attacks, as it is located not far from the front line. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election scheduled for Oct. 26. The &quot;Georgia Chooses the European Union&quot; march brought what appeared to be several tens of thousand of protesters to the streets of the Tbilisi, social media videos show. Protesters waved EU and Georgian flag while singing the country&apos;s national anthem. President Salome Zourabichvili, a vocal opponent of the ruling Georgian Dream party, participated in the rally, urging protesters to vote for pro-European parties during the election. Zourabichvili said the protest &quot;shows that Georgia has already won and will reintegrate with Europe.&quot; Zourabichvili also addressed President Volodymyr Zelensky in her speech, stating that Ukraine is &#xA0;&quot;fighting for Georgia as well. You will be victorious and we will enter the European Union together.&quot; Ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in Georgia, massive pro- EU march is underway in #Tbilisi. #GeVote2024 pic.twitter.com/VyLPUnX2vy Georgia&apos;s received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023. Although questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-38/	2024-10-20T11:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245598723.jpg

Belarus downs Russian drone over its airspace, monitoring group says	The Belarusian Air Force downed a Russian Shahed-type drone over the country&apos;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. The incident marks just the third time a Belarusian aircraft has downed a drone that entered its airspace. According to the monitoring group, three Russian attack drones entered Belarus&apos; southern territory beginning around 12:30 a.m. local time. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk in Homel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones that Russia launched overnight. The Air Force added that 13 drones were lost from Ukraine&apos;s radar overnight. In early September, Belarus&apos; military confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on for the first time since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2013; its key ally &#x2013; over the reported drone incidents. According to Belarusian Hajun, there have been multiple cases of Russian Shahed-type drones flying off course to Belarus over the past few months as drone attacks intensify.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-downs-russian-drone-over-its-airspace-monitoring-group-says/	2024-10-20T08:47:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg

Moldova votes in election, EU referendum amid alleged Russian interference	Moldova&apos;s upcoming presidential election and EU referendum on Oct. 20 are seen as critical in determining its future direction toward European Union integration. Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu is leading in the polls, but if she doesn&apos;t reach the 50% threshold, a runoff will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu also hopes for a strong &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum to solidify EU accession as a constitutional goal. Allegations of Russian meddling have recently surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. Over $15 million in Russian funds have been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Despite these developments, police are confident that any interference will not significantly affect the election outcome.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-votes-in-election-eu-referendum-amid-alleged-russian-interference/	2024-10-19T21:26:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg
Russia's attack on Sumy Oblast's town kills 1, injures 11	Russian forces launched an attack on Shostka, a town in Sumy Oblast, overnight on Oct. 19 using guided bombs and drones, regional authorities reported. One civilian was killed, and 11 others were injured in the attack, according to Mykola Noha, mayor of Shostka. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. The mayor reported that several critical infrastructure facilities, including two schools, a kindergarten, multiple medical institutions, and 28 apartment buildings, were damaged in Shostka. Most residents in the area were left without electricity and water. Emergency crews were dispatched to the site of the attacks and conducted repairs, and rubble clearance was almost complete as of 8 p.m. local time on Oct. 19. Shostka, with its pre-war population of approximately 72,000, is located 180 kilometers northwest of the regional capital, Sumy. In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs near the border areas of Sumy Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attack-on-sumy-oblasts-town-kills-1-injures-11/	2024-10-19T18:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168180900.jpg
Russian victory would bring 'chaos,' French FM says	French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned during a visit to Kyiv on Oct. 19 that a Russian victory over Ukraine would bring &quot;chaos&quot; to the international system. Barrot&apos;s comments came as Russian forces continued their offensive in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, including the capture of the key town of Vuhledar in early October. Barrot&apos;s visit was intended to reaffirm France&apos;s strong support for Ukraine following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s unveiling of his victory plan to defeat Russia. The plan includes a call for increased Western military support. &quot;A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,&quot; Barrot said, standing alongside his counterpart Andrii Sybiha. When asked if Paris supported Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, Barrot confirmed, &quot;We support the victory plan because we have been alongside Ukraine for nearly 1,000 days.&quot; However, in the rest of his remarks, Barrot referred more generally to a &quot;peace plan&quot; as the way to end the war without specifying an official position on Zelensky&apos;s detailed proposals, Agence France-Presse reported. Like other Western allies, Paris is still reviewing the plan&apos;s specifics. After meeting with Barrot, Zelensky expressed gratitude to France, saying the support for the victory plan could &quot;bring real diplomacy and a just peace closer.&quot; He described their meeting as &quot;exactly what we needed&quot; during his evening address. The core of Zelensky&apos;s plan includes an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, a position that Barrot said Paris is &quot;open&quot; to discussing with other alliance members. The plan also rejects territorial concessions and urges allies to lift restrictions on using long-range weapons provided to Ukraine against military targets within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-victory-would-bring-chaos-french-fm-says/	2024-10-19T16:33:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179544991.jpg
Russia strikes Zaporizhzhia, injuring 10	At least 10 people were wounded in an aerial bomb attack on central Zaporizhzhia on the evening of Oct. 19, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. The National Police confirmed that Russian forces carried out three airstrikes on Zaporizhzhia using high-explosive bombs. The blasts partially destroyed a residential building and caused damage to nearby shops, a car wash, a shopping center warehouse, and several vehicles. Two girls, aged nine and 13, are among the injured and are receiving urgent medical care, Fedorov added via his Telegram channel. Zaporizhzhia Oblast in southeastern Ukraine remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s attacks. It is also one of the four oblasts Russia claims to have annexed in September 2022, although Ukrainian forces still control about a third of the oblast, including the regional capital. Russia has increased its air strikes on Zaporizhzhia, causing numerous civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Russian troops began using highly destructive guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Sept. 23. Before that, the city was targeted only with missiles and drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-zaporizhzhia-injuring-10/	2024-10-19T14:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-19-15_23_27.jpeg
With US elections looming, Biden’s Berlin swan song was all talk, no action on Ukraine	Joe Biden&apos;s likely last European visit as president was billed as a final chance before the upcoming U.S. presidential election to meet with key world leaders, solidify long-term support for Ukraine, and work towards ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched over two and a half years ago. &quot;Ukraine faces a tough winter. We must sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,&quot; Biden told reporters before the talks in Berlin on Oct. 18, as cited by the Washington Post. &quot;I know the cost is heavy. Make no mistake, it pales in comparison to the cost of living in a world where aggression prevails, where large states attack and bully smaller ones &#x2014; simply because they can.&quot; However, according to a joint statement released by the White House, Paris, Berlin, and London, Ukraine&apos;s situation and support from Western allies seem to have largely remained the same as they were the day before Biden&apos;s trip to Germany. It offered no new pledges of game-changing support beyond current levels of weaponry provided or progress on key issues such as authorizing long-range strikes inside Russia with Western weapons, NATO membership, or implementation of other requests within President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan.&quot; Instead, it repeated condemnation of &quot;Russia&#x2019;s continued war of aggression against Ukraine&quot; and highlighted &quot;discussions&quot; of &quot;plans&quot; for &quot;additional security, economic, and humanitarian assistance.&quot; The vague and non-committal language from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies contrasts starkly with the increased diplomatic urgency that has consumed Kyiv in recent weeks. Yet the reasons behind both are almost certainly the same &#x2014; the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, uncertainty about who will take over as leader of Ukraine&#x2019;s top Western ally, and how strong their backing for Kyiv will be. Recent polls show that in the approaching election, Biden&#x2019;s Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Party&#x2019;s candidate, is in a dead heat race with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has questioned support for Ukraine and has a history of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Kyiv, one fear is getting continued U.S. support under a Harris presidency coming at a pace even former NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg has said was too slow and gradual. A bigger one is having support sharply cut under a Trump administration. Both scenarios have triggered Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials to intensify efforts to secure long-term defense support now and push allies to ease restrictions on the use of their weapons for strikes in Russia. So far, Zelensky&#x2019;s administration has had limited success. &quot;The elections are currently, as they usually do, holding U.S. politics hostage and until the conclusion of it, no significant legislative change can be expected,&quot; Benjamin Bardos, a transatlantic security expert from the Warsaw Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) greets U.S. President Joe Biden at the Chancellery on Oct. 18, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)In late September, Zelensky met with Biden to present his five-point victory plan, which includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO before the war ends and authorization to strike deep inside Russia with Western long-range weapons. The plan also has three classified sections shared with international partners. Zelensky then toured Europe with the plan but has not yet secured the full support for the strategy from either American or European leaders. Just a week before Biden&#x2019;s visit, Zelensky also traveled to Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Following their meeting, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion). But Berlin continues refusing to send long-range Taurus missiles or allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets deep within Russia. &quot;We are supporting Ukraine as powerfully as we can and at the same time we are making sure that NATO does not become a party to the war, so that this war does not turn into an even bigger catastrophe,&quot; Scholz said in remarks to the press before the meeting with Biden on Oct. 18. Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and special representative to Ukraine under Trump&#x2019;s first presidency, said Biden&apos;s trip had two main goals. The first was to show the American public that Europe also contributes significantly to help Ukraine in its existential fight against Russia. Trump, who has since his first presidency lambasted European countries for not contributing enough to their defense while relying instead on U.S. taxpayers as an umbrella of security, has repeatedly said that Europe should do more to end the war raging on their continent. The second goal, according to Volker, was to discuss with allies how they can strengthen the EU&apos;s defense industry and provide Ukraine with more weapons to counter Russia&#x2019;s vast military power. Volker emphasized Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent need for more ammunition, longer-range munitions, improved air defense systems, and additional support in the Black Sea. However, he expressed uncertainty about whether these priorities align with the Biden administration&#x2019;s plans given the looming elections. &quot;What Ukraine needs is fairly obvious, they need more ammunition and they need it more quickly, they need to use the munitions that we&apos;re giving them at longer range,&quot; Volker said. &quot;So those are all things that are on the Ukrainian list. It&apos;s just that I&apos;m not sure they&apos;re on the Biden administration&apos;s list that they intend to do,&quot; Volker added.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Oct. 17 that Biden planned to consult with German, French, and U.K. leaders on what they had discussed with Zelensky during his European tour. White House spokesperson John Kirby later said that Washington is still reviewing Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; and expects to make further security commitments at the next meeting of Western allies within the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the regular Ramstein meetings. Biden had initially planned to visit Germany the prior weekend to take part in a Ramstein international meeting to coordinate aid to Ukraine. That trip was canceled due to Hurricane Milton in Florida. According to the White House, the Ramstein meeting has been rescheduled to be held online in November, though it&#x2019;s unclear if it will be before or after the U.S. elections. Catherine Sendak, director of the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that Western leaders have and will continue to discuss which parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; they support or want to adjust. She added that the authorization for long-range strikes against Russia with Western-provided weapons is &quot;a hot topic.&quot; &quot;Because there&apos;s such a lull in parts of the conversation in the Western world about Ukraine due to (U.S.) elections and a lot of other things, hyper-focusing on this issue (aid to Ukraine) again in the fall, I think, is very important,&quot; said Sendak. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint press conference with the German Chancellor prior to a meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, on Oct. 18, 2024. (Tobias Sschwarz/AFP)The U.S. has already indicated that Ukraine shouldn&apos;t expect a formal NATO invitation soon since there is still no consensus among allies. Although the latest NATO summit in the summer reaffirmed that Ukraine will join the military alliance, Sullivan said there is still &quot;work to do&quot; to get there, including &quot;reforms and security conditions being met.&quot; The reforms involve &quot;the institutionalization of the security support apparatus for Ukraine,&quot; Sullivan added. As Trump has indicated he would be more hesitant than Biden to provide military aid to Ukraine and suggested the U.S. should not defend NATO allies who don&#x2019;t pay their fair share, concerns have grown about potential global alliance shifts if he wins the presidency. When asked before the Berlin visit whether Biden has been &quot;Trump-proofing&quot; the U.S. government for a potential Trump presidency, Sullivan replied that Biden is working to make the U.S.&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine &quot;sustainable and institutionalized for the long term.&quot; &quot;Since President Biden is not running for office, he doesn&apos;t need to be here in the United States campaigning. He has an opportunity to sit down with world leaders and really hash out some significant support and assistance,&quot; said Sendak. However, Biden&apos;s visit to Germany was never likely to yield major decisions on increasing support for Ukraine or implementing key points of Zelensky&apos;s &quot;Victory Plan,&quot; such as a NATO invitation or permission for long-range strikes, according to Volker. &quot;The main reason is the same as always &#x2014; fear of escalation. Fear that Russia would view this as NATO playing a direct role in attacking Russia, fear of nuclear usage&#x2026;,&quot; he said. His comments refer to the Biden administration&#x2019;s long-lasting fear of Russia pulling allies into the war, potentially by conducting nuclear missile strikes on Ukraine. Any significant decision to increase support for Ukraine will likely be postponed until after the U.S. election also because Biden&#x2019;s administration is wary of Trump accusing them of pushing the country into World War III, which could hurt Kamala Harris&#x2019;s campaign. &quot;It&#x2019;s not a serious argument. It&#x2019;s a political argument,&quot; Volker said of Trump&#x2019;s election campaign rhetoric that has claimed U.S. support for Ukraine against Russia&#x2019;s invasion risks escalation into a global war. Bardos pointed to a Republican backlash over Zelensky&#x2019;s September visit to Pennsylvania, a key swing state, as one reason why congressional approval for foreign aid is &quot;off the table&quot; for now. Instead, any short-term U.S. support will likely come from the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which had about $2.8 billion remaining for the fiscal year as of late September, according to Bardos. Emphasizing that U.S. assistance to Ukraine and involvement in European security would unlikely come to a grinding halt in case of a Trump presidency, Sendak said the EU should nonetheless take on a larger role in ensuring continued aid to Ukraine. But not enough efforts have been made to strengthen the union&#x2019;s defense industry, she added. Bardos cautioned that EU resources would not be sufficient without continued large support from the U.S. &quot;While the EU member states possess significant defense industries, it would be close to impossible for the EU alone to &#x2018;step up&#x2019; support and fill the role of the U.S. without a comprehensive overhaul of individual member states&#x2019; defense industries and forming a united front in the EU, which as far as current politics goes, is extremely unlikely,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-us-elections-looming-bidens-berlin-swan-song-was-all-talk-no-action-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178315214.jpg
Ukraine’s NATO membership on 'irreversible path,' G7 defense ministers reaffirm	Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states. The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-membership-on-irreversible-path-g7-defense-ministers-reaffirm/	2024-10-19T11:49:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
US Intelligence Chairman urges immediate action on North Korean troop movements in Ukraine	U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to U.S. President Joseph Biden on Oct. 18 to respond immediately to reports of North Korea&apos;s troops preparing to join Russia&apos;s army fighting in Ukraine. North Korea troops attacking Ukraine from Russia or entering Ukraine &#x201C;must be a red line for the United States and NATO,&quot; Turner said. Turner also cited public reports from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence agencies that suggest North Korean troops may be moving via Russian naval vessels. Calling the situation &quot;alarming&quot; and a major escalation of the conflict, Turner urged the U.S. and NATO to act immediately. He requested an urgent classified briefing for the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, emphasizing the need for swift U.S. and NATO action to prevent a broader conflict. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-chairman-urges-immediate-action-on-north-korean-troop-movements-in-ukraine/	2024-10-19T09:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Investigation: Russians carry out systemic terror in occupied part of Kherson Oblast	On the morning of Nov. 20, 2023, Russians came to Raisa Rusnak&#x2019;s home, looking for her 28-year-old son Ruslan. Four masked men threw him onto the ground and began beating him. &quot;Guys, what have I done to you? What do you want from me?&quot; Ruslan shouted. Those were the final words Raisa heard from her son. She never saw him alive again. Eight days later, she identified his body at the morgue. She was told that he had died of internal bleeding from a stomach ulcer during interrogation by the Russian occupation police. The woman is convinced that her son was tortured to death. Even the official Russian death certificate states that Ruslan died on the day of his detention &#x2014; a week before she was informed of her son&apos;s death. &quot;He was lying there&#x2026; His eyes were open, his teeth were showing. He must have died in such torment. What my child endured, I can&#x2019;t even imagine,&quot; Raisa said. Ruslan was interrogated at the former Ukrainian police station in the town of Hornostaivka, on the Dnipro River&apos;s east bank, in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Moscow has controlled this territory since 2022. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of about 6,500 people, was occupied in April 2022. Raisa left the town for Ukrainian-controlled territory in early 2024. In the police headquarters on Torhova Street in Hornostaivka, where Ruslan was taken, the Russian occupation police have been operating for two and a half years. The occupiers have established a torture chamber in this building. Ruslan is one of many Ukrainians taken there by the Russians and not the only one for whom it ended fatally. The fate of many others remains unknown. Russia has terrorized the local population in torture chambers across the occupied territories, with previous reports indicating the use of this tactic in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as the previously occupied areas of Kherson Oblast.

Right: Ruslan Rusnak and his mother, Raisa Rusnak, who fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2024. (Courtesy)One of those missing is Oleksandr Slisarenko, a local entrepreneur and volunteer in Hornostaivka. When the Russians took control of the town, his wife left, but he decided to stay and help others. &quot;He was responsible for a lot of people. He could not leave them. &#x2018;Maybe you could come here?&#x2019; I&#x2019;d ask him. &#x2018;No,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t leave those grannies. It will get better soon,&#x2019;&quot; his wife Liudmyla recalls him saying. Liudmyla currently lives in Poland. Since leaving Hornostaivka in April 2022, she had kept in touch with her husband by phone and on messenger applications. But on Aug. 3, 2022, the connection was cut off: in the morning of that day, the occupiers took Oleksandr away. &quot;He went out into the yard to do some chores &#x2014; he came out in the same clothes he had slept in. And our house was, you could say, already surrounded. They tied his hands, put him on his knees, and began to torture him. He was beaten very badly on the spot. Witnesses saw it all. After that, he was thrown into a minibus with a bag over his head, and that was it,&quot; Liudmyla said. From that moment on, Oleksandr&#x2019;s trail was completely lost. Liudmyla does not even know if he was taken to the police station on Torhova Street. But she does know that it is common for Russians to imprison, interrogate, torture, and kill people there. Liudmyla told the Kyiv Independent that another victim of the Russian occupiers in Hornostaivka is Volodymyr Ruchka, a driver from the local health inspection service. He was also taken to the police station on Torhova Street in the first year of the occupation. &#x201C;He just said something, something they didn&#x2019;t like. They took him to the police station and beat him up. He was beaten, released, and he died the next day.&#x201D; The map shows the Dnipro River that divides Ukraine&apos;s southern Kherson Oblast into Russian-occupied territory east of the river and Ukrainian-controlled territory west of the river. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of 6,500 people, has been occupied since April 2022. (The Kyiv Independent)&#xA0;We learned similar stories from other residents of Hornostaivka who were able to leave. At present, interviewing such witnesses is the only way to learn about Russian war crimes in the occupied territories. The east bank of Kherson Oblast is under tight control, and no one but Russians have access to it: neither independent law enforcement agencies, nor documentarians, nor journalists. In the course of our investigation into Russian terror in the occupied territories, we interviewed dozens of people who managed to leave &#x2014; some of them as recently as the summer of 2024. Most of them asked for anonymity or refused to be interviewed out of fear of the Russians. Almost all of them have relatives or friends left in the occupation who could face retaliation for these testimonies. One woman from Hornostaivka told the Kyiv Independent that a story similar to that of Volodymyr Ruchka happened in the summer of 2023 with another man, Serhii Klopot. &#x201C;He was taken right from the market. They dragged him out of the store at the market, threw him into a minibus, and two days later, he was brought to his yard and dumped. His neighbors picked him up. Two days later, he died. He was beaten very badly,&#x201D; she said. She also said that shortly thereafter a group of Russian police officers, one of whom introduced himself as &quot;Vladimir,&quot; threatened her with meeting Klopot&apos;s fate. According to this woman, the Russians mainly persecuted former Ukrainian soldiers and weapons owners. Anyone who showed a pro-Ukrainian position could also be persecuted. However, other witnesses added that the Russians also terrorized business owners who could be deprived of their property. This was a particularly common practice during the first year of the occupation. &quot;Those who had businesses were detained for the purpose of ransom and so on. It was always solved the same way: you bring money, they let you go. People&apos;s cars were taken away in the middle of the night, they came, broke into garages and drove cars away, houses were robbed,&quot; said Henadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka who agreed to speak to us openly. Kryzhanovskyi, too, was held in the building on Torhova Street in the fall of 2022. He was released only after he signed a statement about the transfer of his cars for the needs of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;special military operation.&quot; He was able to leave the occupied territories only in July 2024. The entrance to the former Ukrainian police station on Torhova Street in Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast, photographed in 2012. After occupying Hornostaivka in April 2022, Russian occupation forces have turned the police headquarters into a torture chamber. (Courtesy)Kryzhanovskyi was not the only one forced by the Russians to &quot;voluntarily&quot; give up his property. Others include the pastor of the Baptist church in Hornostaivka, Oleksandr Maltsev. In the fall of 2022, Russian forces searched the church premises, and Maltsev himself was taken to Torhova Street. He spent a little over two weeks in detention and was forced to give away his two cars. Residents of Hornostaivka also told us that people not only from the town but also from neighboring villages and towns and even from the cities of Kakhovka and Nova Kakhovka, located tens of kilometers away, were brought to and held in the police station on Torhova Street. Olha (name changed) from the village of Kairy, eight kilometers from Hornostaivka, said that the Russians also took residents of her village to the police station on Torhova Street. &#x201C;They abducted people, tortured them and beat them. And as far as I know, those people were hit with everything, even electrocuted. They tortured them like that because they (Russians) wanted to show us that they were the masters and we were the simple people who must obey them. People said: they&#x2019;ve tried everything, except for one &#x2014; putting electrodes under the nails,&#x201D; said the woman who left Kairy in the summer of 2024. Olha also said that Russians could punish Ukrainians in the village even for saying &#x201C;Glory to Ukraine,&#x201D; a Ukrainian national salute. The screenshot from a video published by a Russian propaganda media outlet showing the Vladimir Lenin statue in Russian-occupied Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast.&#xA0;&quot;One man was taken by the arms and taken away. A week later, maybe a little more, we were told that he was found, and that they had killed him. Another woman had a birthday, was a little drunk, went to the store, and said, &apos;Glory to Ukraine, Glory to the Heroes.&apos; The Russian soldiers looked at each other, did not touch her at first. When the woman had just crossed the threshold to leave the store, they took her by her arms and stuffed her into a car... And I don&apos;t know whether she is alive or not, because the woman is missing too,&#x201D; Olha said. All of the testimonies we gathered paint a picture of systemic terror, with its epicenter in the torture chamber in Hornostaivka. This terror apparently began in August 2022 &#x2014; and continues to this day. Ruslan Rusnak, who was most likely tortured to death on Torhova Street in November 2023, was not the only one taken by the Russians in the town at that time. The same month, brothers Ivan and Anton Shtepa, as well as Denys Shum, were held there, too. It is not known where they are now. It was the case of Ruslan Rusnak that allowed us to identify the Russian police officers involved in his death and the terror of the local population. In February 2024, one of the Russian anonymous Telegram channels reported that in connection with his death, Russian law enforcement agencies were prosecuting five police officers from Hornostaivka for &#x201C;abuse of office.&#x201D; The message included the names and initials of these police officers. It was easy enough to identify one of them &#x2014; Andrey Polevshchikov, who was the head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka at the time of Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. A man very similar to him can be seen in a video shot in the town back in August 2023. In October, he spoke to a Russian propaganda media outlet about the work of the police. &quot;Citizens are happy to cooperate with the police because they see us as a helping hand. Initially, of course, you could see that the population was cautious of police officers, but when they saw our work in action, they welcomed us,&quot; Polevshchikov said in the video. Andrey Polevshchikov, the former head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka, speaks to a Russian propaganda media outlet in Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast, in August 2023. (The Kyiv Independent)Other names mentioned in this message from the anonymous Telegram channel were &quot;V. Pliukhin, V. Merkurov, I. Pimenov, and A. Denisov.&quot; We were able to identify Russian policemen Igor Pimenov and Vasily Merkurov but found no confirmed connection to Hornostaivka. In the case of &quot;V. Pliukhin,&quot; we decided to try out the name &quot;Vladimir&quot; (&quot;Volodymyr&quot; in Ukrainian) as standing for &quot;V,&quot; since several residents of Hornostaivka gave us this name in connection with the terror of Russian police officers. This is how we learned about Volodymyr Pliukhin, a former Ukrainian police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast who defected to Russia at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In the video mentioned earlier, Polevshchikov says, among other things, that a police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast has joined the staff of the Hornostaivka police station. We showed a photo of Volodymyr Pliukhin, found on the Internet, to several residents of Hornostaivka. Two of them recognized the policeman as the one who had participated in the terror in the town. One witness pointed out that this person was the &quot;Vladimir&quot; who threatened her with the fate of Serhii Klopot, who was tortured to death. Another witness, who was imprisoned in the police station of Hornostaivka, told us that this man was guarding the captives in Torhova Street in December 2022 &#x2014; and said to them that he was from Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Volodymyr Pliukhin, a former Ukrainian police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast who defected to Russia at the beginning of the full-scale invasion and joined the staff of the Russian occupation police in Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast. (The Kyiv Independent)We also learned the developments of the &quot;abuse of office&quot; charge against these policemen. Under the pretense of an association of former Russian police officers, we called Polevshchikov and offered to support him. He told us that the case had been opened on Feb. 1, 2024, almost two and a half months after Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. However, according to Polevshchikov, he no longer needs any help. &quot;The case has already been suspended. It will be terminated due to the injury. I signed a (military) contract and joined the &#x2018;special military operation.&#x2019; I&apos;m home already with an injured arm and leg. We came across a landmine,&quot; Polevshchikov told us in a phone conversation. He added that all the employees of the Russian-run Hornostaivka police station who had been prosecuted in the case joined the military and were wounded in action with him. By signing contracts to participate in the Russian-Ukrainian war and being &quot;wounded in action,&quot; the Russian policemen from Hornostaivka, in fact, avoided any responsibility for Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. When Raisa Rusnak learned of the Russian law enforcement investigation into her son&apos;s death, she did not believe in Russian justice. &quot;I think it was just a pretense, that&apos;s all,&quot; she told us. There are no great hopes for the official Ukrainian investigation, either. Law enforcement officers can&apos;t enter the occupied territory, they don&apos;t have access to the bodies to conduct all the necessary forensic examinations, and they can&apos;t interview witnesses on the spot. As for interviewing people who have managed to leave, they often face the same obstacle as journalists and documenters: people are too afraid to testify. Meanwhile, Russian terror continues on the occupied east bank of Kherson Oblast. And though some residents were lucky to have managed to flee, it is notoriously difficult for Ukrainians to leave the occupied territory. Ruslan Rusnak tried to do so in 2022, but the Russians would not let him out because of his former service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Hennadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka, was able to leave on his second attempt. Olha from the village of Kairy managed to leave with her husband and children. But while crossing the border, Russians beat her husband and threatened him with murder and her with sexual violence. Even those who leave the occupied territories often deal with the trauma from Russian terror, either from what they have experienced themselves or from what their relatives and friends have endured.

His other grandfather has been dead for some time. I want Oleksandr to see his grandson grow up,&quot; she said, barely holding back tears. For Raisa Rusnak, the Russian occupation terror took away her son, her home, and justice, leaving nothing but nightmares. &quot;I moved to my daughter&apos;s place and have given her no rest. I have cried day and night. I imagine how they are killing my child, and I get scared. In my nightmares, I now see my daughter being abducted or my second son taken away. And I scream at night, I disturb everyone&apos;s sleep. I cry and scream at night. That&apos;s it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-russians-carry-out-systemic-terror-in-occupied-part-of-kherson-oblast/	2024-10-19T09:29:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-19-at-17_54_12.jpg
At least 102 Ukrainian POWs executed by Russia, ombudsman says	Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity. Lubinets said that Ukrainian authorities document the cases as much as possible and pass the evidence to the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation. &quot;In my opinion, the main reason (for the executions) is that the Russian military does everything possible so that Russian soldiers have no desire to surrender to Ukraine,&quot; Lubinets said. Apart from that, Russians kill prisoners to demonstrate their disregard for international law, according to Lubinets. &quot;They want to show that they are not going to be punished for it (by the international community),&quot; he added. &quot;This is a deliberate policy of Russia, but international organizations turn a blind eye,&quot; Lubinets said. &quot;I see no public or legal reaction to these events - there are still no arrest warrants for war criminals,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/102-ukrainian-pows-executed-by-russia-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-19T08:12:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2037955866.jpg
Romania says drone breached its airspace during Russia's attack on Ukraine	An unidentified flying object was detected by Romanian radar systems near the Black Sea during Russia&apos;s overnight attack on Ukraine on Oct. 19, the Romanian Defense Ministry said. It is the second time this week that Romanian airspace has been violated, following the incident only a day ago, when Romania and Belarus scrambled jets in response to targets flying in their airspace during the Russian drone attack on Ukraine late on Oct. 17. On Oct. 19, Romania once again scrambled two F-16 fighter jets and two Spanish F-18s that are used for air policing missions in the country. In both incidents, the targets disappeared from the radars before the pilots could find them. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Oct. 18 that the incident could have been a cyber attack against the country&apos;s defense system since &quot;pilots did not have visual contact with the drone.&quot; Russia launched up to 98 drones and six missiles against Ukraine on Oct. 19, injuring people and causing destruction that led to power outages in three Ukrainian regions. &#xA0; Romania, a NATO member, has reported numerous incidents when its airspace was violated over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and condemned Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine as violations of international law. Over the past year, debris from Russian drones were found on the Romanian territory as Russia carried out attacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-says-drone-breached-its-airspace-during-russias-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T07:28:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1779469255.jpg
Russian major killed by car bomb in occupied Luhansk, Ukraine's intelligence claims	Russian Major Dmitriy Pervukha was killed in the center of Russian-occupied Luhansk after his car exploded, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 19. &quot;On Oct. 18, 2024, at about 11:40 a.m., a UAZ Patriot car exploded&quot; on one of the streets in Luhansk, HUR said on Telegram. Pervukha was inside the car, according to HUR. Pervukha was allegedly involved in war crimes against Ukraine. He served in the 273rd Intelligence Center of the Russian Armed Forces , located in Russia&apos;s Novosibirsk. In the occupied territories of Ukraine, Pervukha held the position of the so-called &#x201C;chief of staff for military service and security of military service,&#x201D; according to HUR. Russian Investigative Committee announced that a criminal case was opened on Oct. 18 to investigate the explosion that killed an unnamed man and wounded a woman in another car. While HUR called Pervukha &quot;a war criminal&quot; and said that every crime against Ukraine would be &quot;justly punished,&quot; it didn&apos;t claim responsibility for the attack. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, numerous assasinations of Russian military commanders, officials, and collaborators via car bombs were reported in the Russian-occupied Crimea, parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-major-killed-by-car-bomb-in-occupied-luhansk-ukraines-intelligence-claims/	2024-10-19T06:06:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gur-pervukh-2.jpg
Russian attacks kill 4 people over the past day, cause power outages in 3 Ukrainian regions	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 20 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 19. Ukrainian air defenses downed 4 out of 6 guided air missiles Kh-59/69 and 42 attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-six drones were countered by electronic warfare means. In total, over 100 air targets were detected by Ukrainian forces during the Russian attack. Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry reported on the morning of Oct. 19 that over 73,000 consumers in three oblasts were left without electricity due to Russia&apos;s recent attacks. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. On Oct. 19, Russia launched a missile and drone attack against Cherkasy Oblast in the center of Ukraine, killing an elderly woman in Uman district and hitting a critical infrastructure facility, said Governor Ihor Taburets. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and two more wounded in Russian strikes in Kurakhovo and Hirnyk, said Governor Vadym Filashkin. Russian attacks also wounded nine people in Kherson Oblast, hitting residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Sumy Oblast, a man&apos;s body was found under the rubble of a building in Shostka following three aviation bomb strikes overnight, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported. Eight other people were wounded, including five rescuers from the local emergency service department that was hit by Russia. At the time of the attack, emergency workers were at the shelter, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said. In Kyiv, one woman was wounded by a piece of shrapnel from the drone attack overnight, said Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. In Odesa, a missile strike caused a fire in a residential area of the city, damaging a three-story residential building and 10 houses, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said. No casualties were reported. In Chernihiv Oblast, the Russian strike hit an infrastructure facility, causing fire, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-people-over-the-past-day/	2024-10-19T04:45:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/odesa-kiper.jpg
Puzzle company Frisson helps Ukrainians escape wartime reality	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. As a child, Kseniya Morozenko would piece together cut-up postcards at her grandmother&#x2019;s home in Donetsk Oblast. Years later, Morozenko was stuck at her apartment in Kyiv during the Covid-19 pandemic and remembered the homemade jigsaw puzzles from her childhood. She searched in shops in Ukraine, but could only find jigsaws for children, which gave her the idea to set up Frisson, a puzzle company featuring Ukrainian artwork geared towards adults. &#x201C;I want to support Ukrainian modern art and contemporary artists and show their work through puzzles,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent at a trendy bookshop in Kyiv that sells Frisson&#x2019;s products. The puzzles are elegantly packaged with the pieces wrapped inside an environmentally-friendly mesh bag and bundled with two coasters, a postcard, a note, and a poster of the design. Morozenko says she was inspired by Apple&#x2019;s boxing and spent a long time crafting the packaging, including hand-stitching the first 200 mesh bags herself. In 2020, the market was wide open for Frisson as no one else was doing anything like it in Ukraine. Morozenko, who had spent nine years working as a client manager with Ukrainian brands, invested $5,000 of her own money into the project and is a one-man team, although she recently hired a social media manager. By the summer of 2021, nine months after Morozenko conceived the idea, Frisson began producing its first jigsaws in Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s printing mecca. The first puzzle retailed for Hr 500 ($12) and featured one of Morozenko&#x2019;s favorite murals in Kyiv painted by artists Viktoriya Lime and Andrii Kovtun. (L-R) Ksenia Morozenko, a founder of Frisson holds Frisson products. (Maryna Khmarka / Frisson)Supporting artistsMorozenko now has a queue of artists wanting to work with Frisson but she only selects those who are involved with charity projects. So far, the company has worked with 15 artists on 22 designs, including large 500-piece puzzles and smaller 100-piece postcard jigsaws, which are all made with recycled materials. Many of the artists have a notable following in Ukraine, including the globally-known artist and muralist Waone, and the designs often sell out quickly as they are limited to a run of 200. The artists set the price themselves, starting at $100, and Morozenko pays them upfront, particularly now with the uncertainty of war. &#x201C;You never know what will happen tomorrow,&#x201D; she said. Frisson has sold over 3,000 puzzles via its online store and 20 shops across Ukraine, including Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and smaller cities like Uzhhorod and Ivano-Frankivsk. Morozenko also hauls jigsaws to artisan markets and makes specially commissioned pieces for companies. With the larger puzzles retailing for Hr 700 ($17) and the smaller ones for Hr 300 ($7), Morozenko wants to spread the work of established artists to a bigger audience. &#x201C;The puzzles make art accessible to everyone,&#x201D; she said. Foreign artists have also contacted Morozenko, eager to work with Frisson. She is contemplating the idea, but says she will only work with artists from countries that are supportive of Ukraine like Lithuania, Canada, and the U.K. While Frisson is becoming more popular abroad, with orders from the U.S. and Australia, most customers are in Ukraine where Morozenko has spent the last few years building up a &#x201C;puzzle culture&#x201D; for grown-ups.

(Olha Rudnieva / Frisson)Like the puzzle boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, many Ukrainians are seeking comfort and escape from the brutal reality through jigsaws. At the start of the full-scale invasion, one of Frisson&#x2019;s most popular designs featured a group of friends enjoying a picnic. &#x201C;People ordered it as a gift and sent it to their friends with a postcard saying, &#x201C;Imagine it&apos;s us after our victory.&#x201D; I would sign and personalize the postcard,&#x201D; Morozenko said. The puzzles have also helped veterans. The company partnered with the Superhumans Center in Lviv for wounded soldiers and Morozenko says the jigsaws help with both physical and mental rehabilitation. One soldier even completed the puzzle with his prosthetic arm, surprising the doctors who didn&#x2019;t believe it was possible to clasp the small pieces. &#x201C;I just cried after seeing that,&#x201D; Morozenko said. At the outbreak of the war, Morozenko had to shut down printing operations in Kharkiv as Russian troops attempted to besiege the city. For two months she searched for a new printing facility, eventually finding one in Lviv after a tip from another company making puzzles. Frisson still had stockpiles of puzzles from the Kharkiv printing factory and began sending 50% of the money from sales to the Armed Forces. Morozenko strongly believes that every Ukrainian company should help the war effort and Frisson has a collection of charity puzzles with half of the proceeds going to NGOs or the army. The company also ships free jigsaws to organizations that help orphaned children and displaced people. Morozenko wants to bring people together through her puzzles and her slogan &#x201C;Better Together&#x201D; is proudly printed on the front of every box. With success at home, Morozenko is preparing to expand into the foreign market too. So far, the Ukrainian diaspora in countries like the U.K. and Canada has brought Frisson&#x2019;s puzzles but Morozenko wants to expand further. L: A hnd holding one of the Frisson products.

The program, launched by the Ukrainian government and USAID, will train and mentor companies on how to set up online Etsy stores and open doors to foreign markets. In addition to jigsaws, Morozenko also knits and sells anti-stress balls and coasters, while also signing postcards, personalized notes, and running between different artisan markets. Despite managing the company entirely by herself, with the occasional helping hand from friends who model for photoshoots, Morozenko finds the inspiration to keep going from the artists and organizations she works with. &#x201C;If they don&#x2019;t stop, how could I?&#x201D; she said. Frisson turns peaceful moments into artful experiences through its unique jigsaw puzzles, created in partnership with well-known Ukrainian artists. During these tough times, Frisson provides a sense of solace to Ukrainians, including veterans in rehabilitation.

MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 77	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 77 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 7- Oct. 13, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The parliament adopted in the final reading the draft law on tax increase. On Oct. 10, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the final reading draft law #11416-d to increase taxes. However, one key amendment which included all major suggestions from the Tax Committee was rejected during the voting. Particularly the norm which enables the draft law to come into force retrospectively from October 1. For example, it seems that the increase of military levy will be applied only after the draft law is signed and published that will decrease expected revenues from its adoption. The draft law also provides in 2024 50% of income tax for banks as a windfall tax, although the NBU, the IMF, and the Finance Ministry were against this. During the revision, lawmakers slightly relaxed the burden of the law by saving the military levy at 1.5% for military service people. Overall, the draft law is expected to bring around Hr 25-30 billion ($600&#x2013;700 million) of additional budget revenues this year and Hr 150-160 billion ($3.6&#x2013;$3.9 billion) in 2025. After the adoption, some of the lawmakers submitted 13 resolutions to cancel the decision of the parliament. However, on Oct. 14, the Rada rejected all resolutions and unblocked the opportunity for the speaker to sign the draft law. It has been already sent to the Office of the President for signing. The Parliament adopted a draft law needed to fulfill the obligation to increase the number of the HACC&#x2019;s members. The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11426 to prolong the mandate of the Public Council of International Experts (PCIE) which will vet candidates to the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) till the end of selection process but no later than Nov. 1, 2025. This step is needed given the PCIE&#x2019;s expiry in October 2024, as more time is needed to finish the ongoing selection process of new HACC judges. The adoption of the draft law implements the EU recommendations, soft commitments to the IMF and will make a necessary step for Ukraine to be able to fulfill the obligations of the Ukraine Facility to increase the number of HACC&#x2019;s members (with the deadline set for the first quarter 2025). The Parliament considered two draft laws required by the Ukraine Plan. Last week the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy which is one of the obligations under the Ukraine Facility financial mechanism. Moreover, the Parliament adopted in the first reading the resubmitted revised draft law on plea agreements #12039. The new draft was supported by SAPO and NABU. The new provisions of the draft law allow for a shorter prison term than currently required in case of cooperation with the investigation through exposure of accomplices and compensation for damage. For example, five years of imprisonment instead of eight years. At the same time, the court will be able to determine a large fine up to Hr 102 million ($2.4 million) as an additional punishment and confiscate the property. What is important, that this mechanism can&#x2019;t be applied as a general rule to organizers of corruption schemes, with the exception of cases in which such an organizer exposes another organizer. Ukrainska Pravda reports systematic pressure from the Presidential Office. Last week, one of the key independent Ukrainian media outlets Ukrainska Pravda released an official statement to report the ongoing and systematic pressure of the Presidential Office on the editorial team and certain journalists of Ukrainska Pravda. In particular, the media accused the office of blocking officials from communicating with Ukrainska Pravda journalists and participating in events; pressure on businesses to stop advertising cooperation with Ukrainska Pravda; openly emotionally-charged communication between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Kravets during the public press conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-77/	2024-10-19T03:26:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 151	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 151 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 6-12, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s CEO Yevhen Liashchenko filed a resignation letter, the company&#x2019;s supervisory board said on Oct. 7. The board added that it planned to consider the resignation according to the applicable procedures in the coming days. There was no news on the results of that consideration at the time of writing. Formally, for Ukrzaliznytsia, it was the Cabinet of Ministers that decided on CEO appointments and dismissals on proposal of the supervisory board, meaning that Cabinet could not appoint or dismiss the CEO without such a proposal. The SOE law changed significantly in February 2024 (see our Issue 120), and it is the supervisory board&#x2019;s exclusive power now. As we wrote in Issue 80, on March 21, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Yevhen Liashchenko as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years to replace Oleksandr Kamyshin, who had become the new strategic industries minister. In September 2024, Kamyshin stepped down from his ministerial post and is now a presidential advisor and member of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board (see our Issue 146). Previously, Liashchenko served as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board member, responsible for finance. There were no public comments from Liashchenko on his resignation; however, several reputable media &#x2014; including Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and Forbes Ukraine &#x2014; suggested several possible reasons. According to EP, the resignation coincided with the appointment of Oleksiy Kuleba as the new deputy prime minister for restoration &#x2014; minister for communities and territories development, who is now responsible infrastructure sector, and Kamyshin&#x2019;s return to Ukrzaliznytsia as a supervisory board member. After his resignation, Liashchenko would return to the position of an executive board member until the end of his contract, i.e., for another six months, the media outlet added. According to EP&#x2019;s sources, the reason for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is also connected with Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new priorities, primarily to raise funds for capital investments, including the modernization of the company&#x2019;s infrastructure and rolling stock. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources also confirmed this. &#x201C;Liashchenko was supposed to stabilize the company, and he did that. Now the company faces new challenges and needs a different person. Ukrzaliznytsia needs a completely different pace of change. It needs to accelerate,&#x201D; the media&#x2019;s source at the Cabinet of Ministers said. One of the possible reasons for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is that he failed to adequately communicate the need for raising freight tariffs to businesses. Without this, Ukrzaliznytsia would not be able to achieve financial stability, the source added. As we reported in Issue 72, Ukrzaliznytsia incurred losses of Hr 10.8 billion in 2022 (318 million euros at that time). The loss from passenger transportation was Hr 13.3 billion (391 million euros at the time), suggesting that the company&#x2019;s other segments, such as cargo transportation, made a profit of Hr 2.5 billion (73 million euros). As we wrote in Issue 80, in March 2023, after his appointment as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years, Liashchenko got several key tasks, one of which was for the company to break even. In September 2023, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia was reaching break-even and would finish the first nine months of 2023 with a profit (see Issue 103). Ultimately, the company finished 2023 with a net profit of Hr 5 billion ($121 million). See Issue 127 for more detail. On Nov. 20 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s financial plan for 2024, with forecast losses of Hr 12.6 billion (&#x20AC;323 million). See Issue 112 for more detail. As we wrote in September, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia made a profit of up to Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in the first half of 2024, but lost Hr 600-700 million ($14-16 million) in July-August and expected a minor loss by the end of 2024 due to a decline in profitable types of cargo. See Issue 146 for more detail. According to EP, liga.net, and Forbes Ukraine, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, head of the company&#x2019;s passenger business (and executive board member), is likely to become the new CEO. Pertsovskyi could be appointed as soon as this week, liga.net added. According to EP, in addition to Liashchenko, other changes are expected on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board: Two seats would be cut, with these officers moving to other positions within the company. The number of executive board members would be reduced from eight to seven, with the above two positions replaced by a member in charge of HR, the media outlet wrote. Since an independent supervisory board was established at Ukrzaliznytsia in 2018, the company has seen six CEO changes. Much of this six-year period, the company was managed by acting CEOs. Since its establishment in late 2020, the SOE Weekly has covered the four most recent CEO changes at Ukrzaliznytsia. See our Issues 19, 39, and 80 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia requires substantial long-term transformation and faces several challenges. These include unbundling its different businesses, such as cargo and passenger services. It must also address its implicit public service obligation, as passenger transportation is currently loss-making and is cross-subsidised by cargo revenues. Additionally, the company needs to renew its worn-out fixed assets and prepare for competition once private companies are allowed to provide locomotive services. In addition, Ukrzaliznytsia faces wartime challenges, including the assignment to evacuate people from areas near the frontline. To handle these issues, the company needs a permanent CEO with a long-term planning horizon. The selection of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new supervisory board has not started, despite legal requirements. As we wrote almost three years ago, the Cabinet approved members of the railway operator&#x2019;s supervisory board on Dec. 29 2021 (see our Issue 60). Anatoliy Amelin, Alexander Doll, Jakub Karnowski, and Gebhard Hafer became independent members, while Serhiy Leshchenko, Serhiy Moskalenko and David Lomjaria were appointed as state representatives on the board. According to the law effective at the time of appointment, as well the company&#x2019;s charter, the maximum term of office of supervisory board members is three years. Thus, the tenure of the above supervisory board should expire on Dec. 28, 2024. Since 2021, only the recent appointment of Oleksandr Kamyshin as a supervisory board member of Ukrzaliznytsia (state representative) has been known publicly. According to media reports, Kamyshin replaced Serhiy Moskalenko in this position. At the same time, the mandatory disclosures that joint-stock companies must make according to the capital markets law and disclosure regulations of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), are not available on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website. In particular, the information on company officers, such as the management and supervisory board, is missing. Also, according to the new requirements of the SOE law (which were introduced by Law No. 3587, effective March 8 &#x2014; see our Issue 122), the selection of supervisory board candidates for an SOE must begin no later than three months before the respective supervisory board member&#x2019;s term of office ends (unless a decision has been made to extend his/her term of office), or no later than 10 days from the day of his/her early termination of powers. The SOE law now also requires that such selections must follow the principles of collective suitability, board diversity, equality of requirements, professionalism, openness, and transparency. This means that the Cabinet, as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s ownership entity, should have made a decision &#x2014; by Sept. 29 &#x2014; to either extend the powers of the current supervisory board members or announce a selection of board members. PrivatBank appoints a new CEO. On Oct. 7, PrivatBank announced that its supervisory board had elected Mikael Bjorknert (Sweden) as the bank&#x2019;s new CEO, following a competitive selection that included high-calibre candidates from both Ukraine and abroad. Bj&#xF6;rknert&#x2019;s candidacy is pending approval by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The bank said that Bj&#xF6;rknert has over 25 years of experience in the financial sector. Most recently, he served as head of Swedish Banking at Swedbank. Before joining Swedbank, Bj&#xF6;rknert held the position of Chairman of the Board at Swedish Bankgirot, Head of Global Transaction Services at SEB Bank, and Member of the Board at Nasdaq (Sweden). At PrivatBank, Bjorknert will focus on advancing the bank&#x2019;s customer-centric model, accelerating digital initiatives, and ensuring future-proofing, the bank added. Preparing the bank for privatization is not listed among Bjorknert&#x2019;s tasks, as it was for PrivatBank&#x2019;s current CEO, Gerhard Bosch. As we reported in late June 2024, Bosch filed his resignation notice. According to EP, the unofficial reason was the discrepancy between the tasks assigned to Bosch and the reality: When Bosch was elected as PrivatBank&#x2019;s CEO in May 2021, his tasks included preparing the bank for privatization. However, during the full-scale war, this process was put on hold, EP wrote. See Issue 138 for more detail. As we wrote in September 2024, Bosch&#x2019;s contract would be terminated on Nov. 1. Forbes Ukraine then wrote that unless the winner of the competitive selection for the new CEO is determined by that time, one of the executive board members would start managing the bank as an acting CEO. (See Issue 147 for more detail.) However, if Bjorknert is cleared by the NBU, PrivatBank will not require an interim CEO, with its competitive selection appropriately completed on time. Competitive selection for three independent members for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board announced. On Oct. 10, the Economy Ministry announced that the SOE Nomination Committee approved the candidate requirements. The deadline to apply is Oct. 31. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. &#x201C;We strongly believe that the decision on the early dismissal of the CEO of Ukrenergo is politically motivated and, based on the results of the presented report, there are no valid grounds for it,&#x201D; they said in a statement. Currently, Roman Pionkowski is the only remaining independent member of the supervisory board of Ukrenergo. He was appointed together with other independent members in December 2021, meaning that his term of office should expire in December 2024. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine will have access to about $1.1 billion. According to the IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry [in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the ministry added back then. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. As we reported in June 2023, the Cabinet still had to select and approve one independent member for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. Hence, independent members did not constitute a majority of the board, which did not meet the requirements of the law or Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter. See our Issue 95 for more detail. As we reported in April 2024 (Issue 129), the Economy Ministry announced a competitive selection to find the lacking independent board member. See Issue 129 for more detail. The Economy Ministry expects that by Nov. 7, the executive search consultant will have conducted a preliminary assessment of the documents, interviewed the applicants, and submitted a list of potential candidates. The selection of all board members &#x2013; four independent and three state representatives &#x2013; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. UMCC finally sold. On Oct. 9, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC) for Hr 3.94 billion ($95 million), just Hr 39 million ($948,000) more than the starting price of Hr 3.9 billion ($94.8 million). On Oct. 11, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the results of the auction. The sale of UMCC was the country&#x2019;s second online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, the SPFU said. The first one was Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel, which was sold for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million). See Issue 148 for more detail. According to the SPFU and Prozorro.Sale, the only bidder, and, accordingly, the winner, is Cemin Ukraine LLC, owned by Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Hasanov. Hasanov is the owner of the Azerbaijani NEQSOL Holding, which is known in Ukraine for being the owner of the telecom company Vodafone Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, NEQSOL also owns the telecom operator Bakcell. Besides, NEQSOL has extensive experience in the mining business. Its subsidiary, Nobel Oil E&amp;P, is engaged in exploration and production, while Nobel Energy provides services to oil and gas operators. NEQSOL&#x2019;s oil and gas production business is concentrated in Azerbaijan, the U.S., and the U.K. According to the privatization terms, the winner must maintain UMCC&#x2019;s core business and invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.7 million) in technical re-equipment and modernization. In addition, it must pay off overdue accounts payable (Hr 609 million or $14.8 million) and wage and budget arrears, if any, at the time of transfer of ownership, the SPFU explained. Also, 20% VAT is added to the purchase price, bringing the total value of the lot to nearly Hr 5 billion ($121 million), Oleksiy Movchan, deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Economic Development, noted. &#x201C;NEQSOL aims to implement its plans to modernize, develop new products through deep processing of raw materials and expand into global markets alongside fulfilling all privatization obligations,&#x201D; NEQSOL Holding&#x2019;s Country Director Volodymyr Lavrenchuk said. UMCC is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest titanium ore concentrate mining and processing company. It comprises Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Irshansk Plant in Zhytomyr Oblast. In October 2023, UMCC resumed shipments of ilmenite concentrate to the European market (see Issue 106 for more detail). The company&#x2019;s net profit for the first half of 2024 was over Hr 61.6 million (1.4 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). This was not the first attempt to sell UMCC. As we wrote in Issue 33 three years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that auction because it only had one qualified bidder. The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatization, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was inadequate. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company&#x2019;s mineral deposits. The SPFU&#x2019;s auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for more). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for more detail). See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57. In Issue 105, we reported that the SPFU changed UMCC&#x2019;s executive board, dismissing first deputy CEO Yaroslava Maksymenko and replacing her with Yegor Perelygin in September 2023. As we wrote in Issue 135, the Cabinet appointed Perelygin as UMCC&#x2019;s acting CEO on June 4. As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. The starting price would be determined with BDO Corporate Finance, the SPFU&#x2019;s advisor on the privatisation of UMCC. However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October 2023 that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant. Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot. The SPFU auction commission determined the terms of UMCC&#x2019;s privatisation on May 23, setting the starting price at Hr 3.9 billion (90 million euros at that time). See Issue 133 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 150, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) completed the pre-trial investigation into the Dmytro Sennychenko case, alleging the SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices of embezzling millions from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and UMCC in 2019-2021. See our Issues 80, 83, 114, 131, and 150 for detail. Cabinet puts seized VSMPO Titan Ukraine on privatization list. On Oct. 8, the Cabinet of Ministers added one more seized Russian company to the large-scale privatization list &#x2014; the Nikopol plant of seamless titanium alloy pipes, or VSMPO Titan Ukraine. The SPFU said that value of the company&#x2019;s assets as of Dec. 31, 2023 was Hr 271.7 million ($6.6 million). The auction commission will set the starting price and terms of sale and submit them to the Cabinet for approval. After that, the date of the privatization auction will be announced, the SPFU added. As we wrote almost two years ago (Issue 72), the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) seized a part of Russian oligarch Mikhail Shelkov&#x2019;s Ukrainian assets, including VSMPO Titan Ukraine, in January 2023. On Feb. 3, 2023, the HACC seized Shelkov&#x2019;s another key asset, the Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant (see Issue 74). Shortly after that, the Cabinet transferred Shelkov&#x2019;s assets to the SPFU, including Demurinsky (see Issue 77). In October 2023, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said that the SPFU intended to offer investors to buy Demurinsky as a single package with UMCC (see Issue 109). Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot (see Issue 133). As we wrote in Issue 140, on July 9, the Cabinet added Demurinsky to the large privatization list.

Russian electronics plant reportedly on fire after drone strike in Bryansk	The &quot;Kremniy El&quot; microelectronics plant caught fire in the Russian city of Bryansk following a Ukrainian drone strike overnight on Oct. 19, Russian and Ukrainian media reported. &quot;Kremniy EL&quot; is one of the largest microelectronics plants in Russia that produces components widely used in Russian defense production, including for Pantsir air defense systems and Iskander missile systems. The plant is located over 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) north of the border with Ukraine&apos;s northern Sumy Oblast. It was attacked at least once before, in August 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defense had downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Bryansk Oblast, six over Belgorod Oblast, two over Rostov Oblast, and one over Belgorod Oblast overnight. Later in the morning, the ministry reported four more drones downed over Bryansk Oblast by the Russian air defense. Russian media published videos shot by local residents of at least one explosion and smoke plumes rising over the factory. Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz reported the fire in a &quot;non-residential building&quot; following the Ukrainian attack, claiming that it was put out by the Russian emergency workers. He reported no casualties. Later in the morning, Bogomaz claimed another &quot;non-residential building&quot; was hit in the second attack of Ukrainian drones on Oct. 19, causing no casualties. He said emergency responders were working at the scene. Ukrainian authorities had not commented on the attacks at the time of the publication. Ukrainian forces regularly conduct drone strikes and sabotage acts on Russian territory, targeting military assets, oil refineries, and industrial facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-electronics-plant-reportedly-on-fire-after-drone-strike-in-bryansk/	2024-10-19T01:54:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/------.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 677,180 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 675,800 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 18. This number includes 1,380 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,035 tanks, 18,072 armored fighting vehicles, 26,946 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,548 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,230 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-677-180-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-19T00:17:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123611407.jpg
Released activist Butkevych says prisoner swap was complete surprise	Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist Maksym Butkevych said he did not know he was going to be released in a prisoner swap until he was already in transit. Russia and Ukraine on Oct. 18 conducted their 58th prisoner exchange, involving 190 detainees, including Butkevych. The activist was serving a 13-year sentence in a Russian penal colony at the time of his release. The exchange came without warning, Butkevych told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. &quot;No, I didn&apos;t know, it was unexpected,&quot; he said. &quot;Yesterday morning, after the inspection, they told me that I was leaving in half an hour, but they didn&apos;t tell me where. Accordingly, I packed my things because I thought I was being transported, not for an exchange. We found out about the exchange by accident on the way. It was a double surprise.&quot; Butkevych was one of 95 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) returned on Oct. 18. The list also included 34 members of the Azov Regiment, who defended the southern city of Mariupol in the early months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Before the war, Butkevych worked with a Ukrainian NGO supporting internally displaced persons and with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ukraine. He enlisted in the Ukrainian military following the Feb. 2022 invasion. After being captured in the summer of 2022, a Russian-appointed court forced him to plead guilty to allegedly firing a grenade launcher at an apartment building. Russian-appointed authorities in occupied Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts sentenced Butkevych to 13 years in prison in March 2023, in what Amnesty International deemed &quot;a grave miscarriage of justice.&quot; Following his arrest, Butkevych&apos;s whereabouts were unknown for long periods of time until it was revealed that he was being held in a penal colony in Krasnyi Luch in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. Butkevych said his release proves that it is possible to free more imprisoned Ukrainians. &quot;I hope this will give hope to others,&quot; he said. &quot;I was released together with a colleague from a colony where more than 40 convicted prisoners of war are held on trumped-up cases. It is very important for them to know that this is possible and that the exchange is taking place.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/released-activist-butkevych-says-prisoner-swap-was-complete-surprise/	2024-10-18T20:55:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_125913478_2205a6ea-ff42-438d-adf7-c6b9ed1638d0.jpeg
Kursk Oblast conscripts among Russians returned in POW exchange, Russian org says	Many of the 95 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) exchanged in the latest Moscow-Kyiv prisoner swap were conscripts captured in Kursk Oblast, the Russian organization &quot;Our Way Out&quot; reported. Ukraine and Russia on Oct. 18 conducted their 58th prisoner exchange, with each side swapping 95 detainees. Prisoners returned to Ukraine include human rights activist Maksym Butkevych and 34 soldiers of the Azov Regiment. The returned Russian prisoners were mostly conscripts, many of whom were captured in Kursk Oblast, according to &quot;Our Way Out,&quot; an organization founded by Russian women to help families of POWs locate their relatives in Ukraine. The returned prisoners also reportedly included some mobilized Russian fighters and contract soldiers, including kadyrovtsy, the notoriously ruthless troops named for Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov. Ukrainian forces have controlled some parts of Kursk Oblast since launching a surprise cross-border incursion in early August. Along with occupying about 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory, Ukrainian troops captured hundreds of Russian soldiers in the region. Many of those captured in the Kursk incursion were conscripts, young men undergoing their mandatory 12 months of military service who never expected to see combat. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 6 that the Kursk incursion has proven one of the most significant contributions to Ukraine&apos;s prisoner exchange fund. The United Arab Emirates reportedly assisted in brokering the latest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia, which involved 190 prisoners. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Oct. 18 confirmed that 3,767 Ukrainian POWs have returned home since the start of the full-scale war. According to &quot;Our Way Out,&quot; 71 of the 95 returned Russians were located by relatives with the assistance of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, which has helped locate over 500 missing Russian soldiers. Ukraine&apos;s POW Coordination Headquarters launched the project in January as a sign of Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the principles of international humanitarian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-oblast-conscripts-among-russians-returned-in-pow-exchange-russian-org-says/	2024-10-18T19:17:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166353982.jpg
Russian troops have not gained foothold across canal in Chasiv Yar, military says	Russian forces have not &quot;managed to gain a foothold&quot; across the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 18. Bobovnikova&apos;s comments came after the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 17 that Russian forces had advanced in Chasiv Yar. &quot;I do not confirm the fact that Russian troops have managed to gain a foothold in the canal ... or anywhere in the direction of Chasiv Yar,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;The overall strategic position of the city remains under the control of Ukraine.&quot; Groups of Russian soldiers have, at times, crossed the canal and engaged in assault operations on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the city, Bobovnikova clarified. &quot;Given that the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, the enemy infantry runs behind the canal,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, such maneuvers are accompanied by significant losses for the Russians. Ukrainian forces quickly repel such attacks, pushing Russian units back.&quot; According to Bobovnikova, small groups of Russian soldiers have &quot;occupied&quot; buildings on the western side of the canal, but they are quickly flushed out by Ukrainian units. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the canal as the new front line. Russian troops set their sights on Chasiv Yar, which boasts natural elevation, after capturing Avdiivka in February. If Russian forces occupy the city completely, the higher ground could give them a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to about 12,000 people. By April 2024, around 700 people remained. In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-have-not-advanced-across-canal-in-chasiv-yar-military-says/	2024-10-18T18:09:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159884804.jpg
US offers $10 million reward for information on Russian media organization accused of election interference	The United States is providing a reward of up to $10 million for information that helps prevent or disrupts foreign election interference linked to the Russian state-sponsored Rybar media organization, the U.S. State Department announced. Rybar and its employees are accused of using social media to meddle in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The established bounty comes as the U.S. continues to crackdown on supposed Russian election interference. On Sept. 4, amid the presidential election campaign period, the U.S. announced sanctions against high-profile Russian propagandists like Margarita Simonyan and seized 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns. Rybar LLC, founded by the now deceased founder of Wagner PMC, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is a state-funded Russian media organization that is contracted by Russian state-owned arms manufacturer Rostec, according to the State Department&apos;s Rewards for Justice program. Rybar&apos;s employees manage multiple social media channels synonymous with conservative movements in the United States, including the #HOLDTHELINE and #STANDWTHTEXAS social media channels. Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Ryabr created the &quot;TEXASvsUSA&quot; channel on social media platform X, intended to &quot;exploit the issue of undocumented immigrants crossing the Texas border,&quot; the State Department said. Through the use of its latest social media channel, the State Department alleges that Rybar seeks &quot;to sow discord, promote social division, stoke partisan and racial discord, and encourage hate and violence in the United States.&quot; Rybar and its employees are included among a list of 8 individuals or entities that the State Department lists as having rewards associated with their capture. Russia has been accused of using social media disinformation, bot farms, and other means to back Donald Trump against his Democratic opponents &#x2013; Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden &#x2013; during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Trump is running for president a third time, and will face off against Vice President Kamala Harris in November. U.S. intelligence officials said they &quot;have not observed a shift in Russia&apos;s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-offers-10-million-reward-for-information-on-russian-media-organization-accused-of-election-interference/	2024-10-18T16:12:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2051572830.jpg
Human rights activist Maksym Butkevych among those returned in 190-person prisoner swap	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian human rights activist and serviceman, Maksym Butkevych, was among the 95 prisoners of war who were returned to Ukraine on Oct. 18, Butkevych&apos;s family confirmed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Oct. 18 that it had conducted a 95-for-95 prisoner exchange with Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the reported swap. No details were immediately available as to other POWs returned home to Ukraine. Nor was it immediately clear as which prisoners held by Ukraine were returned to Russia. The United Arab Emirates reportedly assisted in brokering the 190-person prisoner exchange. Human Rights Center ZMINA, the organization which Butkevych co-founded, announced Butkevych return from Russian captivity, where he has held since being captured in June 2022. Butkevych is a well-known human rights activist and journalist specializing in the protection of refugees. Before the war, Butkevych worked with a Ukrainian NGO supporting internally displaced persons, as well as at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ukraine. He decided to enlist in the Ukrainian military after the full-scale invasion. After being captured in the summer of 2022, a Russian-appointed court forced him to plead guilty to allegedly firing a grenade launcher at an apartment building. Russian-appointed authorities in occupied Luhansk and Donetsk sentenced Butkevych to 13 years in prison in March 2023, in what Amnesty International deemed as &quot;a grave miscarriage of justice.&quot; Following his arrest, Butkevych&apos;s whereabouts were unknown for long periods of time until it was revealed that he was being held in a penal colony in Krasnyi Luch in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. According to ZMINA, Butkevych is currently back on Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/human-rights-activist-maksym-butkevych-among-those-returned-in-95-person-prisoner-swap/	2024-10-18T13:38:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_125913478_2205a6ea-ff42-438d-adf7-c6b9ed1638d0.jpeg
Western leaders discuss Ukraine's victory plan, providing additional assistance at high-level talks in Germany, White House says	The leaders of the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom discussed Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan as well as plans to provide additional military and humanitarian assistance on Oct. 18 during high-level talks in Berlin, a readout by the White House said. The discussions on the victory plan comes just days after President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly unveiled the details of the plan, the with exception of three secret addenda that have been shared with international partners. No details were provided in the readout as to what specific additional assistance is in store for Ukraine, or on the outcome of their discussions on the victory plan. One of the key tenets of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan is an unconditional invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. While Western leaders have repeatedly said that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance at some point, a specific timetable for its accession has not been publicly clarified. Since the victory plan&apos;s unveiling to Western leaders, the plan has reportedly received a mixed reception from allies. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Oct. 2 that the plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps&quot; for progress. Ahead of the high-level meeting, U.S. President Joe Biden urged a continuation of Western support for Ukraine. &quot;We cannot let up. We must sustain our support. In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace consistent with the U.N. Charter,&quot; Biden said. The West must &quot;ensure that Ukraine prevails and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin fails and NATO remains strong and more united than ever,&quot; Biden added. Biden first held bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-leaders-discuss-ukraines-victory-plan-providing-additional-assistance-at-high-level-talks-in-germany-white-house-says/	2024-10-18T12:45:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178355670.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 11,000 North Korean troops will be 'ready to fight' in Ukraine by Nov. 1, Budanov says	Key developments on Oct. 18: Close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1, Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov said in comments published by the War Zone on Oct. 17. Budanov said the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, but further information is currently unknown. &quot;We don&apos;t have the full picture right now,&quot; Budanov said. Concerns about North Korea&apos;s direct involvement in Russia&apos;s full-scale war have reached a fever pitch in recent days. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent contacted the President&apos;s Office to ask about the discrepancy between Budanov&apos;s and Zelensky&apos;s figures, but had not received a response at the time of publication. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said on Oct. 18 that Pyongyang had recently decided to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including special forces, to support Russia&apos;s war effort. The NIS did not say if the troops had already been sent into the field or where they might be deployed. At the same time, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said on Oct. 17 that he &quot;can&apos;t confirm whether there are North Korean forces that have gone to Russia&quot; but added that the U.S. would &quot;continue to monitor&quot; the situation. If the reports were true, it would &quot;demonstrate the situation that Russia finds itself in, the dire situation that it finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;And so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military,&quot; Ryder added. Ukrainian forces have liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; the village of Kruhliakivka in Kharkiv Oblast of Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 18. The operation was carried out from Oct. 7-14 by special forces of the Bratstvo unit with the support of Ukraine&apos;s 77th Separate Airmobile Brigade. &quot;As a result of the operation, the enemy was driven out of the settlement, and the occupiers&apos; routes of movement were mined,&quot; the agency said. HUR described Kruhliakivka as important for the defense of Kupiansk, a crucial strategic town in Kharkiv Oblast, located just 40 kilometers from the Russian border.Recaptured by Ukraine in 2022, Kupiansk faced mounting pressure from Russian forces over the past months following Moscow&apos;s renewed Kharkiv offensive. Russian troops carried out 19 attacks in the sector over the past day, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. According to HUR, Russia lost more than a platoon of infantry (usually from 15 to 45 soldiers) during the recent operation. Ukrainian forces also reportedly took over Russian captives, having received &quot;important intelligence data.&quot; &quot;The enemy resisted, tried to counterattack, but was defeated. Intelligence soldiers repelled the occupiers&apos; assault and continued to push the enemy out,&quot; the agency added. U.S. President Joe Biden urged a continuation of Western support for Ukraine in Berlin on Oct. 18. The president had arrived earlier in the day for high-level talks with the leaders of Germany, the U.K., and France on Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. &quot;We cannot let up. We must sustain our support. In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace consistent with the U.N. Charter,&quot; Biden said. The West must &quot;ensure that Ukraine prevails and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin fails and NATO remains strong and more united than ever.&quot; Biden had previously canceled foreign trips to oversee recovery efforts after a series of devastating hurricanes hit the east coast of the U.S. &quot;Ready to greet old friends and strengthen our close alliance as we stand together for freedom and against tyranny around the world,&quot; Biden wrote on X, sharing a picture of his arrival in Berlin. Biden will first hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders. &quot;The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the trajectory of the war, how allies can best support Ukraine will be a subject of conversation,&quot; a senior U.S. official said ahead of Biden&apos;s trip. In a speech outside the presidential palace, Steinmeier thanked Biden for his role in helping stabilize the U.S.&apos;s role in NATO. &quot;When you were elected president, you restored Europe&#x2019;s hope in the transatlantic alliance literally overnight.&quot; Germany and the Netherlands detailed new packages of military assistance on Oct. 17 that have either already been delivered to Ukraine or are on their way soon. The Netherlands said it had ordered six self-propelled DITA howitzers from the Czech Republic to be sent to Ukraine, as well as an undisclosed number of 152mm artillery shells. Germany said it had handed over a new package of military equipment, which included eight Leopard 1 A5 main battle tanks, 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, four mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), one IRIS-T SLM air defense system, one IRIS-T SLS air defense system, six Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, as well as reconnaissance drones, demining equipment, and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery shells and other ammunition. The Danish Defense Ministry also announced a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine on Oct. 18. The package includes weapons from Denmark&apos;s stockpiles, funding for air defense systems with Germany, and contributions to the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine (IFU), according to the statement. Part of the funds will be used to expand training programs for the Ukrainian military. &quot;The government is working to make a decision on further procurement directly from the Ukrainian defense industry, including in the area of drones,&quot; Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. Ukraine is improving its interceptor drones as a substitute for anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian drone attacks, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 18. Syrskyi met with top commanders of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to discuss implementing innovations in the country&apos;s defense sector. He described Ukraine as the leader in the development of interceptor drones. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing modern warfare. Multiple videos have shown how Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) drones hit Russian reconnaissance drones and other costly equipment on the battlefield. &quot;My sincere gratitude goes to everyone who implements relevant solutions, assists, trains, and produces drones that intercept enemy UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),&quot; the general added. According to Syrskyi, the air command authorities have also begun to introduce automation systems that can help destroy Russian aerial targets more effectively. He outlines the protection of critical infrastructure by air defenses as one of the key tasks ahead of winter, as Ukrainian officials warn that Russia may resume strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector in the coming months. &quot;We continue to equip the Air Force with modern electronic warfare systems,&quot; Syrsyi said. &quot;This will increase the reliability of protection of facilities that are protected from air strikes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-37/	2024-10-18T12:03:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Video purportedly showing North Korean soldiers at Russian military camp published by Ukrainian agency	Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security published on Oct. 18 a video that purportedly shows North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp preparing to join Moscow&apos;s war effort against Ukraine. The footage was shared amid reports that Moscow plans to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory.

Western-made parts found in North Korean missile downed over Ukraine, report shows	The North Korean KN-23/24 missile launched by Russia at Ukraine in September contained components made by at least nine Western manufacturers, Ukraine&apos;s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO) said in its report published on Oct. 17. Microelectronics made by companies from the U.S., Switzerland, the U.K., and the Netherlands were found in the North Korean missile that was shot down near the villages of Myrne and Bilyky in Poltava Oblast. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks weapon supplies and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. According to the analysis, some of the components found in the KN-23/24 missile were produced between 2021 and 2023. Most of the microelectronic components have the markings of American companies, including Analog Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc., NAKO said. The non-governmental organization has reportedly examined over 2,500 components found in 30 pieces of Russian weapons and equipment since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Some 2,000 aircraft components were supplied mainly by the West, NAKO said. Russia has been adapting to Western sanctions, using smuggling and various schemes to acquire the sanctioned goods. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; Pyongyang in the war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-made-parts-found-in-north-korean-missile-downed-over-ukraine-report-shows/	2024-10-18T08:42:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1924859804.jpg

Ukraine retrieves bodies of 501 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 501 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Oct. 18. The Geneva Conventions dictate that people who lost their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. Over 2,800 bodies and body fragments of fallen soldiers were identified by Ukraine as of early March, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. According to the headquarters, the bodies of the 489 soldiers were retrieved from Donetsk Oblast, seven from Luhansk Oblast, and four from Zaporizhzhia Oblast. One more body was brought back from a morgue in Russia. &#x201C;After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a dignified burial,&#x201D; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The effort to retrieve the fallen soldiers was conducted in collaboration with several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late February that about 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-501-fallen-soldiers/	2024-10-18T06:45:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161908116.jpg
Polish PM Tusk says Zelensky's victory plan will be reassessed after US election	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 18 Ukraine&apos;s victory plan will be reassessed after the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Tusk said there is a lack of consensus among EU leaders regarding the plan, and it is difficult to tell how realistic it is because &quot;much depends on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.&quot; &quot;At the moment, we are waiting for the results of the U.S. election; no one is hiding it.&quot; Tusk emphasized that Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership has not changed &#x2014; &quot;We stand in solidarity with Ukraine on this issue,&quot; he said. The U.S. presidential election, which will pit Republican nominee Donald Trump against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, will be held on Nov. 5. The election is widely thought to have a significant impact on the level of U.S. support for Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the plan privately to Western leaders in September and made it public earlier in October. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. While Ukraine&apos;s Western allies have largely said that Ukraine will join NATO, a specific timeline on when that might happen has not been made public &#x2014; or agreed upon. Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said on Oct. 16 there is no immediate plan to invite Ukraine to join the alliance. Smith said, &quot;Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership,&quot; but added, &quot;We are not at the stage where (NATO) is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term.&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz was less optimistic about the victory plan. In comments to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), Kosiniak-Kamysz said, &quot;Everyone would like the victory plan to be implemented in their hearts.&quot; &quot;But there is no great enthusiasm either &#x2014; as I hear &#x2014; in the European Council or in NATO headquarters because the situation on the front is difficult, there is enormous war fatigue.&quot; As a result, the victory plan &quot;is not a clear, bright light that will immediately change reality,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz added.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-says-victory-plan-will-be-reassessed-after-us-election/	2024-10-18T05:56:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178154352.jpg
Russia suffers 2nd deadliest day since start of full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine's military	Russian forces on Oct. 17 suffered their second deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released by Kyiv. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported 1,530 Russian casualties over the past day, a figure only surpassed once in more than two-and-a-half years of fighting. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. Russian casualty figures have surged in recent months. According to an analysis of the Ukrainian figures by analyst Ragnar Gudmundsson, two of the top ten bloodiest days for Moscow&apos;s forces since the launch of the full-scale invasion occurred this month &#x2014; 1,530 on Oct. 17, and 1,450 on Oct. 16. Three others all occurred last month &#x2013; Sept. 22, with 1,500 casualties, Sept. 28, with 1,470, and Sept. 21, with 1,440. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; according to a U.K. military intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day, and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion was &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; Steven Wolff, Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent last month that Russia&apos;s huge losses are indicative of a Russian military mindset that has not changed in decades. &quot;Russian military doctrine is Soviet-style, and it always relied on the depth of Russia and its enormous resources, including manpower resources,&quot; he said. &quot;The way in which (Soviet leader Joseph) Stalin just threw millions of people at the Nazis in the 1940s, it&apos;s not very different to what (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does in this terrible war of aggression against Ukraine.&quot; In order to sustain this pool of manpower, Putin earlier this month signed a decree increasing the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000, to just under 2.4 million.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-suffers-2nd-deadliest-day-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-according-to-ukraines-military/	2024-10-18T05:09:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1248375324-1.jpg

Germany said it had handed over a new package of military equipment, which included eight Leopard 1 A5 main battle tanks, 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, four mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), one IRIS-T SLM air defense system, one IRIS-T SLS air defense system, six Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, as well as reconnaissance drones, demining equipment, and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery shells and other ammunition. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin became Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Germany and the Netherlands have allocated 15 billion euros ($16.2 billion) and 6.4 billion euros ($6.9 billion), respectively.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-netherlands-detail-new-military-equipment-being-sent-to-ukraine/	2024-10-18T02:26:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575198.jpg
North Korean troops preparing to help Russia's war in Ukraine a 'grave security threat,' says South Korea	North Korean troops being sent to Russia to assist its war in Ukraine is a &quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community, South Korea&apos;s presidential office said on Oct. 18. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol convened an emergency meeting with key officials a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pyongyang is preparing 10,000 soldiers of different branches and specializations to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;The participants ... shared the view that the current situation where Russia and North Korea&apos;s closer ties have gone beyond the movement of military supplies to actual dispatch of troops is a grave security threat not only to our country but to the international community,&quot; South Korea&apos;s presidential office said in a statement after the meeting. &quot;They also decided not to stand by and will respond by mobilizing all available means in cooperation with the international community,&quot; it added. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. After the meeting on Oct. 18, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totalling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including special forces. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Oct. 17, Zelensky said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. His statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. Zelensky said the participation of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war &quot;is the first step to a World War.&quot; Elsewhere, the White House said on Oct. 17 it &quot;can&#x2019;t confirm or corroborate&quot; whether North Korean troops had been dispatched to Russian in preparation of fighting in Ukraine. &quot;If true, that would demonstrate an increase in the cooperation between Russia and North Korea,&quot; U.S. Department of Defense Press Secretary Gen. Patrick Ryder said at a press briefing. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-preparing-to-help-russias-war-in-ukraine-a-grave-security-threat-says-south-korea/	2024-10-18T02:14:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157615883.jpg
European Council says Russian assets should remain frozen until end of war, payment of reparations	The European Council said on Oct. 17 frozen Russian assets should &quot;remain immobilized&quot; until Moscow ends its full-scale war on Ukraine and makes reparations for damages caused to the country. Estimates of the damage that Russian aggression over the past decade has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure have varied. The World Bank said in February 2024 it could be as high as $486 billion. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the EU devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. The European Council reiterated it would adhere to the &quot;security and defense policy&quot; of &quot;certain member states&quot; regarding the use of revenues generated from the frozen assets, and added it would continue to &quot;address all relevant legal and financial aspects.&quot; EU ambassadors agreed earlier in October on a plan to issue a 35-billion-euro ($37.2 billion) loan to support Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy. The agreement followed Hungary&apos;s announcement it would block a key sanctions reform until after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The deal is part of a broader G7 initiative to provide &#x20AC;45 billion ($50 billion) in aid to Kyiv, struggling to counter a renewed Russian offensive that has severely damaged its power infrastructure. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-council-says-russian-assets-should-remain-frozen-until-end-of-war-payment-of-reparations/	2024-10-18T01:35:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1497199866.jpg
Romania, Belarus scramble jets amid mass Russian drone attack on Ukraine	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said on Oct. 18 it had shot down 80 out of 135 Russian drones launched at the country overnight. Amid the mass attack, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said it had scrambled jets as an unidentified aerial object approached, and then entered its territory before radar lost track of it near the town of Amzacea, some 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of the Ukrainian border. Both the Ukrainian Air Force and the Belarusian monitoring group Hajun said two drones had flown toward the Belarusian border. Hajun said Belarusian jets had been scrambled in response. The Air Force said beyond the 80 drones that were shot down across the country, another 44 were &quot;lost,&quot; possibly downed by means of electronic warfare. There were no reports of possible damage caused by falling debris or potential successful hits. It was not the first time that Romanian and Bulgarian jets have been scrambled amid Russian attacks on Ukraine. Debris from Russian missiles and drones have also been found in the territory of neighboring countries on numerous occasions.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-belarus-scramble-jets-amid-mass-russian-drone-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-10-18T00:44:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1619864803.jpg
Biden arrives in Germany for high-level talks on Ukraine, Middle East	U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Berlin on Oct. 18 for high-level talks with the leaders of Germany, the U.K., and France on Russia&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Biden had previously canceled foreign trips to oversee recovery efforts after a series of devastating hurricanes hit the east coast of the U.S. &quot;Ready to greet old friends and strengthen our close alliance as we stand together for freedom and against tyranny around the world,&quot; the president wrote on X. Biden will first hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders. &quot;The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the trajectory of the war, how allies can best support Ukraine will be a subject of conversation,&quot; a senior U.S. official said ahead of Biden&apos;s trip. There has been intense speculation &#x2014; as well as concern &#x2014; about how next month&apos;s presidential election could impact U.S. support for Ukraine. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he would &quot;get out&quot; of the war, while Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to maintain U.S. assistance. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Ukraine and its Western allies have acknowledged the crucial role that the U.S. has played in supporting Kyiv as its largest provider of aid since the beginning of the full-scale war. On Oct. 16, Scholz emphasized to the German parliament that &quot;Germany and the U.S are the biggest supporters of Ukraine in defense of its sovereignty and integrity and its democracy. And we will continue to be so.&quot; &quot;But this is a time when, in addition to our clear support for Ukraine, we must also do everything we can to find out how we can ensure that this war does not go on forever, that it does not continue to kill an unbelievable amount of women and men.&quot; Discussions on Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, which President Volodymyr Zelensky shared behind closed doors with allies in recent weeks and made public on Oct. 16, are also expected. One of the key tenets of the plan is an unconditional invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. While Western leaders have repeatedly said that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance at some point, a specific timetable for its accession has not been publicly clarified. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-arrives-in-germany-for-high-level-talks-on-ukraine-middle-east/	2024-10-17T23:31:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GaIhKJXWwAAUra3.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 675,800 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 675,800 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 18. This number includes 1,530 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,027 tanks, 18,053 armored fighting vehicles, 26,908 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,533 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,152 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-675-800-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-17T22:24:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163893481.jpg
Two Russian nationals face charges for distributing Wagner Group flyers in Krakow	The Krakow District Court has begun the trial of two Russian nationals, Andrei G. and Aleksei T., who were allegedly hired by the Wagner Group to distribute flyers in Krakow, Poland encouraging people to join the organization. They face charges related to foreign intelligence activities and involvement with an international armed group intending to commit acts of terrorism. Initially arrested by Poland&apos;s Internal Security Agency in August 2023, they could face up to 10 years in prison for their actions. Aside from Poland, they supposedly also worked in other cities in Europe including Berlin and Paris, also hanging flyers and distributing stickers with QR codes for enlistment. &quot;We received the Wagner Group flyers in Moscow. Our task was to distribute 3,000 flyers in Krakow and Warsaw, but we only managed to post 200. We were also told to take photos of them once they were up. I didn&#x2019;t want to be part of the propaganda; I was just looking to earn some money,&quot; one of the men stated in court. The Wagner Group played a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading Moscow&apos;s assault in the Battle of Bakhmut in the spring of 2023. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the then-leader of Wagner, died in a mysterious plane crash in Russia on Aug. 23, 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led Wagner troops in a short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin. Following Prigozhin&apos;s mutiny and death, the mercenary group withdrew from Ukraine and became fragmented, operating in Belarus and some African nations friendly to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-russian-nationals-face-charges-for-distributing-wagner-group-flyers-in-krakow/	2024-10-17T22:09:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1623017480.jpg
Ukraine urges international support in landmine clearance efforts at Swiss conference	At the annual Ukraine Mine Action Conference, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal urged the international community to increase support for demining efforts, during his address in Lausanne, Switzerland on Oct. 17. The conference, which is taking place from Oct. 17-18, aims to receive financial backing for demining projects from officials of over 50 countries in attendance. The estimated cost for demining is $34.6 billion, according to a World Bank study, and clearing these areas is crucial for restoring agricultural production and enabling millions of displaced Ukrainians to return. &quot;The scale of this challenge is truly massive,&quot; Shmyhal said, and highlighted the need for training 10,000 deminers and developing machines that can speed up the process. Mock-up scenarios are being shown to attendees to illustrate the risks posed by mines, and new demining technologies, such as AI-powered drones and remote-controlled machines, are being showcased. Ukraine also remains the world&#x2019;s most mined country. The country&apos;s Defense Ministry specialists have cleared 30,000 square kilometers of mines over the past two years - an area comparable to the size of Belgium or Moldova. 399 civilians have been killed and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Since 2022, approximately 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian land have been contaminated with explosives, making 144,000 square kilometers still potentially dangerous.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-urges-international-support-in-landmine-clearance-efforts-at-annual-swiss-conference/	2024-10-17T20:46:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Norway announces more than $270 million in aid for Ukraine's energy sector	Norway has increased its total support for Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector to 3 billion kroner (around $274.2 million) as part of its broader aid plan, according to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes 1.5 billion kroner ($117 million) newly allocated for preparing Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure for winter. &quot;We are working to provide more support in the energy sector and look forward to bringing more good news to our Ukrainian friends during the autumn and winter,&quot; Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. Of the remaining amount, 1.1 billion kroner ($86 million) will be used for energy equipment purchases via the UN Development Program, 500 million kroner ($39 million) will go to the World Bank&apos;s Budget Support Facility, and 740 million kroner ($58 million) is designated for humanitarian aid to help Ukrainians prepare for the winter. This energy aid comes days after Norway&#x2019;s government announced an allocation of up to 967 million kroner (around $87.5 million) to enhance its defense industry, with a focus on supporting Ukraine. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-announces-more-than-270-million-in-aid-for-ukraines-energy-sector/	2024-10-17T19:22:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1636214818.jpg
Orban calls Zelensky's victory plan 'more than terrifying,' urges negotiations with Russia	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan &quot;more than terrifying&quot; in a social media post published Oct. 17. Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to the European Council in Brussels on Oct. 17, one day after unveiling the plan to the public during a special session of Ukraine&apos;s parliament. &#xA0; &quot;What (Zelensky) outlined yesterday in the Ukrainian parliament is more than terrifying,&quot; Orban wrote on Facebook ahead of the EU summit. Orban urged the EU to change its strategy regarding the war in Ukraine and reiterated calls for &quot;a ceasefire and peace talks.&quot; Under Orban&apos;s leadership, Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. Since taking the presidency of the European Commission in July, Orban has lobbied aggressively to stand as a negotiator between Ukraine and Russia. Orban dismissed Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, which calls for more long-range weapons and the permission to use them against Russian targets, as &quot;dangerous.&quot; The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. The EU must &quot;switch to a peace strategy instead of a war strategy,&quot; Orban said in his post, which also insisted that Ukraine was &quot;losing&quot; the war against Russia. &#xA0; &quot;I will also urge today that the German Chancellor and the French President start negotiations with Russia as soon as possible on behalf of the entire European Union, so that we can find a way out of this situation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-calls-zelenskys-victory-plan-terrifying-urges-negotiations-with-russia/	2024-10-17T16:29:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2159990634.jpg
Trump blames Zelensky, Biden for Russia's invasion of Ukraine	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed U.S. and Ukrainian leadership, rather than Russian President Vladimir Putin, for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine during a podcast interview released on Oct. 17. The comments come three weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, a race which may determine the future of Washington&apos;s military support for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden &quot;instigated the war,&quot; Trump told podcast host Patrick Bet-David, saying he &quot;largely blames&quot; Biden for the invasion. Trump also complained about President Volodymyr Zelensky and the amount of military aid Washington has provided to Kyiv. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t want to help them because I feel very badly for those people. But (Zelensky) should never have let that war start,&quot; he said. &quot;That war&apos;s a loser.&quot; Trump claimed Russia would not have launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022 if he had been president at the time. &quot;This should&apos;ve been settled before it started,&quot; he said. &quot;It would&apos;ve been so easy. If we had a president with half a brain, it would&apos;ve been easy to settle.&quot; Trump has made similar comments repeatedly during his campaign, insisting the war would not have happened on his watch while withholding concrete details on a plan to achieve peace now. While Trump was quick to blame Zelensky and Biden for the war, he made no mention of Putin during the interview. The omission is particularly glaring in light of recent claims that Trump held several secret phone conversations with Putin after leaving office in 2021. Trump has denied the allegations, leveled by journalist Bob Woodward in his new book &quot;War,&quot; calling them &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; Despite these denials, Trump on Oct. 15 declined to confirm whether or not he had spoken to Putin after leaving the White House. &quot;If I did, it&apos;s a smart thing... If I&apos;m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that&apos;s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country,&quot; he said. The U.S. in September launched a sweeping crackdown against Russian election interference, alleging that the Kremlin spearheaded a propaganda campaign to reduce support for Ukraine and influence the November vote in favor of Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-blames-zelensky-biden-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/	2024-10-17T14:37:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173788651.jpg
Ukraine not developing nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is not planning to develop weapons of mass destruction and remains committed to nuclear non-proliferation, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said in a statement issued Oct. 17. The statement came after the German media outlet Bild reported that Kyiv is preparing to develop nuclear weapons. The story cited an unnamed Ukrainian source. &quot;We officially refute the insinuations of unnamed sources in the Bild publication regarding Ukraine&apos;s alleged plans to develop weapons of mass destruction,&quot; Tykhyi&apos;s statement read. &quot;Ukraine has been and remains a committed party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)... having renounced the world&apos;s third-most powerful military nuclear capability. Ukraine, which has made the greatest contribution to international peace, security and nuclear non-proliferation in history, is now facing nuclear blackmail from the terrorist state of Russia.&quot; Earlier on Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in September that Ukraine must either join NATO or pursue nuclear capabilities for protection. Zelensky then clarified the comments, saying that Ukraine is not pursuing nuclear weapons and the remarks were made to emphasize the failures of the Budapest Memorandum. Under the 1994 agreement, referenced in the Foreign Ministry&apos;s statement, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for receiving security guarantees from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. &quot;Ukraine is convinced that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the global international security architecture,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement said. &quot;Despite the ongoing Russian aggression, Ukraine continues to comply with the provisions of the NPT and remains a responsible participant in the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-developing-weapons-of-mass-destruction-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-10-17T13:36:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1983501762.jpg
US revising F-16 training to focus on younger pilots, WSJ reports	The United States is shifting the focus of its F-16 training program for Ukrainian pilots to prioritize younger trainees, potentially delaying the Ukrainian squadron&apos;s readiness to fight, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 17. The U.S. and other allies have been training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s at an acclerated pace due to Kyiv&apos;s urgent need for air defense against intensifying Russian bombardments. The shortened training came under scrutiny after an F-16 pilot was killed in a crash during a Russian attack in August. While the initial instruction program focused on experienced Ukrainian pilots, lack of requisite English-language abilities and difficulties adapting to Western-style training have prompted a shift to younger pilots, U.S. officials told the WSJ. &quot;It is a mix,&quot; a senior Pentagon official told the WSJ regarding the makeup of the Ukrainian trainees. &quot;Some have been experienced pilots, and we still are receiving more experienced pilots. But there&apos;s also those that do not have that kind of pilot training and experience.&quot; Those with experience flying Soviet-era fighter jets are able to skip basic flight training and take the accelerated course, while newer cadets must spend a year training as pilots before moving to the F-16 training bases in the U.S. and Romania. Shifting to younger pilots could thus extend the F-16 training program by months, delaying the Ukrainian squadron&apos;s battlefield readiness even further as Russian attacks continue to pummel the nation&apos;s energy grid and civilian neighborhoods. According to a person with knowledge of the F-16 program, even before the shift, Ukraine would not likely have a full squadron of F-16s until spring or summer of 2025 at the earliest. Only 11 F-16 pilots are currently flying in Ukraine, though&#xA0;a full squadron consists of 40. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July, one year after Denmark, the Netherlands, and other foreign partners launched a fighter jet coalition for Kyiv. The pace of the training program came into question after a recently delivered F-16 operated by Ukraine&apos;s top pilot, Oleksii Mes, crashed while defending against a Russian drone and missile attack on Aug. 26. Mes, call sign &quot;Moonfish,&quot; was killed in the crash. &quot;To get an experienced pilot, you need an experienced pilot. That&apos;s just a fact of life,&quot; David Deptula, the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, told the WSJ. &quot;You don&#x2019;t come out of elementary school and become an Olympic athlete in a couple of months.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-revising-f-16-training-to-focus-on-younger-pilots-wsj-reports/	2024-10-17T13:02:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218556.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky says he told Trump that either Ukraine will join NATO or pursue nuclear weapons	Key developments on Oct. 17: President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in their meeting in September that Ukraine would either become a NATO member or pursue nuclear capabilities to protect itself. Zelensky was speaking from Brussels, where he presented his victory plan to EU leaders. &quot;Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance. Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance,&quot; Zelensky said that he had told Trump. &quot;I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,&quot; he added. Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war. At the same time, Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that Ukraine was not pursuing nuclear weapons, clarifying comments he had made previously. Earlier in the day, Zelensky said that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in their meeting in September that Ukraine needs to be part of NATO, or it would pursue nuclear capabilities to protect itself. In a press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Zelensky walked back the comments and said explicitly that Ukraine was not seeking nuclear weapons. &quot;We never spoke about...that we are preparing to create nuclear weapons or something like this,&quot; he said. Zelensky chided the reporter for asking about the earlier comments and said they were made to describe how the Budapest Memorandum had failed to provide Ukraine with an effective security umbrella. Zelensky emphasized that, given the failure of the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine has no other option for effective security besides joining NATO. &quot;But we don&apos;t do...nuclear weapons,&quot; he emphasized, adding that he would ask for such a narrative not to be propagated. Following Zelensky&apos;s comments, Rutte reiterated that Ukraine will become a NATO member but did not specify a timetable for when it would join. North Korea is preparing 10,000 soldiers of different branches and specializations to join Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17. His statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, the president said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. According to Zelensky, the participation of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war &quot;is the first step to a world war.&quot; Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. Iran is another Russian ally, aiding Moscow in its aggression against Ukraine. Tehran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones that are used for daily attacks across Ukraine. &quot;Iran gave (Russia) drones, license to produce these drones and missiles. But not people, not officially. And here we see this first step in this war,&quot; Zelensky added. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia in a speech at the Chatham House on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. Zaluzhnyi reiterated that back in 2023, the West did not provide Kyiv with a sufficient number of weapons, which is why Ukraine failed to achieve &quot;significant success in defeating Russia&quot; during the counteroffensive. &quot;Consequentially, we ended up in a state of protracted war. In my personal opinion, a way out of this protracted war seems...almost impossible,&quot; he said. In November 2023, The Economist published an interview with Zaluzhnyi and an op-ed by the general, in which he characterized the state of the war as a &quot;stalemate.&quot; The comment contrasted the outlook usually offered by President Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration in public comments and reportedly triggered a discord between the two. Zaluzhnyi warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine was moving to a &quot;positional&quot; stage. This new stage is characterized by &quot;static and attritional fighting&quot; that will allow Russia to restore its military power. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Nikita Klenkov, a deputy commander of a unit for Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU), was shot dead in Moscow Oblast by an unknown assailant, Russian media reported on Oct. 16. Klenkov, 44, was reportedly the deputy commander of GRU unit 43292, which serves as training center for Special Operations Forces, the Moscow Times reported. Russian Telegram channel Baza reported that Klenkov was shot at on the side of a road in the town of Melenki, east of Moscow. The assailant reportedly fire eight shots from the window of a car. According to the Russian state-run media outlet TASS, Klenkov &quot;returned home a week ago&quot; from Ukraine&apos;s front line, according to a GRU source. Russian state media reported that an investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify any of the reports in Russian state media. It is currently unclear if the attack was intended as a politically-motivated assassination. Kyiv has not commented on the situation. In July, another officer from Russia&apos;s GRU had his feet blown off in a car bomb attack in Moscow. Kyiv denied any involvement in that attack. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told independent Russian media he believed there was &quot;a malfunction with the gas equipment in the car.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-36/	2024-10-17T12:20:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
Ukraine signs bilateral security agreement with Greece	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Zelensky said on Oct. 17. Ukraine has already signed 25 similar agreements, including with the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France, aimed at helping Kyiv repel Russia&apos;s aggression amid the full-scale war. These agreements are based on a pledge made by the Group of Seven (G7) in July 2022. &quot;Greece is ready to continue meeting Ukraine&apos;s most urgent defense needs,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;(Greece) will also provide additional resources to accelerate F-16 training for our pilots and technicians,&quot; he added. Despite conflicting reports and pressure from the EU, Greece said in April 2024 that it would not send Ukraine either Patriots or S-300 air defense systems, despite these requests and Ukraine&apos;s critical air defense shortage. &quot;Greece supported Ukraine in various ways, with defense materials,&quot; Mitsotakis said at the time. &quot;But we said from the first moment that we cannot get rid of the weapons systems that are of crucial importance for our deterrence capabilities.&quot; Mitsotakis said that sending the equipment to Ukraine would pose too great of a risk to Greek air security. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Greece has allocated 137 million euros ($148 million) in assistance as of August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-signs-bilateral-security-agreement-with-greece/	2024-10-17T07:19:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GaFxWqfXcAA2qaO.jpeg
Zelensky says he told Trump that either Ukraine will join NATO or pursue nuclear weapons	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in their meeting in September that Ukraine needs to be part of NATO, or it would pursue nuclear capabilities to protect itself. Zelensky was speaking from Brussels, where he presented his victory plan to EU leaders. &quot;Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance. Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance,&quot; Zelensky said that he had told Trump. &quot;I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,&quot; he added. Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war. At the same time, Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-he-told-trump-that-either-ukraine-will-join-nato-or-pursue-nuclear-weapons/	2024-10-17T06:40:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
Zelensky signs bill on customs reform into law	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 17 signed a bill reforming the State Customs Service and introduced to tackle corruption and save funds otherwise lost to smuggling. After the presidential signature, the law will enter into force on Nov. 1. The legislation, approved by the parliament last month, was pushed through after prolonged pressure from Western partners and Ukrainian business associations. The reform is also a necessary step toward Kyiv&apos;s accession to the EU. Ukraine&apos;s Customs Service has been described as the &quot;biggest cash cow&quot; and the &quot;largest tax-evasion scheme in the country&quot; as smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year, the Kyiv Independent reported on Oct. 14. Ukrainians view the State Customs Service as the most corrupt institution in the country, with previous attempts at reforms falling flat. As one of the key changes under the bill, the new head of the service will be selected by an independent committee, half of which will consist of independent experts. The new chief will be able to choose his deputies. The legislation also includes audits by external experts, a one-time vetting of all the current employees, and greater independence from the Foreign Ministry. The law aims not only to reform the institution but also to bring more funds into state budget as Ukraine faces a deficit of $35 billion next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-bill-on-customs-reform/	2024-10-17T06:12:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242569002.jpg
First step to World War' — North Korea preparing 10,000 soldiers to join Russia's war, Zelensky confirms	North Korea is preparing 10,000 soldiers of different branches and specializations to join Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17. His statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, the president said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. According to Zelensky, the participation of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war &quot;is the first step to a World War.&quot; Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. Iran is another Russian ally, aiding Moscow in its aggression against Ukraine. Tehran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones that are used for daily attacks across Ukraine. &quot;Iran gave (Russia) drones, license to produce these drones and missiles. But not people, not officially. And here we see this first step in this war,&quot; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-preparing-10-000-soldiers/	2024-10-17T05:50:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178140212.jpg
NATO armies built on Korean War-era military principles, Zaluzhnyi says	The militaries of NATO member states continue to rely on security principles and weapons &quot;inherited from the Korean War&quot; that will not be relevant in modern warfare, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;There will be no war of the 1953 model. I am talking about the Korean War. It ended in summer 2023 in Ukraine, when two professional armies of more than a million personnel each faced each other on the battlefield,&quot; the retired general said at Chatham House in London. When Zaluzhnyi was in charge of Ukraine&apos;s army in 2023, the Ukrainian military launched its counteroffensive aimed at pushing toward the Sea of Azov to cut Russia&apos;s land corridor to Crimea. Failing to reach its goals, it was limited to the liberation of a few villages in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, significantly slowed down by Russian minefields and a lack of air superiority and equipment. Since then, the near-complete saturation of the front line with drones and other unmanned system has continued to change how the war is fought. The ambassador also stressed that modern warfare brought new technologies to the battlefield, such as drones and artificial intelligence. Zaluzhnyi noted that it is impossible to produce expensive missiles, fighter jets, and aircraft carriers at the &quot;massive scale&quot; that modern warfare requires, meaning these systems will become less efficient. South Korea and the U.S. fought against North Korea and China in a bloody war in 1950-53, leading to a ceasefire and a division along the demarcation line that stands today. In the same speech, Zaluzhnyi said that it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/global-security-wont-hold-on-korean-war-principles-in-future-zaluzhnyi-says/	2024-10-17T04:54:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174412815.jpg
Ukraine's draft system burdened with Soviet heritage, fixing it will take time, Zaluzhnyi says	Ukraine had to change its approach to mobilization to remove Soviet influences, but more time is needed for a proper reform, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluzhyni said at an event on Oct. 17 in response to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;Unfortunately, we don&apos;t have the luxury of time, so we have to resort to certain limitations. In a democratic society, all of this is perceived as very controversial,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief said in a speech at the Chatham House in London. Ukraine passed updated legislation on mobilization this spring in an effort to replenish its military ranks as the all-out war with Russia has been ongoing for over two and half years. Responding to a question from the Kyiv Independent on Ukrainian internal plans during Zaluzhyni&apos;s military tenure and their implementation, the ambassador acknowledged that Ukraine had made a number of mistakes dating back many years. &quot;As we change our country, mentality... &#xA0;(and we) order our country on a democratic basis, we had to change our approach to mobilization as well,&quot; Zaluzhyni noted. The retired general said that the mobilization system is still influenced by the Soviet heritage and &quot;actually dates as far back as the times of Peter the Great.&quot; &quot;We will be able to change that only when we have enough time... to bring up a whole generation which, without any interference from the state, will take up arms and go defend their home.&quot; In late 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military, then under Zaluzhnyi&apos;s command, requested drafting 450,000-500,000 people in the face of a prolonged war. Zaluzhyni later denied this figure. Uncertainties over mobilization and Zaluzhnyi&apos;s sobering statements for the media regarding the war contributed to the growing tensions between the two, with Zelensky eventually replacing the chief commander this February. In his speech, Zaluzhyni also warned that Russia will seek to misuse any possible tensions as it wages war in the &quot;informational and cognitive space,&quot; making the &quot;mobilization drive even more difficult.&quot; The accelerated mobilization push has contributed to social tensions within Ukraine, already aggravated by years of Russian attacks, energy deficits, and economic challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-on-mobilization/	2024-10-17T04:43:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2162421049.jpg
Getting out of 'protracted' war with Russia 'almost impossible,' Zaluzhnyi says	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia in a speech at the Chatham House on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. Zaluzhnyi reiterated that back in 2023, the West did not provide Kyiv with a sufficient number of weapons, which is why Ukraine failed to achieve &quot;significant success in defeating Russia&quot; &#xA0;during the counteroffensive. &quot;Consequentially, we ended up in a state of protracted war. In my personal opinion, a way out of this protracted war seems... almost impossible,&quot; he said. In November 2023, The Economist magazine published an interview with Zaluzhnyi and an op-ed by the general, in which he characterized the state of the war as a &quot;stalemate.&quot; The comment contrasted the outlook usually offered by President Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration in public comments and reportedly triggered a discord between the two. Zaluzhnyi warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine was moving to a &quot;positional&quot; stage. This new stage is characterized by &quot;static and attritional fighting&quot; that will allow Russia to restore its military power. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-protracted-war/	2024-10-17T03:14:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
Victory plan includes Western-supplied missile package to force Russia to talks, Zelensky says in Brussels	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that the victory plan includes placing conventional missile capabilities in Ukraine that would either force Russia to accept negotiations or decimate Moscow&apos;s military targets. &quot;We propose placing on Ukrainian land a deterrence package that would either force Russia to participate in real negotiations or could allow the destruction of its military targets,&quot; Zelensky said when presenting the plan to the European Council in Brussels on Oct. 17. Ukraine&apos;s head of state arrived in Brussels a day after unveiling most of the five-point plan to the public in a speech in the Ukrainian parliament. The third point relates to a &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; positioned on Ukrainian territory. &quot;It&apos;s the peace-through-strength approach,&quot; Zelensky said, explaining this concerns a missile package obtained with the support of the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy. He did not specify what exact weapons systems Kyiv seeks in this context. Washington, London, and Paris have provided Ukraine with long-range missiles like ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP/T but did not permit their use within Russian territory. Lifting these restrictions was also one of the points included in the victory plan. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin should respect our strength, not have the free world tremble at his threats.&quot; According to the president, Ukraine would use the deterrence package only if Moscow did not give up on its war of aggression. During his address, Zelensky presented the victory plan&apos;s remaining four points, which concern an immediate invitation to NATO, defense support, economic cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The president called for sustained support from European partners &quot;because Putin is preparing his reinforcements to continue the war.&quot; &quot;Putin wants to match your country&apos;s ammunition production by next year,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Moscow is receiving assistance from North Korea and Iran, among others. &quot;We are receiving signals that China is actively helping Russia drag out this war,&quot; the president said, citing &quot;clear intelligence data.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/victory-plan-deterrence/	2024-10-17T02:43:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215.jpg
Russian ships ineffective for missile strikes, used to distract Ukraine's defenses, Navy says	Russia is forced to use its warships to distract Ukraine&apos;s air defense during mass missile attacks as the vessels are not very effective in launching the strikes themselves, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said on Oct. 17. Russia has fired missiles against Ukraine from warships stationed in the Black and Azov seas. In recent weeks, Russia ramped up its attacks against port infrastructure and civilian vessels in southern Odesa Oblast, launching attacks from occupied Crimea. Speaking on national television, Pletenchuk said that when Russia deploys several cruise missile carriers to the sea, it does not mean they will be used for an attack. &quot;Because of the low effectiveness of these weapons systems, (Russia) was forced, at the moment, to use them more to distract air defenses during mass missile attacks,&quot; he said. According to the spokesperson, when one or two Russian submarines are at sea, they usually do not perform tasks related to missile launches but guard the base. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military. Successful Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea forced Moscow to pull out much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian city of Novorossiysk, which became a key port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-warships-missile-strikes/	2024-10-17T01:58:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1564923593.webp
Zelensky arrives in Brussels to pitch Ukraine's victory plan to European Council	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels on Oct. 17 to present his five-point victory plan to the European Council and meet its president, Charles Michel. &quot;All European leaders will hear how our positions must be strengthened. We must end this war fairly,&quot; Zelensky said in a video message from a plane on his way to Belgium. The Ukrainian president arrived in Brussels only a day after unveiling the plan to the public during a special session in Ukraine&apos;s parliament. He has previously pitched the plan to the U.S., U.K., German, French, and Italian leaders to drum up allied support before the uncertain U.S. election. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. After meeting EU leaders, Zelensky will meet top European Parliament officials and participate in a ministerial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-brussels-to-pitch-victory-plan-to-european-council/	2024-10-17T01:43:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158896695.jpg

US, South Korea, Japan launch multinational group to monitor North Korea sanctions	The U.S., South Korea, and Japan launched a new multinational group to monitor the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, Reuters reported on Oct. 16. The move came after Russia and China blocked monitoring activities at the United Nations. In March, Moscow vetoed the annual renewal of the panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) is a multilateral mechanism to monitor and report violations and evasions of the sanction measures stipulated in the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, the U.S. Department of State said. &quot;The goal of the new mechanism is to assist the full implementation of U.N. sanctions on (North Korea) by publishing information based on rigorous inquiry into sanctions violations and evasion attempts,&quot; the statement read. A number of nations said they are open to dialogue and called on other states to join in maintaining international security in the face of ongoing threats from North Korea. The U.N. Security Council adopted several sanctions against North Korea in 2006 to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, while the expert panel was created in 2009. Moscow&apos;s veto halts the work of the panel but does not cancel the sanctions themselves. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused Pyongyang of sending personnel to support Russia and said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it is unclear in what capacity.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-south-korea-japan-to-monitor-north-korea-sanctions-under-new-multinational-group/	2024-10-17T00:37:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1139833730.jpg
German fighter jets scrambled due to Russian spy plane over Baltic Sea	Germany&apos;s Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft were scrambled due to a flight of a Russian Il-20 reconnaissance plane over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, the German Air Force said on Oct. 16. Such incidents are a common occurrence in the region, as Russia is suspected of using the aircraft to spy on the alliance&apos;s positions. The Russian aircraft, flying with switched-off communications and without a flight plan, reportedly ended up in an area between the German town of Rugen and the Danish town of Bornholm. In response, two Eurofighter jets took off from the Rostock-Laage airfield in northeastern Germany to &quot;establish a visual contact,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported. The German jets &quot;escorted the Russian reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea,&quot; the German Air Force said. Six other Russian aircraft were intercepted by NATO jets in a span of two days in late September. German and Swedish fighters were scrambled in August to intercept another Il-20 plane. Over the past two years, allied plans were reportedly lifted on average every three to four weeks to intercept Russian aircraft, Deutsche Welle wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-jets-baltic-sea/	2024-10-17T00:27:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Il-Russia.jpeg
Russian attacks injure 9 in Donetsk, Kherson oblasts over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured nine people over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 17. Ukrainian air defenses downed 22 of the 65 attack drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Two drones flew in the direction of Belarus, and 27 were lost to electronic warfare means. Five drone strikes against infrastructure facilities were recorded in the front-line areas. Russia also reportedly attacked Ukraine with a Kh-95 guided aerial missile. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv and the region in several weaves and from different directions. All the drones were shot down, with falling fragments damaging an apartment building in the capital and causing a fire at a farm in Kyiv Oblast, authorities said. No casualties were reported. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three people in the towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk and in the village of Mykolaivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes injured six people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Ten houses, five multi-story buildings, a car repair shop, and cars were damaged. An attack against Mykolaiv Oblast damaged an energy infrastructure facility, resulting in a blackout. No casualties were reported, Governor Vitalii Kim said. In Sumy Oblast, Russia attacked the Znob-Novhorodske community near the Russian border with drones, setting ablaze a two-story apartment building and a car. After first responders and medical workers arrived at the scene, Russia launched further drone strikes, damaging an ambulance and a fire truck. No casualties were reported. &#xA0; Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Odesa, Ternopil, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-99/	2024-10-16T23:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Loss of coal mine near Pokrovsk would reportedly halve Ukraine's steel production	Ukraine&apos;s steel production could drop by half if Russian troops capture a vital coal mine near the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Reuters reported on Oct. 16, citing Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association. Pokrovske coal mine, the largest coking coal producer in Ukraine and one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is located 10 km (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. The mine produces coal for coke production needed in steelmaking, which is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest source of currency after agriculture, Reuters reported. The eastern front near the town has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Pokrovsk is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. According to trade data, exports of steel products totaled nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. Kalenkov said that Ukrainian steelmakers could have produced up to 7.5 million metric tons of steel by the end of the year and planned to increase production to more than 10 million tons in 2025. &quot;But if we lose Pokrovsk, then... we will fall to 2-3 million tons,&quot; he added. In 2023, Ukraine produced about 3.5 million tons of coke, using coking coal from Pokrovsk alone, according to Anatolii Starovoit, the head of the Ukrkoks coke association. &quot;We don&apos;t know where to get coal if Pokrovsk is seized,&quot; he said. An unnamed steel industry source told Reuters that producers hope to find alternative sources of coking coal from elsewhere in Ukraine if Russia occupies the Pokrovsk mines. However, imports would inevitably be needed and increase production costs, making steel less competitive. Russian forces were less than 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk as of Oct. 4, said Serhii Dobriak, the head of Pokrovsk&apos;s military administration. As the evacuation was ongoing, around 13,000 people remained in the town.	https://kyivindependent.com/coal-mine-pokrovsk/	2024-10-16T23:23:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/---------------_----------.jpeg

Ramstein meeting rescheduled to November in virtual format, White House says	The White House has rescheduled a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to November in a virtual setting after U.S. President Joe Biden cancelled his foreign trips earlier this month to handle the consequences of repeated hurricanes at home. The announcement was made following a call between Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 16 to discuss $425 million in new security assistance for Ukraine. Biden was initially supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12, but postponed amid the approach of Hurricane Milton. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming virtual Ramstein meeting will be the first one held on a leader-level. During the last one Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. At the initially planned Ramstein meeting, Zelensky was set to present his five-point victory plan to allies, although he met with leaders individually following the summit&apos;s postponement. The victory plan, which was publicly unveiled on Oct. 16, is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. Before the initial summit was postponed, the Washington Post (WP) reported, citing an undisclosed diplomat, that Ukraine may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the upcoming Ramstein summit. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 that NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance &quot;in the short term.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ramstein-meeting-rescheduled-to-november-in-virtual-format-white-house-says/	2024-10-16T20:30:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
NATO does not have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance 'in the short term,' US Ambassador says	NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance in the immediate future, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16. &quot;I think NATO&apos;s position on this is very clear. We stated at the 75th anniversary summit this summer that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership and that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; Smith said ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added. Smith&apos;s comments come as President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan, which include Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop of the list. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament in the presence of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Western diplomats. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; - though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. The Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 1, citing an unnamed Western official, that U.S. President Joe Biden may agree to advance the status of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership bid before leaving office in January. It is unclear as to whether Smith&apos;s comments suggest a possible policy shift by the Biden administration. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-does-not-plan-to-invite-ukraine-into-the-alliance-in-the-short-term-us-ambassador-says/	2024-10-16T19:31:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1572212824.jpg
UK investigating whether Russia planted incendiary device that caused parcel fire at warehouse, Guardian reports	U.K. counter-terrorism officials are investigating whether Russian intelligence officers planted an incendiary device inside a parcel that caught fire at a warehouse near Birmingham, the Guardian reported on Oct. 16. The fire, which erupted at a DHL warehouse on July 22, is believed to have been transported to the location on an airliner. The fire did not cause any injuries or significant damage, investigators said. It is unclear as to whether the plane was a cargo or passenger airliner, and where the plane was destined for. Investigators are also examining whether a similar parcel fire caused by an incendiary device - which erupted as it was being loaded onto a flight at a DHL facility in Leipzig, Germany - are connected. Intelligence agencies across Europe have warned that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent in response to countries&apos; support for Ukraine. On Monday, Germany&apos;s intelligence chief told the members of the Bundestag that had the packaged engulfed on the flight it was bound for, the fire &quot;would have resulted in a crash.&quot; When reached by the Guardian, DHL said it was working &quot;to secure its network, staff and assets as well as customer shipments&quot; following the fires at its facilities. Earlier in May, the United Kingdom&apos;s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency Mi5 was ordered to prioritize targeting spies over terrorists due to a significant recruitment drive by Russia, China, and Iran. Last week, MI5&apos;s Director General Ken McCallum said that Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) &quot;is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we&#x2019;ve seen arson, sabotage and more.&quot; In April, it was reported that Dylan Earl, a 20-year-old U.K. citizen with alleged ties to the Wagner mercenary group, had been charged with organizing an arson plot after being recruited as a Russian spy. The same month, German authorities also arrested two German-Russian nationals suspected of planning a military sabotage plot on behalf of Russian intelligence. Several other suspects have been arrested over the past year in Poland, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, and other countries for allegedly spying for Russia or other forms of collaboration with Russian intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-investigating-whether-russia-planted-explosive-device-that-caused-parcel-fire-at-warehouse-guardian-reports/	2024-10-16T18:32:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-04-083245.jpg
NATO Secretary General Rutte announces Ukraine-NATO Council meeting	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced that the next meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council is scheduled for Oct. 17. The meeting will bring together defense ministers from NATO member states alongside Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, Rustem Umerov. Key topics on the agenda are expected to include the current situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and the most pressing needs of the Ukrainian military. Rutte also noted that progress is being made in establishing a new NATO command in Wiesbaden, aimed at coordinating aid and training for Ukrainian troops, as well as fulfilling the commitment to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros in military assistance. &quot;NATO Allies provided 20.9 billion euros in military assistance to Ukraine during the first half of 2024 and Allies are on track to meet their commitments for the rest of the year,&quot; adding that &quot;the message is clear: NATO is delivering for Ukraine, and we will continue to do so.&quot; Earlier, Rutte reaffirmed NATO&apos;s support for Ukraine: &quot;The message (to Russian President Vladimir Putin) is that we will continue, that we will do what&#x2019;s necessary to make sure that he will not get his way, that Ukraine will prevail,&quot; NATO Secretary General said during a joint interview with Reuters and German radio Hessischer Rundfunk on Oct. 13. However, despite Rutte&apos;s reassurances, concerns are mounting over the future of Western support as the U.S. election approaches. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, raising fears that he may reduce or withdraw support.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-secretary-general-rutte-announces-ukraine-nato-council-meeting/	2024-10-16T14:12:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2101931335.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces $425 million in security aid for Ukraine, Zelensky says package includes long-range weapons	Key developments on Oct. 16: U.S. President Joe Biden announced $425 million in new security assistance for Ukraine during a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 16. Biden and Zelensky spoke on the phone after the U.S. president canceled foreign trips to handle the consequences of repeated hurricanes at home. The new package will consist of &quot;additional air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles, and critical munitions to meet Ukraine&apos;s urgent needs,&quot; the White House said in a statement. In the upcoming months, the U.S. will also provide Ukraine with &quot;a range of additional capabilities, including hundreds of air defense interceptors, dozens of tactical air defense systems, additional artillery systems, significant quantities of ammunition, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, and thousands of additional armored vehicles,&quot; the White House said. In a post on X, Zelensky thanked the U.S. for the new package and said that it also includes &quot;long-range weapons.&quot; He did not specify which kind of weapons and did not mention the ongoing debate over allowing Western weapons to be used for long-range strikes into Russia. Biden and Zelensky also discussed the victory plan, which was presented to individual leaders, including Biden, behind closed doors in September but made public earlier on Oct. 16. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s much-debated victory plan at parliament on Oct. 16, though some parts remained classified. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The plan involves three secret addenda that have been shared with international partners. David Arakhamia, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary leader, said the classified parts would be presented to faction leaders. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament in the presence of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Western diplomats. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s victory plan is a plan to strengthen our state and our position. To be strong enough to end the war. To make sure that Ukraine has all its muscles,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This plan can be implemented. It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners. It definitely does not depend on Russia.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO was placed at the top of the list. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022 but has yet to receive a clear signal from allies. &quot;We understand that NATO membership is a matter for the future, not the present,&quot; Zelensky said, but added that an invitation offered right away would show Russian President Vladimir Putin the error of &quot;his geopolitical calculations.&quot; &quot;We are a democratic nation that has proven that it can protect our common way of life.&quot; The second article stresses the need to bring the war to Russian territory, such as during the cross-border Kursk incursion launched in early August. This will prevent the creation of possible &quot;buffer zones&quot; on Ukrainian territory. This item also calls for lifting restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia, additional supplies of long-range capabilities, and Western support in downing Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine. Additional support in building up Ukrainian ground forces, air defenses, defense investment, intelligence assistance, and other military aid will help strengthen Ukraine and dissuade the Russian population from their &quot;ideology of war,&quot; the president said. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, one part of which will remain classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression. This point has been detailed to the leaders of the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy. The fourth part addresses Ukraine&apos;s use of its natural resources, such as uranium, titanium, and lithium, which present economic growth potential for Kyiv and the EU. Ukraine is offering a special agreement on joint investment and use of these resources with the EU and the U.S. The part further calls for ramping up international sanctions against Russia to undermine its ability to sustain its aggression. This fourth section also contains a classified section that was shared with Western partners. The fifth part concerns Ukraine&apos;s post-war security architecture. Zelensky said Kyiv boasts a large and experienced military force that can strengthen NATO and the security of the European continent. &quot;If the partners agree, then after the war, we envisage replacing certain U.S. military contingents stationed in Europe with Ukrainian units,&quot; the president said. &quot;If Putin achieves his insane geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic goals, it will create an overwhelming impression for other potential aggressors, particularly in the Gulf region, the Indo-Pacific region, and Africa, that wars of aggression can be profitable for them as well,&quot; the president told lawmakers. Zelensky noted that Putin&apos;s &quot;coalition of criminals&quot; now includes North Korea, which has provided not only weapons but also personnel for Russian factories and the military. &quot;This is effectively participation of a second state in the war against Ukraine on Russia&apos;s side.&quot; The president also highlighted the support provided by Iran and China. &quot;We must implement the victory plan to force Russia to be at the peace summit and ready to end the war.&quot; Australia will donate Ukraine 49 &quot;soon-to-be-retired&quot; U.S.-made Abrams tanks, the Australian media outlet ABC News reported on Oct. 16, citing Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy. The delivery comes after a controversy erupted earlier in 2024 when media reports emerged that the Australian military decided to quietly disassemble and bury its fleet of multi-role Taipan helicopters, even though Kyiv sent an official request for their transfer to Ukraine. Conroy told reporters that it was &quot;time to move on&quot; about the Taipan helicopters and made no indication that the decision to give Ukraine the Abrams tanks was related to the backlash over their non-delivery. The tanks will be delivered as part of a larger package of military aid worth 245 million Australian dollars ($163 million). &quot;These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine&apos;s armored brigades &#x2014; Australia has been steadfast in our support for Ukraine,&quot; Conroy said. Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said that the delivery of tanks was a &quot;significant contribution&quot; that would be an &quot;essential part of our land defenses.&quot; Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Australia has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in aid, including $866 million in military assistance. Units of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) liberated 400 hectares (988 acres) of forest in Kharkiv Oblast, killing a number of Russian soldiers, the agency reported on Oct. 16. The operation was conducted north of the village of Lyptsi, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Russian border. The village was under Russian occupation from February to September 2022, and was again targeted during Russia&apos;s renewed offensive against Kharkiv Oblast in 2024. The time frame and duration of the operation were not disclosed. According to HUR, Ukrainian soldiers captured a Russian battalion defense area, destroyed three motorized rifle battalions, a Storm platoon, and a reconnaissance company of Russia&apos;s Seventh Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment. The units also reportedly took over Russian captives. &quot;After clearing 400 hectares of forest north of Lyptsi, the situation of the invaders on this section of the front is deteriorating and close to hopeless,&quot; the agency claimed. &quot;The successful HUR mission sets conditions for further ousting the Russian occupiers from the northern part of Kharkiv Oblast.&quot; In August, Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Assault Brigade launched a successful counterattack in Kharkiv Oblast, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area. The elite 3rd Brigade has been holding the line near the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast, repelling repeated Russian assaults. Earlier in October, the brigade said it had managed to regain positions and free a group of captive Ukrainian soldiers during an engagement with a Russian sabotage group in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-35/	2024-10-16T12:15:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
Russia ramps up attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Will there be a large-scale offensive?	Fears of a larger Russian offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast are growing as Russian forces have reportedly made progress along the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and intensified air strikes on the regional capital. &quot;If they achieve a breakthrough, Russia will be able to fire at logistical routes connecting Zaporizhzhia to the east of Ukraine,&quot; Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said earlier this month in response to reports of Russian forces amassing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka, around 50 kilometers southeast of Zaporizhzhia. &quot;Russia will try to succeed at any cost to cut off our logistics,&quot; he said. The developments come at a crucial time in the war, with both Russia and Ukraine aiming to strengthen their positions ahead of possible peace talks. In recent months, Russian forces have made advances in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, including the capture of the key town of Vuhledar in early October. Having a significant advantage in troops and weapons, Russia is showing no signs of abandoning its goal of seizing more Ukrainian territory. Zaporizhzhia Oblast, in southeastern Ukraine, is one of the four oblasts Russia claims to have annexed in September 2022, although Ukrainian forces still control about a third of the oblast, including the regional capital. A map showing ssessed control of terrain in Zaporizhzhia Oblast as of Oct. 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Experts believe that it&apos;s too soon to say whether these recent moves signal the start of a major offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but such an operation seems unlikely in the near future, as Russia remains focused on the eastern front. &#x201C;I doubt Russia has the forces available to sustain such an offensive while continuing its offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast, which seems to be the priority,&#x201D; John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Kyiv Independent. In line with warnings last month from the Ukrainian military, Russia has intensified its assaults along the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, reportedly making some limited tactical gains in recent days. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is located about 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. When asked about this by the Kyiv Independent, Voloshyn said the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically,&quot; noting that neither side could regain the initiative. The crowd-sourced monitoring group DeepState shows Levadne in the grey zone as of Oct. 16, 2024. Russian and Ukrainian sources also reported Russian advances toward the nearby village of Novodarivka and in areas southwest of Velyka Novosilka. In the past two days, Russian forces carried out ground assaults near Robotyne, Mala Tokmachka, and Novodanylivka in the central part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but no confirmed gains were made, according to an Oct. 14 report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The area was the focus of Ukraine&#x2019;s 2023 southern counteroffensive, which saw the liberation of Robotyne and several other small settlements but didn&#x2019;t result in a major breakthrough.

Ukraine&#x2019;s military had been reporting since late September that Russian troops and equipment were being amassed for assault operations in the region. However, Voloshyn said that Russia was only carrying out local ground assaults and would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive in the region. Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the mayor of the Russian-occupied Mariupol, shared a video on Oct. 14 allegedly showing Russian forces transferring large numbers of troops from Russian-occupied Novoazovsk through Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast toward the occupied Polohy district, which is located closer to the front line in eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. At the same time, Russia has increased air strikes on Zaporizhzhia, causing numerous civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Russian troops began using highly destructive guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Sept. 23. Before that, the city was targeted only with missiles and drones. According to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov, Russia-launched guided aerial bombs reach the city within minutes. These bombs are almost impossible to shoot down, and Russia is producing them in large quantities. Despite the constant risk of a broader Russian offensive on all sectors of the front line, current Russian actions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast remain relatively limited, with the primary focus still on Ukrainian-held areas of Donetsk Oblast, according to experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In Zaporizhzhia, the Russians have likely made some local gains, but nothing that would alter the general situation significantly in the area,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &#x201C;Levadne is barely a village &#x2014; there are only a few buildings, and the biggest of them, which could act as a shelter for vehicles, has been blown to pieces. Capturing Levadne would mean an advance of around three kilometers over a couple of fields.&#x201D; Hardie said it&#x2019;s unclear yet whether the recent Russian advances near Levadne and Novodarivka signal a sustained axis of attack in that area. &#x201C;Russia previously conducted some attacks in the Velyka Novosilka direction, capturing Urozhaine and Staromaiorske over the summer, though nothing more came of it,&#x201D; he said. According to Hardie, Russia is also currently attacking toward Velyka Novosilka from the Zolota Nyva area near Vuhledar, which is &#x201C;consistent with Russia&apos;s broader effort to push Ukrainian forces out of southern Donetsk Oblast.&#x201D; Sambist with the Ukrainian Volunteer Army releases a surveillance drone his team will fly over Russian occupied territory from a position in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine on Sep. 14, 2023 (Lynsey Addario/Getty Images)Kastehelmi highlighted that these recent Russian ground attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast were carried out with &quot;relatively limited forces,&quot; suggesting Russian forces have not switched the main areas of their focus. &#x201C;It&apos;s possible they&apos;re just the decisions of local commanders,&#x201D; he added. Given the amount of resources Moscow has deployed to counter Ukraine&#x2019;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, which began on Aug. 6, Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst focusing on Russia and Belarus and the head of Rochan Consulting, suggests it is unlikely the Russian military has the capacity for large-scale offensive operations in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He added that Russia may be trying to give the impression of preparing for something larger to force Ukraine to spread its forces and commit reserves. The ISW echoed this sentiment in its Oct. 13 report, saying that it has not observed Russia amassing the manpower and resources needed for a major offensive like those seen in eastern Ukraine. &#x201C;Russian forces, on the contrary, have redeployed forces that were previously in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and elsewhere in southern Ukraine to respond to Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion in Kursk,&#x201D; it said. According to the ISW, this reactivation in less active areas of the front in southern Ukraine might be an attempt &#x201C;to divert Ukrainian attention away from Russia&#x2019;s priority offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast, and to fix Ukrainian forces along the front in southern Ukraine,&#x201D; The situation could change if Ukraine were to unexpectedly withdraw from Kursk Oblast, freeing up Russian forces, suggested Hardie. &#x201C;But that&apos;s obviously quite unlikely,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;And even if that were to happen, I suspect Russia would choose to reinforce its offensives in Donetsk Oblast or the Kupiansk direction (in Kharkiv Oblast).&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-advances-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-limited-as-focus-remains-on-eastern-front-experts-say/	2024-10-16T11:07:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg

SBU arrests Ukrenergo security head for allegedly justifying Russia's war, supporting murder of civilians	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) arrested one of the heads of security of the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo for allegedly justifying Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, questioning the existence of an independent Ukrainian state, and supporting the murder of civilians, the SBU said on Oct. 16. The media outlet RBC-Ukraine reported, citing unnamed sources, that the individual in question was Oleh Hrybenko, who is reportedly responsible for maintaining the security of critical infrastructure facilities. The SBU did not name the suspect. Beyond the suspect&apos;s anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian rhetoric, the SBU said that he had also leaked information about the consequences of strikes on critical infrastructure facilities. In a post on Telegram, Ukrenergo said it had suspended one of its employees in relation to the case. &quot;Any manifestations of justification for Russian aggression are unacceptable for the Ukrenergo team,&quot; it said. Ukrenergo added that nine of its employees have been killed by Russian attacks during their official duties, and another 11 have been killed fighting in the army. If convicted, the suspect faces up to eight years in prison.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-arrests-ukrenergo-official-for-allegedly-justifying-russias-war-supporting-murder-of-civilians/	2024-10-16T09:43:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-16-20_39_55.jpeg

Missile fragments found in Moldova by Ukrainian border	Missile fragments were found near the Moldovan village of Lencauti, located just 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Ukrainian border, the country&apos;s border police reported on Oct. 16. The border police said the scene was being investigated but did not comment on where the fragments had come from. It was not the first time that missile and drone debris have been found on Moldovan territory. After fragments of a Shahed-type drone were discovered on Moldovan territory in February 2024, President Maia Sandu said, &quot;Russia&apos;s war on Ukraine hits close to home in Moldova &#x2014; again. The discovery of Shahed drone debris in southern Moldova today serves as another stark reminder of the grim reality we face.&quot; &quot;Russia&apos;s aggression endangers the entire continent. Support for Ukraine must continue.&quot; Previously, Russian drone strikes against Odesa Oblast led to drone debris being found also on Romanian soil in the autumn of 2023. In response, Bucharest instituted additional security measures in the border region, which included building shelters and air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/missile-fragments-found-in-moldova-by-ukrainian-border/	2024-10-16T07:15:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1771534046.jpg
Scholz says he is open to talk to Putin about peace in Ukraine	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers in Berlin on Oct. 16 that he is willing to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a &quot;just peace&quot; in Ukraine. Scholz emphasized that he would speak to Putin &quot;if asked&quot; but stressed that no decisions would be made without the input of Ukraine or other Western allies. In recent weeks, German media have reported on an increased openness from Scholz to speak to Putin about an end to the full-scale war in Ukraine. The two leaders have not spoken since December 2022, the same year the leaders of the U.S., France, and the U.K. last had direct contact. Earlier in October, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed that Moscow had not received a proposal for Scholz and Putin to talk. The statement came two days after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Putin is not willing to speak with Scholz about brokering peace in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to accept peace and every day sends another signal in favor of war and destruction. These days, he is no longer even prepared to speak to (Scholz) on the phone,&quot; the German foreign minister said. It is unclear if any developments regarding a potential conversation between Scholz and Putin have happened since Baerbock and Peskov&apos;s comments.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-says-he-is-open-to-talk-to-putin-about-peace-in-ukraine/	2024-10-16T06:36:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177153600.jpg
Ukrainian MPs react to Zelensky's victory plan — 'Great agenda' but practical steps unclear	Ukrainian lawmakers voiced their first reactions to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s presentation of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan to parliament on Oct. 16, praising the overall agenda but calling out the supposed lack of practical steps. Some opposition lawmakers criticized it for being too vague and relying too much on international partners while omitting domestic issues, such as pro-democratic and anti-graft reforms that they say are key to Ukraine&#x2019;s success and important in achieving NATO membership. The victory plan includes five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, a non-nuclear deterrence against Russian aggression, an economic aspect, and a post-war security architecture. Three addenda remained classified but have been shared with Western partners. Zelensky pitched the plan to the leaders of the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy in an effort to drum up support before the uncertain U.S. presidential elections. The proposal has been kept mostly secret from the public until now. Roman Lozynskyi, a lawmaker formerly from the opposition Holos (Voice) party, wrote on Facebook that the plan has a &quot;great agenda,&quot; but the actual steps to achieve them remain unclear. &quot;On one hand, the victory plan sounds like a fantasy. On the other hand, so did the Patriots, Storm Shadow, the F-16s, sinking a chunk of the (Russian) Black Sea Fleet, and controlling part of Kursk Oblast.&quot; Lozynskyi stressed that everything now rests &quot;on the decisions of partners and the success of our diplomacy&quot; as well as on the unity among the Ukrainian leadership and the opposition. In presenting the plan to parliament, Zelensky said it is &#x201C;a plan to strengthen our state and our position. To be strong enough to end the war. To make sure that Ukraine has all its muscles.&#x201D; &quot;This plan can be implemented. It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners. It definitely does not depend on Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Lozynskyi also said that Zelensky did not explain, however, how he plans to implement the plan&#x2019;s various points, adding that it may not be wise to make these steps public. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn from the Holos party highlighted that the victory plan has been agreed upon with the Ukrainian military command and is being coordinated with Western partners. &#x201C;I have no doubt that many people have ideas and comments on what and how to improve it. However, for me&#x2026; the best criticism is action.&#x201D; Oleksii Honcharenko, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party led by former president Petro Poroshenko, criticized the plan for supposedly relying too much on outside assistance without requiring steps from the Ukrainian leadership. &quot;Where is the clause on the fight against corruption, on strengthening our democratic institutions?&quot; Hocharenko wrote on Telegram. The lawmaker described the plan as &quot;empty words&quot; that are &quot;removed from reality.&quot; Honcharenko&apos;s party colleague, Iryna Herashchenko, praised the plan&apos;s general goals but also criticized its focus on international support, noting that the word &quot;partners&quot; has been used more often than &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Russia.&quot; She also pointed out the absence of &quot;homework&quot; Ukraine needs to do to achieve these goals, such as anti-corruption reforms that are a necessary step for NATO membership. &quot;I wonder why the president has come to parliament now? For me, this is a signal of the seriousness of the situation at the front, in the economy, of the shift on the global stage,&quot; the lawmaker said. &quot;The return of the borders of 1991... is no longer heard... (but) the fact that certain territories may have to be liberated through political, diplomatic measures was also not heard.&quot; A third European Solidarity lawmaker, Mykola Kniazhytskyi, presented a less scathing commentary. &#x201C;The most important thing (Zelensky) said was&#x2026; that Ukrainian troops could replace, in particular, American troops in Europe, partners&apos; troops, because they have experience,&quot; the lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent. According to Kniazhytskyi, the presentation of Zelensky&apos;s victory plan may play a role in the upcoming U.S. election. &#x201C;The themes voiced by President Zelensky will obviously be used by Democrats in the presidential campaign. It will be difficult for the Republicans to object to them... That is, it can be used by both parties in the U.S,&#x201D; Kniazhytskyi said. &#x201C;If this plan is agreed with Western allies, I&apos;m (fully in support of the plan). If they are not ready for it, and he is only talking about it for the sake of PR, then it will be a big disappointment.&#x201D; Unlike some opposition lawmakers, the parliamentary leader of Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party praised the plan as a &quot;very detailed document&quot; offering Kyiv&apos;s partners a &quot;strategy of mutual reinforcement.&quot; &quot;Without our victory, without an honest and fair peace for Ukraine, the world will not be able to feel safe,&quot; David Arakhamia said on Telegram. &quot;But a strong, independent, and European Ukraine will be able to contribute to the collective security of the entire continent,&quot; Arakhamia commented, highlighting Kyiv&apos;s role in the plan. The top lawmaker from Zelensky&apos;s party also revealed that after the presentation, the president held a meeting with parliamentary leaders. Arakhamia told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that the classified parts of the plan would be shared only with the parliamentary leadership. As Ukrainian lawmakers react to the victory plan, Western partners have remained mostly tight-lipped. The U.S. State Department said diplomatically that the proposal includes &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; though some partners were reportedly &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the plan. Several Western officials believe it leans too heavily on additional arms supplies and on lifting restrictions on their use and does not bring many new ideas to the table, the Wall Street Journal reported in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-mps-react-to-zelenskys-victory-plan-great-agenda-but-practical-steps-unclear/	2024-10-16T05:56:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-Oct-16.jpeg
Opinion: Pakistan can’t walk the tightrope between Russia and the West forever	Imran Khan, cricket star and then-prime minister of Pakistan, visited Russia on Feb. 23-24, 2022 &#x2013; the first visit by a Pakistani leader to Russia in over two decades. On the second day of his visit, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some political analysts suspected that Khan&#x2019;s visit was simply another impulsive move, made without consulting experienced policymakers. However, two and a half years and two prime ministers later, Pakistan&#x2019;s relationship with Russia continues to warm. In September, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk visited Pakistan, where he met with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and held a joint press conference with Pakistani Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, announcing intentions to improve economic cooperation and bilateral trade. In a context where Russia is increasingly alienating itself from the global community due to its war in Ukraine, why is a large, developing South Asian country so keen on rapprochement? Pakistan and Russia have never been particularly close allies, but they have been inching closer in recent years. This warning relationship is marked by their signing of a bilateral defense coordination agreement in 2014 and Russia&#x2019;s support for Pakistan joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2017. Pakistan also accepted Russia&#x2019;s invitation to join Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s International North-South Transport Corridor, which Putin envisions stretching from Europe to the Middle East and India &#x2013; a new Silk Road or a competing Belt and Road Initiative. Security cooperation has also ramped up, with joint military exercises in 2016 and 2018. This reflects the convergence of Russo-Pakistani interests. First, the Kremlin is looking to Islamabad for support in tackling violent extremism on its periphery, particularly related to the instability created by the wars in Afghanistan. Secondly, Putin and some Pakistani leaders share similar views on freedom of speech; blasphemy is a capital crime in Pakistan, and Khan previously expressed gratitude to Putin for speaking out in support of respect for the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Finally, economic interests tie the two countries together. Pakistan is experiencing an energy crisis, while Russia is seeking more buyers for its oil. In contrast, Pakistan&#x2019;s relations with Ukraine have been more limited. After independence, Pakistan and Ukraine established ties quickly, but these have been restricted to minor military, economic, and trade cooperation &#x2013; particularly Pakistan&#x2019;s purchase of defense equipment. However, this relationship has been growing, with both sides investing more energy in defense production collaborations and joint ventures. Ukraine has also become a major wheat exporter to Pakistan, with nearly 1.4 million metric tons of wheat imported from Ukraine in 2020-2021. Then-Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan (R) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (not seen) meet at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Feb. 24, 2024. (Kremlin Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)With the outbreak of war, Pakistan&#x2019;s geopolitical trajectory in Eastern Europe has not changed significantly because the underlying drivers shaping its relationships with Russia and Ukraine remain the same. Underpinning its energy needs, food security concerns, and political ties is the necessity of building relationships that offer Pakistan stability and security amid considerable regional competition. Pakistan was created in 1947 when the British Raj was divided into India and Pakistan (and modern-day Bangladesh). Pakistan has gone to war with India several times, and the insecurity it feels from India on its eastern border remains one of its greatest existential threats and a significant driver of its politics and security calculations. Today, Indo-Pakistani relations are stable, as both countries have more pressing issues to address, but competition remains intense. Notably, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently focused on strengthening regional ties. India also maintains a much stronger strategic and economic relationship with Russia, which is deeper than Pakistan&#x2019;s, and it has robust and growing ties with the United States. To Pakistan&#x2019;s west lies Afghanistan. For many years, Pakistan was a key regional partner for the U.S., which used it as a base for operations in Afghanistan. This partnership ensured significant U.S. investment in Pakistan, including military training, equipment, and substantial aid. Today, the countries have stable ties, but the U.S. has less incentive to support the Pakistani state beyond the bare minimum. Nevertheless, the U.S. remains a key trade partner and source of aid, particularly through the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so Pakistan cannot afford to alienate them. This may explain Pakistan&#x2019;s multiple statements supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and sovereignty, the first of which came the day before Khan&#x2019;s visit to Moscow. Finally, to Pakistan&#x2019;s northeast is China. China has a strong presence in Pakistan through trade, investment, and development aid delivered in coordination with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, China faces security challenges in Pakistan, particularly regarding terrorism in Balochistan, and it is also concerned about the country&#x2019;s economic instability. Pakistan&#x2019;s political and military leadership now face the challenge of balancing the need to maintain these relationships and fulfill competing interests without alienating any allies. The U.S. is particularly wary of Pakistan&#x2019;s growing ties with China and Russia, but Pakistan feels compelled to pursue alternative relationships as American aid has fallen far short of previous levels. Pakistan&#x2019;s burgeoning relationship with Russia represents a newer attempt to replicate what it has been doing with China for years. The country is trying to secure diplomatic, military, and economic support from Russia without jeopardizing its currently more important relations with the West. Going forward, Pakistan&#x2019;s current leadership is giving every indication that it will continue this balancing act: maintaining ties with both Ukraine and Russia, prioritizing its own economic and security situation above all else. Constrained by its economic and geopolitical status, Pakistan has few close, powerful friends and does not believe it can afford to upset any of its partners. At the same time, it believes that for its own security, it must continue building new ties, even when those countries are engaged in conflict. Despite these political, economic, and security realities, there remains hope that Pakistan will take a more principled approach. As a country founded as a homeland for South Asia&#x2019;s Muslims, ideology has always played a key role. In April 2022, then-Chief of Army Staff General Bajwa said Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance was giving hope to smaller countries that they could defend their territory against larger, aggressive neighbors &#x2013; suggesting some leaders see parallels between Pakistan and Ukraine, and between India and Russia. If Pakistan&#x2019;s leadership truly supports Ukraine, it should adopt a foreign policy that reflects this. While a non-aligned approach has its logic, Pakistan&#x2019;s inconsistent implementation often leads potential partners to mistrust its actions and motives. It can be difficult to predict Pakistan&#x2019;s next move, making stronger partnerships harder to build. By adopting a more principled foreign policy, including on issues like Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Pakistan can pursue honest and ethical policies that will also foster strong, stable alliances to support its political, economic, and security goals.

Ukraine approves 'electronic warfare resistant' domestic-made Chaklun drone for military use	The domestically produced Chaklun (Wizard) drone has been approved for use by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry said on Oct. 16. The drone can help adjust artillery fire and is resistant to Russian electronic warfare means thanks to &quot;high-tech materials,&quot; the ministry said. The Chaklun can operate in bad weather, and Ukrainian programmers have created control software for the drone. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines. According to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology.	https://kyivindependent.com/chaklun/	2024-10-16T05:35:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-16-151926.png
Kazakhstan won't seek BRICS membership 'in the foreseeable future'	Kazakhstan&apos;s president has &quot;carefully considered&quot; proposals to join BRICS but Astana will not seek to join the group &quot;in the foreseeable future,&quot; a government spokesperson told Tengrinews.kz in an interview published on Oct. 16. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. &quot;The president (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) has received proposals on Kazakhstan&apos;s accession to BRICS. After all, our country is recognized as a responsible and authoritative member of the international community,&quot; presidential spokesperson and advisor Berik Uali said. &quot;However, at present and most likely in the foreseeable future, Kazakhstan will refrain from submitting an application to BRICS,&quot; the spokesperson said, citing the &quot;multi-stage application process&quot; and unspecified &quot;development prospects&quot; of the group as the reason. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined the international organization at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Tokayev nevertheless plans to visit an upcoming BRICS forum on Oct. 23-24 in Russia&apos;s Kazan at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kazakhstan has been walking a tightrope between Russia and the West since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. While refusing to support Russian aggression and stressing its role as an independent actor, the Central Asian country has become one of the key pathways for sanctioned goods flowing to Russia. Speaking alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last month in Astana, Tokayev voiced the belief that &quot;Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense.&quot; &quot;A further escalation of war will lead to irreparable consequences for the whole of humanity and above all for the countries involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,&quot; Tokayev added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kazakhstan-brics/	2024-10-16T05:02:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1771973857.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine braces for winter freeze	The following is the Oct. 15, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine is set to face its toughest winter since the start of the invasion as Russia eyes cutting off its nuclear power after already taking out half its electricity generation sector in attacks. Russia hasn&#x2019;t directly struck nuclear plants with missiles and kamikaze drones but is increasingly targeting nearby infrastructure, such as substations containing crucial equipment that connect nuclear plants to the grid. What could that mean for Ukraine? Large-scale attacks against nuclear infrastructure would freeze out Ukrainians and cause a humanitarian crisis if the country can&#x2019;t swiftly repair and protect those assets. If Russian attacks successfully disconnect all the power plants from the grid, then Ukraine&#x2019;s only stable power source is gone, said Warsaw-based energy analyst Wojciech Jakobik. &#x201C;(Nuclear power) is a baseload capacity, which is irreplaceable by renewables, other sources, and especially not by energy imports,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;With a smaller nuclear capacity in place, Ukraine will have less flexibility and less ability to stabilize (energy) generation.&#x201D; Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of power generation, including eight thermal plants and five hydro plants, due to Russian strikes this year. &#x201C;We&apos;re in a world where (Ukraine) has a deficit of functioning infrastructure. This is going to be the hardest winter yet,&#x201D; International Energy Agency (IEA) Chief Economist Tim Gould told the Kyiv Independent.

(Yurii Stefanyak/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russia goes after Ukraine&#x2019;s grain exports, againRussia has stepped up its attacks against civilian ships and port infrastructure around Odesa in recent days, in an apparent attempt to cause damage to Ukraine&#x2019;s exports. &quot;The purpose of these attacks is to reduce our export potential,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. &quot;This is a deliberate attempt to provoke a food crisis in those parts of the world that are directly dependent on Ukrainian grain supplies,&#x201D; he said. What has been hit? Over the past week, Russia has carried out six attacks in the area, killing at least 15 people and injuring over 30. The missile attacks have damaged civilian vessels, including the Palau-flagged Optima, which was hit in an earlier attack on Oct. 7, and the Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged Paresa which was carrying 6,000 metric tons of corn for export. It&#x2019;s hard to tell yet if these attacks will have a significant impact on arrivals to Ukraine&#x2019;s ports, Bridget Diakun, maritime risk analyst at Lloyd&#x2019;s List Intelligence, told our business reporter Dominic Culverwell. After all, ships traveling to and from the country&#x2019;s ports in the Black Sea know there are risks. &#x201C;From my conversations with the shipping industry, there&apos;s not yet a huge amount of concern although they acknowledge the situation is becoming riskier,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Depending on how the next days/weeks play out could change things.&#x201D; A border guard is seen at the newly renovated &quot;Krakovets - Korchova&quot; checkpoint on the Ukrainian-Polish border near the village of Krakovets in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 16, 2022. (Pavlo Palamarchuk/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Customs reformAt a time when state coffers are starving for money to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, smuggling is costing the country billions of dollars a year in lost customs fees. How much we talking? Through bribery or lying, smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year as they smuggle everything from cigarettes and iPhones to perfume and food across the border undeclared or mislabeled. &#x201C;Customs is perhaps the single biggest cash cow that brings corrupt money into Ukraine&apos;s political system. It&#x2019;s the largest tax-evasion scheme in the country,&#x201D; said Josh Rudolph, head of the transatlantic democracy working group of the U.S.-based think tank German Marshall Fund. With mounting internal and external pressure on Ukraine to reign in corruption at the border, parliament has passed an extensive new reform bill to overhaul the State Customs Service. The bill was submitted to the president on Sept. 23 and will take effect after he signs it into law, though its effects of reforms may take years to show up in the state&#x2019;s budget.

(Personal archive of Lunca Bar Team)Kherson bar finds new life in KyivIn late summer of 2022, Lunca Bar owner Yehor Lohvynovskyi and his team were taking a walk in Kyiv when they spotted an empty courtyard &#x2014; &#x201C;We should open a bar in a place like this!&#x201D; one of his coworkers said half-jokingly. None of them knew at the time that the joke would turn into real business plans less than a year later in February 2023. The bar&#x2019;s original location, the southern city of Kherson, while liberated from Kremlin forces in November 2022, was under constant Russian shelling. Russia&#x2019;s destruction of the Kahkovka dam later in 2023 flooded the bar. Rebuilding in Kyiv was the only path forward for the business if it wanted to stay open. Today, Lunca Bar stands in the heart of Kyiv, its vibrant courtyard off of Yaroslaviv Val Street filling up during the warm season. Inside, the team recreated the cozy atmosphere of the Kherson location, with some of the bar&#x2019;s original tables and the walls still adorned with artwork from the city&#x2019;s artists.

(Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Q&amp;A with foreign defense investorsUkraine has become a hotbed of defense innovation, as Russia&#x2019;s deadly invasion fuels a rapid development of new battlefield technologies. But with its economy drained by the war, the country desperately needs foreign investment if it wants to take its innovation to the next level and become a global leader in the defense sector. The government has launched several initiatives to encourage foreign investment, including Brave1, an accelerator program. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s reporter Andrea Januta sat down with two foreign investors who have been working as strategic partners with Brave1 to discuss the defense tech sector in Ukraine and how to attract further investment. Despite lower levels of foreign investment in the sector than one would hope, the two are ebullient about the country&#x2019;s prospects. &#x201C;I want to say on the record that we believe that in the next five years, the Ukrainian defense sector will attract half a billion dollars of venture capital,&#x201D; Andre Pienaar, co-founder and chief executive of investment firm C5 Capital said. The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe Ukraine&#x2019;s start-up defense sector right now, and what has changed as it matures? Michael Hewitt: Ukraine has gone from having a traditional defense industry to now shifting its attention to the innovation of asymmetric warfare, drone warfare &#x2014; air, sea, even subsea. What we&apos;re looking to do now is lift that to the next phase of venture capital: growth, scalability, and following exactly what President Zelensky said he wanted to do, which was build capacity in the defense industry. Everything from artillery shell factories to building up the capacity to defend the country and be part of the European defense industry. The Kyiv Independent: A few weeks ago, BraveOne announced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech industry had attracted $12 million in private investments since the beginning of the war. This number has grown compared with last year but is still very low compared to other countries. What do you think is stopping investors? Andre Pienaar: I think there are two things that we can do in Ukraine to scale this capital. One is to do as much mentoring among founders as possible about lessons learned, mistakes made, and how to work with outside capital and venture capital. The second thing is that the government does as much as it can to lift restrictions on the export of Ukrainian intellectual property and know-how so that Ukrainian founders can build companies that can really go global and become unicorns.

According to Anduril, their new drones will be capable of flying for 40 minutes and covering a range of 20 kilometers (12 miles). Anduril raised $1.5 billion at the beginning of August in the largest defense tech funding round ever publicized. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, passed in the second reading a bill to increase taxes for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion as it looks to raise more money for its budget needs. The bill is very unpopular among the business community that feels it unfairly targets taxpayers as the government continues to fail to go after illegal businesses that avoid taxes. The bill still needs to be signed by the president before it goes into effect. The sale of UMCC Titanium &#x2014; one of the largest titanium producers in the world &#x2014; is one of the most high-profile privatizations after the iconic Hotel Ukraina in Kyiv was sold recently in an auction, and is the first successful auction of a large industrial holding in many years. Cemin Ukraine, a Neqsol Holding company owned by Azeri businessman Nasib Hasanov, who also owns Vodafone, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest mobile operator, was the sole bidder in the auction. The sale is part of the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;Great Privatization&#x201D; initiative to shore up funds for the wartime budget. &quot;This is a game-changing amount of money,&quot; Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council&apos;s GeoEconomics Center, told Reuters, referring to the combined effect of the new World Bank fund and an announcement the previous day that the EU had approved the 35 billion euro loan as part of the G7 loan. &quot;It&apos;s real resources on the ground that can make a difference,&quot; Lipsky said. The event follows previous conferences in London in 2023 and Berlin in 2024 and is aimed at mobilizing support for Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction and recovery efforts. &quot;Looking at future peace and prosperity also means looking at reconstruction, and I am happy to announce that the &apos;Ukraine Recovery Conference&apos; will be held in Rome on 10-11 July 2025,&quot; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Oct. 10 after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-braces-for-winter-freeze/	2024-10-16T03:04:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Ukraine reportedly reclaims territory in north of Kharkiv Oblast, almost entire Russian regiment destroyed	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Units of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) liberated 400 hectares (988 acres) of forest in Kharkiv Oblast, killing a number of Russian soldiers, the agency reported on Oct. 16. The operation was conducted north of the village of Lyptsi, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Russian border. The village was under Russian occupation from February to September 2022, and was again targeted during Russia&apos;s renewed offensive against Kharkiv Oblast in 2024.

As Saudi oil hike tests Russia’s war-railed economy, Israeli strikes on Iran could offer boost	Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s oil production hike plan may not break Russia&#x2019;s petro-export-fueled economy, but escalations between Iran and Israel would be a gold rush for Moscow. Since late 2022, the OPEC oil cartel, of which Russia is a member, has withheld oil production and exports to prevent a surplus in the market. But Russia and other members didn&#x2019;t follow the restrictions which got under the skin of OPEC&#x2019;s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia. In response, Riyadh said it would hike oil production in December which could cause global prices to deflate and penalize non-cooperative OPEC members. While Russia will also be allowed to boost oil production, its capacity to do so is far more limited than Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s. Oil and natural gas exports are the backbone of Russia&#x2019;s economy, accounting for around 35-40% of its budget revenues pre-full-scale invasion. The country&#x2019;s energy sector, led by CEOs close to President Vladimir Putin, has kept Russia reliant on fossil fuels to line its pockets with quick profits instead of seeking economic diversification and growth. Russia is already discounting its Ural crude by $12-15 against Brent oil, the global benchmark, to offset the risks associated with Russian trade. On top of Group of Seven (G7) sanctions that have blocked Russia&#x2019;s access to the Western oil market, Moscow and its war efforts could suffer if superior Saudi crude floods the market.

(Maya Siddiqui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;For Russia, this is doubly dangerous because it will firstly force them to drop the prices of their oil to compete in the market, and also find buyers who are willing to take their oil despite existing sanctions,&#x201D; Vaibhav Raghunandan, EU-Russia Analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Currently, Russian Ural crude prices are hovering around $67 per barrel with production costs around $17-18 per barrel. If prices slide to $30 per barrel, Russia&#x2019;s economy would take a major stumble and hamper its war effort in Ukraine, Raghunandan said. For now, this scenario looks unlikely unless there is a global recession, David Fyfe, chief economist at Argus Media, a market analyst group, told the Kyiv Independent. OPEC producers plan to gradually introduce oil to the market at an additional 198,000 barrels per day each month, which is not enough to dramatically reduce prices and suddenly crash Russia&#x2019;s economy, he said. Even if crude prices drop to $50 per barrel, which Riyadh says is a possibility, Russia could sustain itself for six months or more, he added. Fyfe doesn&#x2019;t see enough international demand for the extra barrels. The second quarter of 2025 will be the real test for the market, and it could cause OPEC to U-turn on the decision and cut production again. Russia&#x2019;s oil sector has managed to bypass export sanctions to the West via its shadow fleet, although at incurred costs. Its oil and gas revenues this year jumped by around 50% compared to 2023. However, Russia&#x2019;s export options are limited. Moscow sends nearly half of its crude to China but the country is in the grips of an economic crisis fueled by the property market crash and Beijing&#x2019;s oil demand has likely peaked, limiting Russia&#x2019;s room for growth. &#x201C;It seems highly unlikely that Western Europe and the U.S. is going to be in the market for Russian oil or refined oil products anytime soon,&#x201D; Fyfe said. &#x201C;If Russia wants to boost export revenues, it might sell a bit more (oil) to India. In a given year, it might sell a bit more to China, but there&apos;s not a huge import growth coming from China,&#x201D; he added.

(Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Moreover, the sanctions that limit Russia&#x2019;s access to Western technology, which its oil assets rely on, could erode the industry over the next five years, he said. Moscow likely has one eye on the potential of tighter sanctions over the next few years, he added. &#xA0; The saving grace for Russia&#x2019;s oil sector would be an escalation in west Asia. Iran&#x2019;s missile attacks on Israel on Oct. 1 caused oil prices to spike by nearly $10 a barrel as concerns arose over an Israeli retaliation. Prices have been pulled back down again by a slightly anemic global economy, but if Israel targets Iran&#x2019;s energy sector then they could jump again, noted Fyfe. Currently, Israel has said it will leave Iran&#x2019;s oil and nuclear facilities alone following alarm bells from the Gulf States. But if this situation does escalate, experts hypothesize that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, which sees 15-20% of global oil supplies pass through daily. The result would be a &#x201C;bonanza for the Russian economy and its government&#x201D; as prices skyrocket, said Vasily Astrov, an economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, a think tank. Yet Iran would be shooting itself in the foot by blocking its own oil exports. Tehran is only likely to resort to the option as a &#x201C;last roll of the dice,&#x201D; Fyfe said.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-oil-hike-tests-russias-war-railed-economy-israeli-strikes-on-iran-could-offer-boost/	2024-10-16T02:40:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229695308.jpg
BREAKING: NATO, long-range strikes, deterrence — Zelensky unveils Ukraine's victory plan	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s much-debated victory plan at parliament on Oct. 16, though some parts remained classified. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The plan involves three secret addenda. David Arakhamia, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary leader, said that the secret items would be presented to faction leaders. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament. Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO was placed at the top of the list. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022 but has yet to receive a clear signal from the allies. The second article stresses the need to bring the war to Russian territory, such as during the cross-border Kursk incursion launched in early August. This item also calls for lifting restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia and Western support in downing Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence and includes a secret part. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-victory-plan/	2024-10-16T02:22:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/29feee4480122502cb728f1cc8bdac91_1659015958_extra_large.jpeg
Biden to meet UK, German, French leaders in Berlin this week, CNN reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to meet the leaders of Germany, France, and the U.K. in Berlin later this week after his earlier visit was postponed due to Hurricane Milton, CNN reported on Oct. 16, citing three unnamed Western officials. Berlin has confirmed that Biden would visit Germany at the end of the week. The trip will reportedly take place on Oct. 18. The U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France are Ukraine&apos;s leading arms suppliers and play a crucial role in supporting Kyiv&apos;s resistance against Russian aggression. It remains unclear whether the upcoming meeting of the Western leaders will lead to major strategic decisions. The U.S. president was supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein summit, in Germany on Oct. 12, where Ukraine&apos;s victory plan was to be presented. No new date for the summit was set. Instead, President Volodymyr Zelensky went on a European tour to present his plan to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, hoping to rally support among Western allies. Ukraine&apos;s president pitched the plan to Biden while visiting the U.S. in late September. Ukrainian officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky is pushing for renewed military and financial support from Europe amid concerns that backing could weaken if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins next month&apos;s election. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front and target critical energy infrastructure as the winter looms. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-to-meet-uk-german-french-leaders-in-berlin-this-week-cnn-reports/	2024-10-16T01:58:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161024572-1.jpg
France's first 'kamikaze' drones to arrive in Ukraine 'in the coming weeks'	France successfully tested its first &quot;kamikaze&quot; drones and will deliver them to Ukraine &quot;in the coming weeks,&quot; French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Oct. 16. &quot;Tests of France&apos;s first remotely operated munition &#x2013; also called kamikaze drones&quot; had been a &quot;success,&quot; Lecornu said. Drones are an increasingly vital capability in Ukrainian battlefields. Russia has widely used kamikaze drones like Iranian Shaheds to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure or domestically-made Lancets against Kyiv&apos;s troops. With the rising importance of unmanned systems on modern battlefields, Lecornu said earlier this year that the French military would order 2,000 kamikaze drones. The first 100 will be sent to Ukraine. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of the French drone&apos;s test published by French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu on X on Oct. 16, 2024.The Colibri loitering ammunition has been under development by France&apos;s Delair and KNDS since last year. The Calibri project was launched to develop a system with a radius of 5 kilometers at a cost of less than 20,000 euros ($22,000) per unit. The drones should be delivered to Ukraine in 2024-2025. Delair has previously provided Ukraine with 100 UX-11 reconnaissance drones and 50 larger DT-26 drones. &quot;Kamikaze drones are absolutely fundamental&quot; and will be able to &quot;complement Caesar howitzers,&quot; the minister said, referring to the advanced artillery systems France has supplied to Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, France has allocated roughly $3.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including Caesar howitzers and AMX-10 armored vehicles. Paris also pledged to provide its Mirage 2000 jets next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-supply-ukraine-with-kamikaze-drones/	2024-10-16T01:34:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2035946601.jpg
UK preparing suggestions to Ukraine's victory plan, Syrskyi says	The U.K. is working on its own proposals as part of the practical part of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 16 after a phone call with his British counterpart. Following a conversation with U.K. Chief of Defense Staff Tony Radakin, Syrskyi said that they discussed the possibility of hitting Russian military targets &quot;in operational and strategic depth.&quot; The news came hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s expected presentation of the victory plan during an address to parliament. More sensitive details are expected to be revealed only to parliamentary leaders, the parliamentary leader of the ruling party, David Arakhamia, told the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky was also invited to present his plan at a summit of EU leaders this week. He had already unveiled it to U.S. President Joe Biden and other key partners, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. &quot;Supply of military equipment and weapons, training of personnel, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the use of high-tech means of destruction are the main pillars of Ukrainian-British military cooperation,&quot; Syrskyi added. Top officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The key components focus on military, diplomatic, and economic areas, as well as post-war reconstruction. Specific steps include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast also plays a role in creating pressure on Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-working-on-suggestions-to-ukraines-victory-plan-syrskyi-says/	2024-10-16T00:58:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Ukraine's EU entry 'not an existential matter,' Warsaw can name conditions, Polish minister says on Volyn massacre	Poland can make Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU contingent on the resolution of the Volyn massacre as joining the bloc is not a matter of the country&apos;s survival, a Polish minister said in a media interview published on Oct. 15. Speaking to the Interia outlet, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz stressed that Warsaw continues supporting Kyiv through military and humanitarian aid regardless of historical issues. Kosiniak-Kamysz said in June that Ukraine would not enter the EU without resolving the Volyn massacre, a tragic episode in Polish-Ukrainian history in 1943 when members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. &quot;Joining the EU is not an existential matter for Ukraine; it is an opportunity for development, higher GDP growth,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz told Interia. &quot;Together with the conditions set by the EU, we can put forward our ethical and historical conditions regarding Volyn.&quot; Ukraine launched membership talks with the EU earlier this year, but the final decision will require consensus among all 27 members. The matter of the Volyn massacre was raised again by Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski last month, reportedly leading to a tense exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the remaining tensions relate to Warsaw&apos;s request for the exhumation of massacred Poles buried in modern-day Ukraine. Ukraine blocked the exhumation in 2017 after Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland were vandalized. In early October, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance promised to begin searches and exhumations next year. The matter has also sparked tensions inside the Polish leadership. President Andrzej Duda said that blocking Ukraine&apos;s EU accession is in line with &quot;Vladimir Putin&apos;s policy.&quot; Duda made the comment even though objections to Ukraine&apos;s entry over the Volyn issue were also raised by the previous conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which was allied with the president. &quot;This may come as a surprise, but this government is taking the issue of exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims and their commemoration much more seriously than the previous government,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz claimed in the interview.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-volyn-eu-poland/	2024-10-16T00:48:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153247705.jpg
US doesn't defend Ukraine with THAAD system like Israel due to 'different capabilities,' Pentagon says	The United States is not deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile battery to protect Ukraine, as it will do in Israel, given the different defense capabilities of the two nations, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Oct. 15. Following Iran&apos;s recent attack on Israel, Washington authorized the deployment of the THAAD in the country to bolster Israel&apos;s missile defense capabilities. The advanced surface-to-air interceptor is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. Iran reportedly launched more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Russia regularly attacks Ukraine with dozens of Iranian Shahed-type drones and missiles, targeting civilian infrastructure. When asked why the U.S. would not deploy the THAAD system in neighboring Romania or Poland to help defend Ukraine&apos;s west from Russian attacks, Singh cited different commitments to the countries, including a longstanding partnership with Israel. &quot;Different capabilities, different wars, different regions. The commitments also to Israel and Ukraine are different,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;it is a little bit of apples and oranges here.&quot; According to Singh, the Biden administration continues to support both Ukraine and Israel in meeting their different needs. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s neighboring NATO countries could help shoot down Russian aerial targets over Ukraine too, but the partners &quot;are not yet ready&quot; for this. &quot;What works in the skies of the Middle East and helps Israel&apos;s defense can work just as well in the skies of our part of Europe &#x2013; in Ukraine &#x2013; helping to save lives,&quot; he said on Oct. 3. Asked in early October why the West could not help Ukraine shoot down Russian missiles as it did during Iran&apos;s recent attack on Israel, Singh said that these are &quot;two very different landscapes and battlefields.&quot; According to the spokesperson, such a move would involve the United States in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/thaad/	2024-10-16T00:33:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-908835.jpg
Large-scale power outages reported in Ukraine's south	The southern city of Kherson has completely lost electricity for as of yet unknown reasons, Roman Mrochko, the city&apos;s military administration head, said on Oct. 16. &quot;According to preliminary information, the entire city was cut off. The reasons are being determined,&quot; Mrochko said on Telegram. The same morning, power outages were reported in Mykolaiv Oblast, which is neighboring Kherson Oblast. &quot;Many people have lost electricity. We identified the source. There was no strike. We will fix it in a couple of hours if there are no further surprises,&quot; Governor Vitalii Kim said. While the officials did not link the recent outages to Russian strikes, cities and villages across Ukraine have experienced regular blackouts as a result of attacks against the energy grid during the full-scale war. Russia launched over 130 Shahed-type drones against Ukraine overnight on Oct. 16, in addition to missiles and other weaponry. Both Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts suffered attacks. Kyiv recently warned that Russia is likely to resume its attacks against the power grid in the coming autumn and winter months, mimicking the strategy employed in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023 and this year&apos;s spring.	https://kyivindependent.com/kherson-mykolaiv-outages/	2024-10-15T23:47:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1244832834.jpg
51 of 136 Russian drones downed in mass overnight attack on Ukraine, Air Force says	Ukrainian air defenses downed 51 of the 136 Shahed-type attack drones launched during a Russian attack overnight on Oct. 16, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. The drones were reportedly launched from the Russian port town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk, located on the coast of the Sea of Azov, and from Russia&apos;s Kursk and Orel oblasts. Aircraft, missile and electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups of the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted the drones over 14 oblasts across Ukraine, the Air Force said. According to the Kyiv City Military Administration, air defenses intercepted all drones Russia launched against Ukraine&apos;s capital. Russia attacked an industrial facility in western Ternopil Oblast, causing a large-scale fire that was later put out, Governor Viacheslav Nehoda said. No casualties were reported. Sixty drones were &quot;lost&quot; due to electronic warfare in a number of regions, while 20 more drones were flying over Ukraine at the time of publication, according to the statement. Two more drones flew back toward Russia. Russian forces also attacked Donetsk Oblast with an S-300/400 missile and launched a Kh-59 cruise missile against Chernihiv Oblast. Drone attacks are a daily occurrence in Ukraine, affecting various regions across the country. Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 1,300 such drones in September, launching them on a daily basis for an entire month.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-136-drones-at-ukraine/	2024-10-15T23:12:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147853376-3.jpg
New level of desperation' — US 'concerned' by reports of North Korean soldiers joining Russia in Ukraine	Washington is &quot;concerned&quot; by recent reports that Pyongyang had sent its soldiers to join Russian occupying forces in Ukraine, White House National Council spokesperson Sean Savett said on Oct. 15. &quot;Such a move would also indicate a new level of desperation for Russia as it continues to suffer significant casualties on the battlefield in its brutal war against Ukraine,&quot; Savett said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused North Korea of sending personnel to support Russia and said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; Pyongyang in the war in the coming months. While the Kremlin has denied the reports, there is mounting evidence that the Russian-North-Korean cooperation has reached a new level. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it is unclear what kind of soldiers they are. The two countries have deepened military ties during the full-scale war, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signing a strategic partnership agreement in June. North Korea has previously supplied Russian forces with artillery shells and ballistic missiles, both extensively deployed against Ukrainian troops and cities. Savett commented that the transfer of soldiers would mark a significant shift in the Russian-North-Korean defense ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-north-korea-ukraine/	2024-10-15T22:55:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg

Governor orders mandatory evacuation from Kupiansk	Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov announced on Oct. 15 that local authorities would conduct mandatory evacuations of residents living in the city of Kupiansk, as well as three adjacent communities, amid ongoing Russian advances in the region. Kupiansk is a crucial strategic city in Kharkiv Oblast that was temporarily occupied by Russian troops in 2022. In recent months, Kupiansk has been under heavy attacks as Russia intensified assault attempts in the area. Russian forces have been considerably more active near Kupiansk over the past months, following Russia&apos;s attempted renewed Kharkiv offensive. &quot;Due to the security situation, a decision has been made to intensify evacuation measures for civilians in the Kupiansk district, including the city of Kupiansk,&quot; Syniehubov said on TV. Syniehubov also said that the village of Borova, another strategic foothold for Ukraine in Kharkiv Oblast, would also be evacuated. &quot;The most difficult situation is in the Kupiansk sector. On the east bank of the Oskil River, which divides the city, we can no longer guarantee the restoration of electricity, heat and water supply due to constant shelling,&quot; Syniehubov said, adding that &quot;repair crews immediately come under Russian fire&quot; when attempting to conduct restoration work. Russia has consistently attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an attempt to test Ukrainians&apos; resolve through another cold winter. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian had carried out 26 attacks near Kupiansk over the past day. Russia continues to make marginal advances along difference axis of the front lines, capturing communities in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts. .	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-orders-mandatory-evacuation-from-kupiansk/	2024-10-15T21:39:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1494781604.jpg
Spain seizes 13 tons of chemicals, including 'possible' chemical weapon precursors, bound for Russia	Spanish police seized a total of 13 tons of prohibited chemicals, including &quot;possible&quot; chemical weapon precursors, bound for Russia on Oct. 15, the national police announced. Four suspects were arrested in relation to the seizure and were charged with smuggling banned goods, as they allegedly attempted to circumvent EU sanctions which prohibit the shipping of dual-use chemicals to Russia. &quot;During the investigation, it was proven that internationally sanctioned chemicals, some of them possible precursors for chemical weapons or nerve agents, had been exported in the past using this company structure,&quot; the national police and tax authority said in a statement, according to Reuters. According to investigators, the unspecified chemicals were found inside a shipping container at Barcelona&apos;s port. To smuggle the chemicals, the accused established a Spanish company that would allegedly ship the sanctioned chemicals to a subsidiary in Moscow through shell companies in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. &#xA0; A Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed that Russia&apos;s use of gas attacks is rising. In January, 229 cases were recorded compared to 639 in June and 358 in July, according to the Ukrainian military&apos;s Support Forces, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has recorded over 4,000 cases of Russian chemical agents used on Ukraine&apos;s front line, including over 3,100 reported cases since December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/spain-seizes-13-tons-chemicals-including-possible-chemical-weapon-substances-bound-for-russia/	2024-10-15T20:23:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-1587259334-612x612.jpg
Trust in Zelensky remains relatively high among Ukrainians, poll suggests	President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to command the trust of nearly six in ten Ukrainians, with support remaining stable in recent months, a poll released by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found. According to the survey results released on Oct. 14, 59 per cent of Ukrainians polled hold &quot;trust&quot; in Zelensky while 37 per cent distrust the president. Another 3 per cent of poll respondents were unsure. The results are virtually unchanged from another KIIS survey released in May 2024 and down from a high of 64 per cent in February of this year. Levels of trust in Zelensky have continually decreased from his record-high of 90 per cent in May 2022 - just months following the start of the invasion in February 2022. At that time, only seven per cent of respondents said that they did not have trust in the president. The numbers also draw a stark contrast with level of support for the president this time last year with Zelensky receiving the of 76 per cent of respondents in Oct. 2023 - down 18 percentage points since. Zelensky continues to maintain the trust of a majority of respondents from every region of Ukraine - including a regional high of 62 per cent in the central regions of the country, which includes Kyiv. The president also maintains the trust of 51 per cent of respondents in the country&apos;s war-torn eastern regions, although levels of distrust in eastern Ukraine are among the highest in the country with 45 per cent saying they do not have trust in Zelensky. Despite the steadily declining numbers since the start of the war, Zelensky still commands a level of trust not often seen in Western democracies. For comparison, the average approval of U.S. presidents from 1938-2023 is only 53%. Of the three most recent presidents, only Barack Obama received an average approval rating of more than 50%.

Over 80% of young Germans fear war in Europe, poll suggests	Ongoing wars, the worsening effects of climate change, and increasing political polarization are major concerns for young people in Germany, according to the latest Shell Youth Study. The 2024 edition, titled &quot;Pragmatism Between Disillusionment and Embracing Diversity,&quot; surveyed 2,509 adolescents aged 12 to 25 about their views on politics, society, and the environment. In the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 81% of young respondents expressed concern about the possibility of war in Europe, a sharp rise from 46% in 2019. The fear of poverty also increased, with 67% citing it as a concern, compared to 52% in 2019. The ongoing conflicts, including Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and the recent Hamas attack on Israel, have shifted perspectives. According to the study, 69% of young people aged 15 to 25 support a strong NATO presence, with only 6% opposed. These opinions show little variation between youths in former East and West Germany. &quot;Young people have realized that world politics is not somewhere out there, it cannot be avoided any longer,&quot; said Mathias Albert, political scientist at the University of Bielefeld and one of the study&#x2019;s authors, Deutsche Welle (DW) reported. Regarding Russia&apos;s aggression, 60% of 15 to 25-year-olds agreed that &quot;Russia attacked Ukraine and must be punished for it,&quot; while only 13% disagreed. However, opinions on military support for Ukraine are divided: 50% want Germany to provide military aid, while 24% reject it, with noticeable differences between East and West Germany.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-80-of-young-germans-fear-war-in-europe-poll-suggests/	2024-10-15T16:06:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1240573488.jpg
European Council's Michel invites Zelensky to present victory plan at EU Summit	European Council President Charles Michel announced on Oct. 15 that he had invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to present his victory plan for defeating Russia at a summit of EU leaders this week. Zelensky has been rallying support from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies as the Russian invasion drags into its third year and Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. At the Brussels meeting, EU leaders from 27 nations will discuss military aid to Kyiv and measures to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, which Russian attacks have heavily battered. Last week, Zelensky made a whirlwind tour of European capitals, visiting Berlin, London, Paris, and Rome, as Ukraine braces for a challenging third winter at war. His visits followed the postponement of U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s trip to Germany to handle preparations for Hurricane Milton&#x2019;s approach toward Florida. Zelensky is pushing for renewed military and financial support from Europe amid concerns that backing could weaken if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins next month&apos;s election. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front and target critical energy infrastructure as the winter looms.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-councils-michel-invites-zelensky-to-present-victory-plan-at-eu-summit/	2024-10-15T14:18:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158896695.jpg
Trump declines to say if he’s spoken to Putin since leaving office, media reports	Former President Donald Trump on Oct. 15 declined to confirm if he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office in 2021 but said, &quot;If I did, it&#x2019;s a smart thing.&quot; Trump had previously denied claims from journalist Bob Woodward&#x2019;s book that he had multiple phone calls with Putin after leaving the White House, calling it &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; During an interview with Bloomberg at the Chicago Economic Club, he refused to comment directly on the matter, saying: &quot;If I did, it&#x2019;s a smart thing... If I&#x2019;m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that&#x2019;s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country.&quot; He also reportedly added: &quot;Russia has never had a president that they respect so much.&quot; Earlier, Trump said that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. &quot;I get along very well with Putin. I got; I fully understand what&apos;s happening,&quot; the Republican candidate for U.S. presidency said at a town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, regarding Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-declines-to-say-if-hes-spoken-to-putin-since-leaving-office-media-reports/	2024-10-15T12:50:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
This is how North Korean troops could be used in Russia’s war in Ukraine	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine may have reached a new stage this week, with reports that North Korea has moved from supplying Moscow with weapons to sending its own troops. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it&#x2019;s unclear what kind of soldiers they are. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic defense agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang on June 19, further deepening military ties between the two countries. North Korea has already supplied Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles, but sending troops would mark a significant geopolitical escalation in their cooperation. But according to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, for now at least, it&apos;s a sign of Russian desperation that could have limited effect. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Korean People&apos;s Army (KPA) is the fourth largest in the world in terms of personnel, with 1,280,000 active members and 600,000 in reserve. Only China, India, and the United States have bigger standing armies. North Korea spent 36.32% of its entire gross domestic product on defense in 2023. North Korean society is heavily militarized and all citizens are required to serve &#x2014; reportedly 10 years for men, and eight for women. &quot;National defense is the supreme duty and honor of citizens,&quot; Article 86 of the country&apos;s constitution states. In terms of weaponry, North Korea has a formidable arsenal that has alarmed the international community for decades. The full extent of the country&apos;s nuclear weapons program is not known, but it is believed to have conducted six tests since 2006 and has enough fissile material for 40-50 nuclear missiles.

(Kim Won Jin / AFP via Getty Images)It has also tested intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of carrying nuclear warheads, with a range far enough to strike the U.S. North Korea is also widely believed to have an extensive chemical weapons program. In 2017, Kim Jong Un&apos;s older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was assassinated using the nerve agent VX, in a plot widely accepted as being orchestrated by Pyongyang. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that North Korea&apos;s most exotic and most deadly weaponry is unlikely to play a role in Ukraine, however. &quot;North Korea can provide two things,&quot; said Christoph Bluth, professor of international relations and security at the University of Bradford. &quot;One is cannon fodder, and the other is their vast arsenal of ammunition from the 1950s.&quot; A lot of the latter is already in Ukraine. The Times, citing Western intelligence sources, reported &#xA0;earlier this month that half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky&apos;s recent warnings make clear the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow has now gone beyond just shells and missiles. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 13. According to Bluth, accurately assessing the effectiveness of North Korean troops is difficult, but their quality is likely to be low. &quot;They spend a lot of time in the army, but the quality of equipment they have and the quality of the training are rather dubious,&quot; he said. Then, there is the lure of escaping the authoritarian North Korean regime. According to an Oct. 15 report by Ukrainska Pravda citing Ukraine&#x2019;s intelligence services, 18 have already deserted their positions. &quot;So not only may they be poor soldiers, they may take the opportunity to desert if the opportunity presents itself,&quot; Foreman said.

(Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)What will they be used for?According to two sources, it&apos;s likely that after training, North Korean troops will initially be deployed to Kursk Oblast to defend against Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion launched more than two months ago. The BBC&apos;s James Waterhouse, citing a Ukrainian military source, said Russia &quot;is forming a unit of approximately 3,000 North Korean citizens close to its border with Mongolia in Ulan-Ude&quot; to be deployed in Kursk Oblast. In a post on Telegram, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, added that it can&apos;t be ruled out that they are later stationed in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. &quot;Manpower is the one thing North Korea has that Russia desperately needs,&quot; Bluth said. He adds that while Russia&apos;s disregard for soldiers and its willingness to throw men into &quot;meat assaults&quot; is well documented, in North Korea, the leadership has even less regard for human lives. &quot;Kim Jong Un had his own uncle executed. So he is basically killing as many people as necessary to stay in power,&quot; he said. &quot;Life for North Korean conscripts is brutal and harsh, even without a war, and the consequences for refusing to fight would be extremely dire.&quot; In a press briefing on June 25, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said North Korean troops would become &quot;cannon fodder&quot; if they joined Russian forces on the battlefield in Ukraine. But in order to make any difference on the battlefield, they would have to be present in far larger numbers than what has so far been reported. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia is losing more than 1,000 men per day, meaning 10,000 North Korean troops would only plug a gap for a week or so. Foreman says he doesn&apos;t expect the numbers of North Korean troops currently being reported to &quot;shift the dial dramatically&quot; in Russia&apos;s favor. &quot;It&#x2019;s a clear indicator of how far Russia and its military have fallen over the last two and a half years that it&#x2019;s having to beg, borrow, and buy support from North Korea,&quot; he said. But Dr. Jenny Mathers, Senior Lecturer in International Politics at Aberystwyth University, warns that it could well be just the beginning of North Korea sending troops to Ukraine.

(Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP)&quot;This could just be step one &#x2014; let&apos;s send a small number, see how it works on both sides,&quot; she said. &quot;Can the Russians integrate them, can they find uses for them, overcome language barriers and logistical issues? Can they manage with this relatively small number, and if they can, maybe they&apos;ll scale it up.&quot; Already isolated on the international stage, North Korea has little to lose from joining the war against Ukraine and further angering Kyiv&apos;s Western allies but a lot to gain from deepening relations with Russia. &quot;Russia is on the U.N. Security Council and has been vetoing any resolutions related to human rights or weapons of mass destruction in North Korea,&quot; Bluth points out. &quot;North Korea is basically isolating itself from any path to some sort of relaxation of the tensions with the U.S. or South Korea, so at the moment, North Korea is throwing in its lot with Russia.&quot; Then there are the military benefits. In exchange for ammunition already supplied, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. Bluth said the deployment of troops could strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s hand in obtaining more military technology from Moscow, particularly missile guidance technology. On Oct. 15, White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the U.S. was &quot;concerned&quot; about reports of North Korean troops in Ukraine, but added: &quot;Such a move would also indicate a new level of desperation for Russia as it continues to suffer significant casualties on the battlefield in its brutal war against Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/this-is-how-north-korean-troops-could-be-used-in-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2024-10-15T12:08:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, Western source says	Key developments on Oct. 15: North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia to boost its war efforts against Ukraine, a Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15. Concerns over the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have escalated dramatically this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Russia&apos;s plans for supporting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine would this autumn include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war.&quot; The Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that it&apos;s unclear what kind of soldiers they are or what their roles were. The Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry but did not receive a reply at the time of publication. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) declined to comment. As Russia and North Korea deepen military ties, Western diplomats and experts stress that it shows Moscow&apos;s increasing need for resources to continue waging its costly war in Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s a clear indicator how far Russia and its military have fallen over the last 2.5 years that it&#x2019;s having to beg, borrow and buy support from North Korea,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. Earlier this year, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang. As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. Ukrainian and U.S. officials claim that North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since the fall of 2023. Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during autumn and winter months, Interfax Ukraine reported on Oct. 15, citing comments from National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko. &quot;With the start of the &apos;heating season,&apos; we can expect massive Russian strikes on the energy sector,&quot; Lytvynenko said. The &quot;heating season&quot; refers to the colder period of the year, usually starting in mid-October and lasting until April. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Speaking at the Energy in Industry 2024 exhibition in Kyiv, officials said the Ukrainian energy sector had shown its ability to implement innovative solutions during the war and that Russia failed to destroy Ukraine&apos;s economy. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months as it seeks to plunge the country into a deep freeze aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late September. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. There are no intact buildings or shelters left in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, allowing Russia to occupy new areas of the embattled town, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;Now the town looks more like a desert planet: there are no shelters for civilians or soldiers, and unfortunately, this allows the enemy to occupy new areas, but on scorched earth,&quot; Bobovnikova said. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 15 that Russian troops have advanced in Toretsk over the past day. Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova said that Russian soldiers change their military uniforms for civilian clothes to move toward Ukrainian positions, a tactic they use in other embattled settlements as well. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fighting was taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk. U.S. lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican parties are pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to further lower the age of mandatory military conscription, said Presidential Office advisor Serhii Leshchenko on Oct. 15. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. Another law, signed by the president just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. Leshchenko said that U.S. lawmakers have been pressuring Zelensky and continuing to ask why men aged 18-25 are not being mobilized. &quot;(The) Americans are hinting, Western weapons alone are not enough, we need mobilization from the age of 18.&quot; The unnamed U.S. lawmakers have reportedly cited America&apos;s experience in the Vietnam War, when men aged 18-26 were drafted to fight. Some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight in the war through the selective service process. Leshchenko said that Zelensky has thus far refused to budge on changing the conscription age, and has instead continued to press for the delivery of more U.S. military aid. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. The deadline for updating data expired on July 17, 2024. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured at least 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on the morning of Oct. 15. Ukrainian forces downed 12 out of 17 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Russia also fired seven S-300/400 missiles against Mykolaiv Oblast and two Kh-59 missiles on Chernihiv Oblast overnight, the statement read. A Russian missile strike on the city of Mykolaiv killed a woman and injured at least 23 people, according to Governor Vitalii Kim. The attack damaged an industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars. Three people were injured in the village of Shakhtarske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people suffered injuries in the villages of Zakitne and Riznykivka in the region. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 22 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Four people were killed, and six were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korea-has-sent-10-000-soldiers-to-russia-western-source-says/	2024-10-15T11:44:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
18 North Korean soldiers already deserted positions by Ukraine's border, intelligence sources tell Suspilne	An estimated 18 North Korean soldiers have deserted from their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts near the Ukrainian border, Suspilne reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials. Concerns over the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have escalated dramatically this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Russia&apos;s plans for supporting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine would this autumn include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war.&quot; A Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia to boost its war efforts against Ukraine. According to Suspilne&apos;s sources, the soldiers deserted around 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The motive behind their desertion has not yet been established, but the sources said that the Russian military is searching for the soldiers. Russian commanders are attempting to conceal the soldiers&apos; desertion from their higher-ups, the sources said. Earlier this year, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang.

As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineer unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. Ukrainian and U.S. officials claim that North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since fall of 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-has-sent-10-000-soldiers-to-russia-western-source-says/	2024-10-15T08:11:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157765711.jpg
Gaming platform Steam agrees to remove banned content in Russia, censorship agency says	The video game platform Steam has agreed to remove all content banned in Russia from its online store in the country, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Interfax reported on Oct. 15. The move follows a growing crackdown on social media and other online platforms in Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In September, Russia banned the popular messaging service Discord, becoming the latest social media application to be blocked in the country. Steam, which has an online catalog of more than 100,000 games and is used by around 130 million users around the world, including close to 10 million in Russia, agreed to comply with legislation, the federal censorship agency Roskomnadzor told Interfax. It blocked 11 websites and removed 260 &quot;banned materials&quot; from its platform. Roskomnadzor did not specify what materials it had removed. After Roskomnadzor moved to block the Signal messaging app in August 2024 due to alleged &quot;violations of Russian law,&quot; rumors emerged about plans to block WhatsApp as well. Meanwhile, YouTube has begun experiencing massive outages following reports that the Russian government is planning to block the site completely in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/gaming-platform-steam-agrees-to-remove-banned-content-in-russia/	2024-10-15T07:52:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1659833597.jpg
Zelensky unveiling victory plan on Oct. 16: part will be disclosed only to parliamentary leaders, top lawmaker says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky intends to present his much-debated victory plan during an address to parliament on Oct. 16, with more sensitive details revealed to faction leaders of the legislature, the parliamentary leader of the ruling party told the Kyiv Independent. The Ukrainian leadership has so far revealed only certain points and general outlines of the five-step plan, stopping short of disclosing it in full. Zelensky has already pitched the plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders in an effort to drum up international support behind what Kyiv calls a path toward a just and lasting peace. However, more details are now set to be revealed to Ukrainian lawmakers and the public. David Arakhamia, the leader of Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People parliamentary group, said he expects only part of the plan to be fully declassified during the Oct. 16 session. &quot;I think part will be declassified, and the other part will be presented to the leaders of (parliamentary groups),&quot; Arakhamia said in comments to the Kyiv Independent.

(Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images)Once part of the plan is unveiled in the parliament, it will become accessible to the general public, the lawmaker added. According to Arakhamia, the proposal does not require approval by the legislature. Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko said the purpose of the parliament presentation is to inform lawmakers and society in reaction to &quot;public demand. &quot; Top officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The key components focus on military, diplomatic, and economic areas, as well as post-war reconstruction. Specific steps include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast also plays a role in creating pressure on Moscow. Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal that the proposal encompasses a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles as well as permission to launch them against military targets in Russia, a step that the Western powers have been hesitant to approve. It likely also includes economic assistance and security guarantees for Ukraine and stepping up sanctions and diplomatic pressure against Russia, Fesenko said. Some parts of the plan will not be disclosed to the general public, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff Andrii Yermak has said. &quot;The purpose of the plan is to strengthen our positions and force Russia to agree to realistic and just peace negotiations,&quot; Fesenko said, adding that the plan would aim to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war and increase the cost of the war for Russia. Western partners have mostly remained tight-lipped about their opinion of the victory plan. While the U.S. State Department said diplomatically that the proposal includes &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; some partners were &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the plan, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 25. Several Western officials believe it leans too heavily on additional arms supplies and on lifting restrictions on their use and does not bring many new ideas to the table, the outlet wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Fesenko said it&apos;s &quot;too early to make fatal conclusions&quot; about the West&apos;s reaction to the victory plan. He added that there is so far neither a positive response nor a negative one from the West to Ukraine&apos;s requests to receive permission to strike Russia with long-range weapons and to become a NATO member. Zelensky intended to reveal the victory plan to Ukraine&apos;s Western allies at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting at Germany&apos;s Ramstein airbase on Oct. 12, but the gathering was canceled after outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden aborted his overseas travel due to Hurricane Milton at home. While the U.S. president will visit Germany on Oct. 18, no new date for a Ramstein summit has been set. According to Fesenko, the Ramstein meeting would likely not bring any major strategic decisions as &quot;Biden&apos;s indecisiveness has devalued the meaning&quot; of the summits. Time is of the essence for Ukraine, with only three weeks remaining before the U.S. presidential election, where Biden&apos;s Vice President Kamal Harris, as the Democratic Party candidate, is facing off with former president Donald Trump. The result may profoundly impact Washington&apos;s support for Kyiv in the short and long term. There are worries that if Trump, the Republican nominee, returns to the White House, he might scale down his country&apos;s crucial support, forcing Ukraine toward painful concessions. The U.S. pulling out would only aggravate the already grim situation for Ukraine, as Russian forces keep grinding on in the east, and the country, with some 20% of its territory occupied by Russia&apos;s invading forces, braces for more strikes on the energy sector during the upcoming winter. &quot;In October, November, and December, we have a real chance to move things toward peace and lasting stability. The situation on the battlefield creates an opportunity to make this choice &#x2014; the choice for decisive action to end the war no later than in 2025,&quot; Zelensky said at the Ukraine-South East Europe summit last week.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-present-victory-plan-to-ukraines-parliament-on-oct-16/	2024-10-15T06:15:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Finnish FM warns about growing Ukraine fatigue among Western allies	The Western countries are growing tired of their support of Ukraine, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen warned, calling for stronger resolve in backing Kyiv, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 15. &quot;It&apos;s real. And increasingly so,&quot; Valtonen said about the Western fatigue, saying that some partners are hoping for a faster resolution. Concerns about the future of Western support grow as the uncertain U.S. election draws near. Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump said he wants to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, sparking fears that Washington, which has spearheaded the pro-Kyiv alliance, might scale down or withdraw its support. According to Finland&apos;s diplomacy chief, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has also diverted attention and resources from Ukraine. &quot;These two conflicts are, of course, very much linked, but for us Europeans, it would be important to realize that if we allow Russia to win in Ukraine, then essentially we end the credibility of our deterrence,&quot; Valtonen commented. The hostilities in the Middle East only continue to grow in scope as Israel launched strikes against the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon while war continues to rage further south in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas, the latter of which launched an attack against Israel last October, are backed by Iran. In turn, Tehran has forged close ties with Russia over the past few years, supplying Moscow with drones and missiles for war against Ukraine. Facing the war&apos;s mounting economic and social pressures and the allies&apos; weakening resolve, President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a &quot;decisive action&quot; among international partners to end the war by 2025. The president is trying to drum up international support behind his country&apos;s victory plan, which has been presented to Western leaders and will be partially unveiled to the public on Oct. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-fm-warns-about-growing-ukraine-fatigue-among-western-allies/	2024-10-15T06:00:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/--------------2024-05-29-165945.png
Trump holds sight lead over Harris in battleground states in early voting, poll shows	Former U.S. President Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris among early American voters in battleground states, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, The Hill reported on Oct. 14. A total of 48% of voters who said they would vote early in so-called swing states supported Trump, while 47% sided with Harris. Another 5% said they went with another choice or had not yet voted. The upcoming U.S. 2024 presidential election can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. Trump&apos;s views on Ukraine and the war are causing fears that he might scale down or withdraw military support if re-elected this November. Harris, Trump&apos;s opponent in the upcoming vote, has lambasted Trump for his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other dictators. A total of seven U.S. states &#x2014;Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin &#x2014; are believed to be crucial in the presidential election this year. The elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. The survey showed that among all voters in the key battleground states, Republican nominee Trump is up by 2 points, with 48% support to Harris&apos; 46%. In turn, Harris is ahead of Trump by 8 points among voters who have already voted across the country, with 51% to Trump&apos;s 43%. The survey, conducted from Oct. 11 to 13, used a representative sample of 3,145 registered voters, including 898 from battleground states.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-harris-early-voting/	2024-10-15T05:50:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171848317.jpg
NATO will do what's necessary for Ukraine to prevail, Secretary General Rutte says	NATO will not back down in the face of Russian threats and maintain its support for Ukraine, Secretary General Mark Rutte said in comments for Reuters published on Oct. 14. &quot;The message (to Russian President Vladimir Putin) is that we will continue, that we will do what&apos;s necessary to make sure that he will not get his way, that Ukraine will prevail,&quot; Rutte said during a joint interview with Reuters and German radio Hessischer Rundfunk on Oct. 13. Despite Rutte&apos;s assurances, there are growing concerns about the future of Western support as the uncertain U.S. election draws near. Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump said he wants to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, sparking fears he might scale down or withdraw support. NATO&apos;s secretary general made the comments during his first visit to the allied mission for Ukraine in Germany&apos;s Wiesbaden. The mission, named NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), is meant to take over the coordination of Western aid for Kyiv. According to Reuters, the body is widely seen as a way to safeguard assistance in case of Trump&apos;s return. Under U.S. President Joe Biden, Washington has been the leader of the pro-Kyiv coalition, providing by far the greatest volumes of military supplies. &quot;We are NATO. We are a defensive alliance... We are not interested in capturing any part of any other country outside NATO territory,&quot; Rutte commented. &quot;As this democratic alliance, the strongest military alliance in world history, serving 1 billion people, we stand ready to confront any threat. We will never get intimidated by our adversaries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-nato-russia-ukraine/	2024-10-15T05:02:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1522782667.jpg
Wave of bomb threats proven false, most came from Russian IP addresses, police say	The police have examined more than 2,000 messages with bomb threats sent out across Ukraine, the National Police said on Oct. 15, launching a full investigation. Hundreds of Ukrainian schools, businesses, embassies, administrative buildings, and media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, received bomb threats via email on Oct. 14, prompting evacuations of state institutions. Following their examination of the incident, the police said that all threats turned out to be false. The vast majority of messages reportedly came from Russian IP addresses. &quot;Such messages match the style of Russian intelligence services, which are waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, trying to cause mass panic and exhaust state and law enforcement agencies,&quot; the police said on Oct. 15. The threats appeared to be connected to a recent investigation conducted by Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) into Russian security services&apos; sabotage efforts in Ukraine. The sender claimed to represent a &quot;terrorist group&quot; and said that three of RFE/RL&apos;s investigative journalists should consider themselves responsible for the attack. The group&apos;s name matches that of an anti-Ukrainian Telegram channel that disseminates calls to set fire to cars belonging to Ukrainian military personnel. RFE/RL&apos;s investigative project, Schemes, published a report on Oct. 10 documenting how Russian security services recruit Ukrainians, including minors, to burn cars belonging to military personnel and enlistment officials. The journalists who authored the report were those named in the threatening email. &quot;We will not be intimidated and stand behind our reporters who will continue to bring news to Ukrainian audiences without fear or favor,&quot; RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said. Capus pledged to cooperate with authorities in the investigation.	https://kyivindependent.com/bomb-threats-ukraine/	2024-10-15T04:30:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1436365815.jpg
Opinion: The Russian opposition needs to stop blaming Putin and start confronting Russia's violent imperial legacy	&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point of a world without Russia in it?&#x201D; asked a well-known politician, now a wanted war criminal, back in 2018. A less prominent Russian figure echoed this sentiment in 2024, though less threateningly, when he remarked, &#x201C;The disintegration of Russia would be a catastrophe, not only for our country and people but a tragedy for the world. The first quote belongs to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the second to one of his biggest critics, dissident Illya Yashin. Despite their many disagreements, both appear oblivious to the root cause of Moscow&#x2019;s aggression &#x2013; an empire built on violence and deceit, masquerading as a nation. Neither is willing to confront this foundational lie that anchors their country&#x2019;s politics, culture, and self-conception. Age-old Russian colonialism &#x2013; manifested this century in wars against Ichkeria, Georgia, and Ukraine &#x2013; endures not through any single leader or regime but through a mindset ingrained in the collective psyche. Rooted in centuries of conquest, Moscow reframes aggression as defense, shielding Russian society from confronting its role in sustaining the empire and its violence. Yashin attributed his fears of Russia&#x2019;s collapse to the issue of &quot;loose nukes&quot; &#x2013; a concern well-known to American policymakers. This echoes the famous Chicken Kyiv speech, where U.S. President George H.W. Bush urged Ukrainians to remain in the Soviet Union. While the U.S. was preoccupied with worries about what could go wrong if the Soviet Union ceased to exist, Ukrainians saw this as betrayal. Did Washington truly fail to grasp Russia&#x2019;s brutal imperial history? Was the Holodomor &#x2013; a famine engineered by Moscow to kill millions of Ukrainians and crush their national movement &#x2013; not enough evidence of this? The new icon of the Russian opposition, Yulia Navalnaya, who took up her late husband&#x2019;s mantle, offered starkly different arguments: &#x201C;There are those who advocate for the urgent &#x2018;decolonization&#x2019; of Russia, arguing to split our vast country into smaller, safer states. However, these &#x2018;de-colonizers&#x2019; can&#x2019;t explain why people with shared backgrounds and cultures should be artificially divided.&#x201D; To grasp how absurd, yet offensive, this statement is, one only needs to recall Putin&#x2019;s rationale for the criminal war Moscow is waging on Ukraine. The &#x201C;brotherly people&#x201D; rhetoric has been used by Russia&#x2019;s tyrannical rulers for centuries. How did people in Tatarstan, Dagestan, or the Sakha Republic come to &#x201C;share backgrounds&#x201D; with Muscovites? Because they were all colonized. Unlike other empires, Moscow&#x2019;s didn&#x2019;t rely on racial exclusion. &#x201C;Instead, it was based on the no-less violent &#x2018;idea of sameness,&#x2019; meaning the colonized were forced to surrender their identity and adopt the norms of the colonizer,&#x201D; explained Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko. Another prominent member of the Russian opposition, Vladimir Kara-Murza, gave an interview to The Guardian and chose to highlight one quote in his recent tweet: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just the Russian people, in his view, who need to take collective responsibility, but Western leaders too, who &#x2018;for all these years were buying gas from Putin, inviting him to international summits, rolling out red carpets.&#x2019;&#x201D; Zahar Navalny (L), Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (2L), Russian journalist Maria Pevchikh (C), film producer Odessa Rae (2R), and Dasha Navalnaya (R) attend the 2023 Vanity Fair Oscar party in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on March 12, 2023. (Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)He is undeniably a brave person, and I am convinced that his intentions are genuine. Yet, even the most enlightened thinkers among the self-professed Russian opposition cannot help but try to find someone else to blame for the war crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine, absolving them of responsibility or at least spreading it thin. By portraying the Russian people as passive victims of Putin&#x2019;s regime, opposition figures are paradoxically validating Putinism &#x2013; the latest reincarnation of a Moscow-centric colonial system of subjugation masked as nationalism. Rather than owning up to collective responsibility, the opposition continues to separate the Russian populace from the actions of their state, effectively reinforcing a culture of denial and complicity rather than challenging it. Kara-Murza&#x2019;s common appeal to Western leaders can be summarized as: don&#x2019;t punish the people. Who could argue against it? But the deeper meaning and symbolism matter. If Putin and his clique are to answer for all the wrongs while the 140 million Russians are absolved of their responsibility, how will they learn that apathy enables injustice? And when will they confront Russia&apos;s bloodstained history, let alone atone for it? While many in the West would like to believe that the Russian people are merely victims of state propaganda, the reality is more complicated. Jade McGlynn, in her book &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s War,&#x201D; argues that &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine is popular with large numbers of Russians and acceptable to an even larger number.&#x201D; This complicity cannot be explained solely by fear of the regime. &#x201C;Putin doesn&#x2019;t shape Russian views on foreign policy or Ukraine so much as he articulates them,&#x201D; she explained. McGlynn points out that many Russians accept Moscow&apos;s narrative because the alternative &#x2013; admitting they are complicit in a genocidal war &#x2013; would be too painful. This mass delusion, coupled with the dehumanization of Ukrainians, sets off a vicious cycle permitting widespread support for or ambivalence toward atrocities. I&#x2019;ve encountered two distinct perspectives on the Russian opposition. The first posits that anyone standing up to Putin is on the right side of history and deserves support. The second contends that figures like Yashin, Navalnaya, and Kara-Murza often do more harm than good &#x2013; calling for the lifting of sanctions, promising democracy in Russia (which, to me, seems impossible without decolonization), and condemning Putin while failing to confront the deeper sources of Russian aggression: stripping people of their agency, perpetuating a narrative of grievance, and sustaining the grand lie of Russia&#x2019;s nationhood. I disagree with neither of those views, and both can be true at the same time. Undoubtedly, there are individuals in Russia or in exile who bravely resist Putin&#x2019;s regime, but the term &quot;Russian opposition&quot; warrants scrutiny. &#x201C;Russia&#x201D; is synonymous with imperialism and subjugation, while &#x201C;opposition&#x201D; stands for democracy, freedom, and accountability &#x2013; concepts that are fundamentally incompatible. As long as Russia clings to its imperial ethos, criticism of Putin will merely confront the consequences, not the root cause of wanton violence.

As long as Russia clings to its imperial ethos, criticism of Putin will merely confront the consequences, not the root cause of wanton violence.

Hungary wants to increase gas purchases from Russia's Gazprom in 2025	Budapest and Russia&apos;s state-owned gas company Gazprom are in talks on additional purchases next year, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview with Kremlin-run RIA Novosti published on Oct. 15. The move would likely increase Hungary&apos;s reliance on Russian gas despite the EU&apos;s efforts to wean itself off Russian supplies. &quot;Basically, we will increase the volumes. We have already signed one (agreement) for the last quarter of this year, which covers additional (gas) volumes at a price that ensures competitive prices,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;We are currently negotiating a deal for next year.&quot; This agreement will include greater volumes thanks to the capacity of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline, running from Russia to Europe through the Black Sea, the minister noted. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Gazprom and Hungary&apos;s MVM energy company signed a memorandum of understanding on increasing gas supplies at a forum in St. Petersburg on Oct. 10. Budapest is also a major buyer of Russian oil, and one of the few countries in the EU granted an exemption to continue buying pipeline oil via the Druzhba pipeline. According to Szijjarto&apos;s comments from June, Russian fossil fuel supplies cover roughly 70-80% of Hungary&apos;s yearly demand. While the EU has reduced dependency on Russian gas, some of it keeps flowing to Europe through pipelines and as LNG, with the sales profits feeding Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv has said it will not extend the deal allowing the gas transit to the EU through its territory past its December 2024 expiration date. Europe and Ukraine are in talks with Azerbaijan about alternative gas supplies.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-wants-to-increase-gazprom-gas-purchases-in-2025/	2024-10-15T04:10:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure at least 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured at least 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on the morning of Oct. 15. Ukrainian forces downed 12 out of 17 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Russia also fired seven S-300/400 missiles against Mykolaiv Oblast and two Kh-59 missiles on Chernihiv Oblast overnight, the statement read. A Russian missile strike on the city of Mykolaiv killed a woman and injured at least 23 people, according to Governor Vitalii Kim. The attack damaged an industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Mykolaiv overnight on Oct. 15, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Three people were injured in the village of Shakhtarske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people suffered injuries in the villages of Zakitne and Riznykivka in the region. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 22 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Four people were killed, and six were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine/	2024-10-15T03:38:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-15_08-04-22.jpg
Russia may resume strikes on Ukraine's energy sector in autumn, winter, official warns	Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during autumn and winter months, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 15, Interfax Ukraine reported. &quot;With the start of the &apos;heating season,&apos; we can expect massive Russian strikes on the energy sector,&quot; Lytvynenko said. The &quot;heating season&quot; refers to the colder period of the year, usually starting in mid-October and lasting until April. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Speaking at the Energy in Industry 2024 exhibition in Kyiv, officials said the Ukrainian energy sector had shown its ability to implement innovative solutions during the war, and that Russia failed to destroy Ukraine&apos;s economy. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late September. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-autumn-winter/	2024-10-15T02:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154248575.jpg
Zelensky's advisor responds to allegations of pressure on Ukrainska Pravda, calls it 'incorrect story'	Ukraine&apos;s presidential adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, called Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s allegations of pressure from the Presidential Office &quot;an incorrect story&quot; in an interview with Liga.net published on Oct. 15. Lytvyn&apos;s reaction came after almost a week of silence after Ukrainska Pravda, one of Ukraine&apos;s leading newspapers, claimed that the Ukrainian government is exerting &quot;systematic pressure&quot; against the outlet. In a statement published on Oct. 9, the newspaper said that officials are being ordered not to communicate with Ukrainska Pravda journalists, who are also being denied access to official events. The outlet further claimed that businesses are being pressured to cease advertising on the outlet&apos;s website and not sponsor the events Ukrainska Pravda organizes. In a follow-up article published the next day, Ukrainska Pravda said, without disclosing its sources, that one of the leading figures of this campaign is Lytvyn, who has been President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speechwriter and was appointed his advisor in September. When asked about the allegations, Lytvyn said that he did not have his own version of events. &quot;It is impossible to make any effective refutation in this story. When you say that you are not doing something, who will believe it? If so many people say the opposite,&quot; Lytvyn said. &quot;This story is very incorrect. They say something abstract, and you have to refute it as if it were something concrete,&quot; he added. Lytvyn claimed that Ukrainska Pravda had never asked him for comment or questions in almost three years. In a comment to Liga.net, Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Romaniuk said the publication had sent a request to the Presidential Office regarding a heated interaction between their journalist Roman Kravets and Zelensky during a recent press conference. Since this request was ignored, Ukrainska Pravda did not reach out to the Presidential Office again before publishing the article about government pressure, said Romaniuk, the author of the piece. Ukraine&apos;s independent media has taken great strides since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but concerns have been raised since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#x200B;&#x200B;Reporters Without Borders (RSF) indicated in June the &quot;shrinking&quot; of press freedom in Ukraine, highlighting a &quot;worrying decline&quot; in support and respect for media autonomy and increased pressure from the state or other political actors inside Ukraine. The statement came one month after the annual press freedom index published by RSF showed Ukraine rising compared to last year. As the Kyiv Independent reported in July, media still face different forms of pressure from authorities, according to Ukrainian editors and press freedom watchdogs, months after attacks on investigative journalists provoked a public outcry and condemnation. &quot;We have often encountered pressure in our work. But the last time we faced such economic restrictions was during the presidency of (Leonid) Kuchma,&quot; Sevgil Musayeva, editor-in-chief of Ukrainska Pravda, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 9, referring to Ukraine&apos;s president from 1994-2005. Since being founded in 2000, two journalists from Ukrainska Pravda have been killed &#x2014; co-founder Georgiy Gongadze, and top editor Pavel Sheremet. Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv. &#x200B;&#x200B;Belarusian-born Sheremet was blown up in his car in central Kyiv on July 20, 2016. Musayeva stressed the importance of making public the pressure Ukrainska Pravda is facing and called on international audiences to take note. &quot;Ukraine must remain a democracy, and freedom of speech is one of the most important values in a free society,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-advisor-responds-to-accusations-of-pressure-on-ukrainska-pravda/	2024-10-15T01:45:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-15-111949.png
Kyiv denies media reports about supplying drones to Mali rebels	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Oct. 14 rejected &quot;accusations spread by some international media&quot; about Kyiv&apos;s involvement in drone supplies for Malian rebels. The statement comes after an article by the French outlet Le Monde claimed that Tuareg fighters from the anti-government CSP movement are using Ukrainian drones against the government forces and their Wagner allies. According to Le Monde&apos;s report, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) has been cooperating with Malian rebels since early 2024. Citing a source close to HUR, the outlet also wrote that Ukrainian specialists arrived in the Sahel region to train the rebels, and some CSP members received training in Ukraine. In July, Russian Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers reportedly suffered heavy losses in an engagement with Tuareg rebels. The Russian mercenary group, known for its deployment in Ukraine and short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin last year, has a strong presence across the African continent, backing Russian business interests and Moscow-friendly regimes. After the rebel victory became public, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence spokesperson, Andrii Yusov, said that the rebels were receiving &quot;useful information, and not just that, which allowed them to carry out a successful military operation against Russian war criminals.&quot; This was understood by the Malian government as an admission of Ukraine&apos;s support for the rebels, after which it broke off diplomatic relations with Kyiv. Neighboring Niger soon followed suit. &quot;We also categorically deny all the regular accusations made by the high-ranking officials of the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Niger that Ukraine is allegedly involved in &apos;cooperation with terrorists,&apos; &apos;arms supplies and providing them with information,&apos; &apos;support to the terrorist coalition,&apos; etc.,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in its Oct. 14 statement. Kyiv denied claims by Niger and Mali already in August, saying that the steps of the two African countries were made under Russian influence. The ministry also denied accusations about supplying weapons and equipment provided by Kyiv&apos;s partners as assistance against Russian aggression. &quot;From the first months of the Russian full-scale invasion, it was Ukraine that first initiated the introduction of an extensive system of monitoring and control over the weapons supplied to our state by Western partners,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;Once again, we emphasize that Ukraine remains committed to the further development of mutually beneficial relations with all African states,&quot; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-denies-media-reports-about-supplying-drones-to-mali-rebels/	2024-10-15T01:05:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2157390795.jpg
No intact buildings left' in Toretsk, accelerating Russian advance, military says	There are no intact buildings or shelters left in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, allowing Russia to occupy new areas of the embattled town, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;Now the town looks more like a desert planet: there are no shelters for civilians or soldiers, and unfortunately, this allows the enemy to occupy new areas, but on scorched earth,&quot; Bobovnikova said. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 15 that Russian troops have advanced in Toretsk over the past day. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Toretsk as of Oct. 14, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova said that Russian soldiers change their military uniforms for civilian clothes to move toward Ukrainian positions, a tactic they use in other embattled settlements as well. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11 while the rest has been captured by Russia. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/toretsk-destruction/	2024-10-14T23:30:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608183.jpg
Trump implies Putin told him about his designs for Ukraine	Donald Trump said on Oct. 14 that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. &quot;I get along very well with Putin. I got; I fully understand what&apos;s happening,&quot; the Republican candidate for U.S. presidency said at a town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, regarding Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in.&quot; The former president repeated his assertion that there &quot;wouldn&apos;t be a war between Russia and Ukraine&quot; if he had been in the White House instead of Joe Biden in the past years. Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine began in 2014 with the occupation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas, with hostilities ongoing throughout Trump&apos;s presidential term of 2017-2021. Speaking at the event, Trump also claimed he &quot;(gets) along very well with (Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr) Zelensky,&quot; highlighting their meeting in New York during the Ukrainian president&apos;s visit to the U.S. During their meeting in late September, Trump again praised his relationship with both Zelensky and Putin. Zelensky also met with President Biden and Trump&apos;s rival in the upcoming vote, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump&apos;s boasting about good ties with Putin has contributed to the concerns about his future policy toward Ukraine should he become president. Excerpts from U.S. journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, &quot;War,&quot; claim that Trump has spoken to Putin seven times since leaving office in 2021 and secretly sent the Russian president Covid testing devices during his presidency. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-ukraine/	2024-10-14T23:15:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178454704.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 671,400 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 671,400 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 15. This number includes 1,210 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,988 tanks, 17,939 armored fighting vehicles, 26,654 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,430 artillery systems, 1,231 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,019 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-671-400-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-14T22:23:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2003918251.jpeg
Russian missile attack on Mykolaiv kills 1, injures 16	A Russian missile attack against the southern city of Mykolaiv overnight on Oct. 15 killed a woman and injured 16 other people, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Russian forces struck the city with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles at around 2:30 a.m. An industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars were damaged, according to the governor. Three victims were treated on an outpatient basis. First responders had extinguished the resulting fires in the city&apos;s residential district that covered the areas of 30 and 400 square meters, the State Emergency Service reported.

Ukrainians in occupied territories to lose free medication without Russian passports	Starting in 2025, Ukrainians with diabetes, bronchial asthma, and other illnesses in Russian-occupied territories will lose access to free medications unless they acquire Russian passports, according to the Eastern Human Rights Group. This practice has already been enforced in Starobilsk, Luhansk Oblast, where residents without Russian citizenship are denied medical services and medications under social programs. Patients must also be registered and included in a specific registry to receive this aid, the human rights group wrote on Facebook. The move further pressures Ukrainians in occupied areas to accept Russian citizenship or face severe health consequences. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center condemned this policy as an act of genocide aimed at erasing the Ukrainian identity. Russia systematically coerces residents of the occupied parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts to accept Russian passports, the U.S. research group Ukraine Conflict Observatory reported on Aug. 2. On July 21, the National Resistance Center said that Russian occupation authorities in some parts of Kherson Oblast force the residents to accept Russian passports under the threat of deportation. In other cases, those who hold on to their Ukrainian passports reportedly face losing their property rights, prison sentences, and mobilization into the Russian army. According to the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, Russia&apos;s methods constitute a serious violation of international law, as the Hague Convention of 1907 forbids to &quot;compel the inhabitants of occupied territory to swear allegiance to the hostile Power.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-in-occupied-territories-to-lose-free-medication-without-russian-passports/	2024-10-14T21:53:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1242332025.jpg
Pro-Kremlin lawmaker from Fico's party visits Moscow, apologizes for EU policies	Lubos Blaha, a senior lawmaker from Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s pro-Russian Smer (Direction) party, visited Moscow on Oct. 12. Blaha posted a four-minute Telegram video, walking across the Red Square, praising Russia as &quot;beautiful, wise, and advanced,&#x201D; and calling for an end to hatred towards the country. He stated that he travelled to Russia in order to &quot;give thanks for the liberation from fascism&quot; and apologize for Western &quot;Russophobia.&quot; Blaha then paid tribute to Soviet commander Georgy Zhukov and commented on the &quot;Slavic brotherhood&quot; between Slovakia and Russia, repeating common Kremlin propaganda points used to justify the invasion of Ukraine. He also criticized the European Parliament&#x2019;s resolutions against Russia, and said that he opposes further military aid to Ukraine as well as Western sanctions against Russia, echoing Fico&#x2019;s stance. Fico halted military aid to Ukraine after taking office in September 2023. The move was a stark reversal of Slovak foreign policy. Following Fico&#x2019;s rise to power, Slovakia embarked on a path very similar to its southern neighbor Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s Russia-friendly leadership has been a consistent thorn in the side of EU and NATO unity regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-kremlin-lawmaker-from-ficos-party-visits-moscow-apologizes-for-eu-policies/	2024-10-14T20:39:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/blaha--1-.jpg
EU mission to train military in Ukraine to be extended by two years, Borrell says	On Oct. 14, EU foreign ministers discussed extending the European Union Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which trains Ukrainian military forces. Josep Borrell, the European Union&#x2019;s top diplomat, emphasized the immense pressure on Ukraine&apos;s military, stating that &quot;we must provide them with more capabilities and strengthen our training mission.&quot; He confirmed plans to extend the EUMAM mandate for another two years, pending approval from the EU Council. EUMAM, established in 2022, conducts training primarily in Poland and Germany. Borrell promised to visit Ukraine once a final decision is made. He also mentioned progress in unblocking frozen European Peace Facility funds, which reimburse EU countries for military aid to Ukraine. Hungary, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-proximate EU member, has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine on account that it &quot;prolongs&quot; and &quot;escalates&quot; the ongoing war. These views have been often echoed in Slovakia since Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico took office last fall. A proposed reform of the European Peace Facility (EPF) would make financial contributions voluntary, aiming to bypass Hungary&apos;s veto on military aid to Ukraine, which has caused a 6.5 billion euro ($7 billion) backlog.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-mission-to-train-military-in-ukraine-to-be-extended-by-two-years-borrell-says/	2024-10-14T18:31:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1984862021.jpeg
Threatening emails sent to Ukrainian organizations after media investigation into Russian security services	Hundreds of Ukrainian schools, businesses, embassies, and media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, received bomb threats via email on Oct. 14, prompting evacuations of state institutions. The threats appeared to be connected to a recent investigation conducted by Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) into Russian security services&apos; sabotage efforts in Ukraine. &quot;I have planted several explosive devices in your building, and very soon it will explode,&quot; the email received by the Kyiv Independent said. The email, while otherwise vague as to &quot;your building,&quot; did list some other addresses as targets, including the RFE/RL office and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. The threats lead authorities to carry out searches for explosives at a number of organizations, RFE/RL reported. The police did not find any evidence of an explosive device at the outlet&apos;s office in Kyiv. The sender claimed to represent a &quot;terrorist group&quot; and said that three of RFE/RL&apos;s investigative journalists should consider themselves responsible for the attack. The group&apos;s name matches that of an anti-Ukrainian Telegram channel that disseminates calls to set fire to cars belonging to Ukrainian military personnel. RFE/RL&apos;s investigative project, Schemes, published a report on Oct. 10 documenting how Russian security services recruit Ukrainians, including minors, to burn cars belonging to military personnel and conscription center representatives. The journalists who authored the report were those named in the threatening email. &quot;We will not be intimidated and stand behind our reporters who will continue to bring news to Ukrainian audiences without fear or favor,&quot; RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said. Capus pledged to cooperate with authorities in investigating the incident.	https://kyivindependent.com/threatening-emails-sent-to-ukrainian-organizations-after-media-investigation-into-russian-security-services/	2024-10-14T16:16:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1927264471.jpg
Brazil must arrest Putin if he attends G20, Ukraine's Prosecutor General says	Brazil is obligated to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he attends the Group of 20 nations (G20) summit in Rio de Janeiro next month, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin told Reuters in an interview published Oct. 14. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in March 2023 issued a warrant for Putin&apos;s arrest due to his role in the deportation of Ukrainian children. Brazil is a party to the ICC&apos;s Rome Statute and therefore required to detain Putin if he enters the country. Intelligence reports indicate that Putin may attend the upcoming summit, Kostin told Reuters. &quot;(I)t&apos;s important for the international community to stand united and hold Putin accountable,&quot; Kostin said. Brazil issued a standard invitation to Putin for the summit, which will convene heads of state of G20 nations in Rio de Janeiro Nov. 18-19. There has been no indication that Putin plans to attend, two Brazilian government officials told Reuters. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Oct. 14 that no decision has been made as to Putin&apos;s attendance at the conference. In light of &quot;information that Putin may attend the G20 summit in Brazil, I would like to reiterate that it&apos;s an obligation for the Brazilian authorities as a state party of the Rome Statute to arrest him if he dares to visit,&quot; Kostin said. &quot;I truly hope that Brazil will arrest him, reaffirming its status as a democracy and a state governed by the rule of law.&quot; Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in September 2023 that the decision to detain Putin at the G20 would be left to his country&apos;s judiciary. Putin visited Mongolia, an ICC member state, in September of this year, his first such visit since his arrest warrant was made public. Despite Mongolia&apos;s obligation under international law to arrest Putin, the Russian president received a warm welcome in Ulaanbaatar. Ukrainian lawmakers described Putin&apos;s Mongolia visit as &quot;a well-planned provocation&quot; meant to show his indifference to the rule of law.	https://kyivindependent.com/brazil-must-arrest-putin-if-he-attends-g20-ukraines-prosecutor-general-says/	2024-10-14T14:08:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1238531446.jpg
Precarious road to Republican US support of Ukraine runs through evangelicals	In the final weeks of campaigning for the U.S. election, a top focus of Donald Trump has been rebooting a wave of evangelical support that proved crucial to his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll tell you another (group) that don&#x2019;t vote, I love these people, evangelical Christians,&#x201D; Trump, the Republican party&#x2019;s presidential candidate, said at a rally on October 6. &#x201C;If (evangelicals) did vote, we couldn&#x2019;t lose an election.&#x201D; However, in the run up to the high-stakes election, where Trump seeks a second term, he isn&apos;t the only one courting evangelicals. The mostly conservative group has for months been a focus of Ukrainian lobbying efforts seeking to expand and cement Republican support for Ukraine. The hope is that by exposing Russia&#x2019;s genocidal war against Ukraine as one that involves Moscow persecuting and killing Christians, including evangelicals, Americans in Trump&#x2019;s MAGA movement &#x2014; specifically the influential religious right &#x2014; could shift their position toward supporting Ukraine. Instead of echoing Trump in questioning American support for Ukraine in its existential fight for survival, efforts underway aim to convert them to a pro-Ukrainian stance &#x2014; reaching out to help Ukraine as the victim, not Russia as the aggressor.

(Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#xA0;Such efforts proved effective in getting House Speaker Mike Johnson, an evangelical himself, to allow Ukraine&apos;s half-year-delayed $61 million aid package to pass in April. But with nearly 80% of evangelicals voting for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and 62% of Republicans saying the U.S. is not responsible for helping Ukraine, long-term backing from Johnson and the influential evangelicals base of Trump&#x2019;s MAGA movement isn&#x2019;t a given come election day on Nov. 5. Johnson made this reality clear on Oct. 11, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t have an appetite for further Ukraine funding, and I hope it&apos;s not necessary.&quot; &quot;If President Trump wins, I believe that he actually can bring that conflict to a close. I really do. I think he&apos;ll call (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that this is enough,&quot; Johnson added in an interview with Punchbowl News. Mark Sergeyev, a displaced person from Russian-occupied Melitopol in Ukraine&apos;s southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is one of the many evangelicals brought to the U.S. in recent months. In July, he took a break from volunteering as a chaplain on the front lines to travel to Washington. He carried with him a message for Congress: Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion is a &#x201C;spiritual war&#x201D; against Ukraine and Western civilization. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a fifth-generation evangelical Christian, my parents, they were always evangelical Christians and they&#x2019;ve been persecuted,&#x201D; Sergeyev said in his testimony before lawmakers. &#x201C;Russians are making a weapon of religion, and they are trying to make my father use the role of spiritual leader to praise their invasion,&#x201D; he added, describing what he recalled as a chaotic scene outside his church in early 2022 when Russian soldiers threatened his father if he didn&#x2019;t record a video in front of the church saying Melitopol is Russian territory. From the 2014 Russian killing of Ukrainian Protestants in Slovyansk when Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region to the destruction of 600 houses of worship in the full-scale invasion&#x2019;s first two and a half years, Sergeyev&#x2019;s testimony has historical undertones. To make his message more relatable for the conservative American lawmakers in the room, Sergeyev referenced the famous televangelist Joel Osteen and his Texas megachurch. &quot;I was born in a free country, my father was a senior pastor of Melitipol Christian Church,&#x201D; Sergeyev said in his testimony. &#x201C;Some American visitors often compare us to Joel Olsteen&apos;s Lakewood Church from Houston &#x2026; we have a big stage, a big worship team.&quot; Following Sergeyev&#x2019;s testimony, Republican Senator from Mississippi Roger Wicker said, &#x201C;Our witnesses today remind us of a tragically overlooked victim of the dictator Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, and that&#x2019;s the Ukrainian evangelical community,&#x201D; according to Steven Moore, a Kyiv-based former Republican staffer on the Hill who testified with Sergeyev and spoke with the Kyiv Independent. The U.S.-based nonprofit Defenders of Faith and Religious Freedom in Ukraine took Sergeyev to Washington. The group is one of the many organizations that, along with evangelical leaders and lobbying groups, believe that the road to winning over and sustaining U.S. and Republican Party support for Ukraine is through America&#x2019;s evangelical Christian communities. There are nearly 90 million evangelicals in the U.S., 82% of whom are polled to vote for Trump in November. While their turnout is critical for Trump&#x2019;s election chances, their voting will also help shape which party controls the U.S. legislature and future foreign policy.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As such, winning over their hearts and minds is key for Kyiv&#x2019;s long-term survival and hopes of victory over Russia. The passage of $61 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine in April has largely been credited to the multi-pronged evangelical levers pulled to convince Speaker Johnson &#x2014; after reportedly getting approval from Trump himself &#x2014; to stop delaying its approval and swiftly adopt it. Days before the aid bill was adopted, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said in an opinion piece published in one of Washington&#x2019;s main newspapers that Ukraine&#x2019;s nearly one million evangelicals are the largest in Europe. In the piece, titled &#x201C;Ukraine&#x2019;s evangelicals need U.S. support,&#x201D; Yermak describes the &#x201C;long history&#x201D; of American-Ukrainian evangelical cooperation, calling on the two sides to come together to &#x201C;ensure religious tolerance in Ukraine.&#x201D; Appealing to evangelicals&apos; Christian values is as much about drumming up support for Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia as it is combatting Kremlin propaganda narratives that have permeated conservative political camps in the U.S. Even without propaganda, the view some Americans have of idolizing Russian values is enough to have to combat. Twenty-four percent of Republican primary voters believe Russia promotes and encourages traditional family values, according to polling done immediately following April&#x2019;s aid package. In Russia, however, religion, like politics, is heavily controlled, with the dominant Russian Orthodox Church serving Kremlin interests. Other faiths are suppressed or contained, including evangelicals. In contrast, religious freedom has typically thrived in Ukraine, where the Orthodox Christian faith is the largest but by no means dominant in a competitive and friendly environment where large portions of the population are also protestant or Catholic. They, along with religious leaders of Muslims and Jews, jointly condemn Russia&#x2019;s invasion and its war crimes. Russia has also used religion to justify its war against Ukraine as needed to &#x201C;de-Nazify&#x201D; the country even though Zelensky is of Jewish roots. Moore, who founded the Ukraine Freedom Project, says he&#x2019;s indirectly fighting a disinformation battle against far-right media star Tucker Carlson and conspiracy theorist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. &#x201C;Wow, these people are like me,&#x201D; American Christians respond when Moore shows them a video of Russian soldiers interrupting a Ukrainian church service, allowing his message to resonate with American churchgoers. Carlson and Greene, Moore says, are feeding Russian propaganda to the same Republicans he&#x2019;s reaching with his messaging of Ukrainian freedom. The conservative idols are partly responsible for the false claim popular among the right that Ukraine is &#x201C;persecuting Christians,&#x201D; allegedly due to the Ukrainian parliament&#x2019;s Aug. 20 potential banning on the Kremlin-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate and thus, further amplifying conservative opposition for sending U.S. aid to Ukraine. &#x201C;There is no similar country to evangelicals and Catholics than Ukraine, but there&#x2019;s that misinformation out there,&#x201D; Congressman Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I heard it back home, a lady said &#x2018;Why is Ukraine against Evangelicals?&#x201D; This is why Moore says he continuously shuttles between Kyiv and Washington, solely to compile Republican support for Ukraine. However, in an election teetering in the margin of error in polls, every vote counts, which is why the Democratic presidential campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris has an evangelical outreach strategy. One message Moore says gets through to Republicans is the story of Viktor Cherniivaski, a Ukrainian evangelical who says a Russian Orthodox priest watched Russian soldiers torture him. Another is Ukrainian religious freedom being threatened by the &#x201C;evil axis&#x201D; of Russia and its allies in its war against Ukraine which are seen as a threat to Western civilization at large: China, Iran, and North Korea. Putting the war into this context could trigger more conservative buy-in. &#xA0;When Moore says Russia is using the same Iranian drones against Ukraine that Tehran is using against Israel, he gains Republican&#x2019;s attention. Twelve days before the aid package passed on April 24, Speaker Johnson received a letter urging him to pass aid for Ukraine from the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. &#x201C;I am writing to share the concerns of our convention in continuing to support the people of Ukraine in their struggles to protect their national sovereignty,&#x201D; the letter read. &#x201C;We support the work of Congress in providing additional support to Ukraine and welcome Congress to take action to prevent further loss of life.&#x201D; Ryan Burge, a political scientist and Baptist minister, said the ERLC represents the elite side of a divide within American evangelicals. The ERLC&#x2019;s former president was joined by the Baptist Union of Ukraine in another letter to the speaker. &#x201C;We humbly ask you to consider the plight of Christians,&#x201D; the letter reads. When former President Trump first appeared at the Republican National Convention in July with his running mate JD Vance, an evangelical from Odesa, Ukraine, Pavlo Unguryan, was working the crowd of Republicans. To combat Russian propaganda that Unguryan says reaches Republicans, he knows it&#x2019;s not just about getting the message to Speaker Johnson. He spent the RNC telling fellow conservatives about the repeated history of Russia&#x2019;s targeted repression of religions inside Ukraine that fall outside of Russian Orthodoxy. Speaking to as many Republicans as possible at the RNC, Unguryan explained to conservatives that they can maintain their geopolitical, economic, and military concerns around the war while also supporting further U.S. aid to Ukraine because the war is &#x201C;spiritual.&#x201D; Russia wants to attack all Christian civilization in the West, Unguryan tells Republicans.

(Kirill Chubotin / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)The various efforts from Unguryan and others did not conclude with the April aid package. In June, Zelensky became the first head of state to attend the National Prayer Breakfast in Kyiv, a government-hosted event Unguryan brought to Ukraine and replicated off America&#x2019;s annual gathering by the same name where politicians and guests gather to pray. &#x201C;We pray for the continued strength of the Ukrainian forces, the safety of the Ukrainian people, and lasting peace in your homeland,&#x201D; Speaker Johnson said in his video address at Kyiv&#x2019;s prayer breakfast. Johnson&#x2019;s partial shift towards supporting Ukraine and its eventual passage signaled that the strategy was successful and worth continuing. That is why Unguryan plans to return to Washington in early December, just after the inauguration of the 47th president, regardless of who is elected. For Kyiv, this work wasn&#x2019;t just important for one aid package, or any current situation on the front line. American evangelicals are an important part of a long-term building block for the future support Ukraine will need from the U.S., said Jonathan Katz, a national security expert at the Brookings Institute. An evangelical of the vast Southern Baptist denomination from Louisiana, Johnson, who was largely seen as responsible for the stalling and eventual passing of the April aid package, has said he intends to retain speakership after the 2024 presidential election. &#x201C;Mike Johnson, he&#x2019;s not a part of the discourse, he&#x2019;s not a thought leader,&#x201D; Burge said after speaking with many evangelical leaders. &#x201C;I think they all understand that he is the least bad option.&#x201D; However, the Ukrainian faith leaders who&#x2019;ve gone to Washington and sent letters to the speaker have gotten through as Johnson has spoken more about the issue. On the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Washington, Johnson deviated into a passionate and personal tone, detailing his frustrations with Russia&#x2019;s killing of Christian Ukrainians, tying it back to American religious freedom. &#x201C;The communists always do this, they go after the Christians first,&#x201D; Johnson said. &#x201C;Why? Because they believe they owe an allegiance to a power higher than the government, than the state. And so you have to eliminate that&#x2026; And it&#x2019;s vicious and vile, and it shows exactly what Putin and his regime is all about.&#x201D; Despite spending years as a Republican staffer on the Hill and being raised evangelical, Moore was pleasantly surprised to hear these remarks from Johnson. Moore had just returned home from visiting the site of the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital attack in Kyiv when he listened to the speaker. People clear rubble from a building at one of the largest children&#x2019;s hospitals of Ukraine, &#x2018;Okhmatdyt&#x2019;, partially destroyed by a Russian missile strike on July 8, 2024 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;After seeing that and hearing Johnson say the things you want a leader to say on national security, that was really cool,&#x201D; Moore said. Although it&#x2019;s unclear how far Johnson will allow his evangelical connections to take him in supporting further aid to Ukraine, he isn&#x2019;t alone on principle. Razom for Ukraine, an advocacy group in Washington, has garnered support for Ukraine in crucial swing districts in the South and Midwest by engaging with evangelical communities and sharing insight into the loss Christian Ukrainians are experiencing. In March 2024, Daniel Balson of Razom took a team to Shreveport, Louisiana, Johnson&#x2019;s hometown. Balson brought Roman Rubchenko, a Ukrainian basketball player with him, who went on a local news program and delivered messages about Ukraine needing sustained support to the conservative state of Louisiana, where he used to play college basketball for a school widely revered in the state. &#x201C;The focus of Shreveport &#x2014; we wanted people there to see themselves in Ukraine, to see themselves as connected to the country,&#x201D; Balson said. Johnson&#x2019;s Shrevport-based team was in a listening capacity when they met with Razom, with the Republican&#x2019;s staffers open and wanting to learn. Less than two months later, Johnson allowed Ukraine to receive the $61 billion in aid. Razom for Ukraine is running billboards in Mike Johnson&#x2019;s home district in Shreveport, Louisiana, US to make sure he knows Ukraine&#x2019;s Baptists are counting on him. (Razom for Ukraine / X (Twitter))&#x201C;Mike Johnson is in some ways a weather vape,&#x201D; Matt Taylor, who studies the intersection of evangelicals and politics at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies said. &#x201C;He is a creature of the religious right, he tends to kind of try to triangulate and find the optimal position that will offend the least evangelicals while also trying to not get sideways with Trump.&#x201D; From Shreveport to Wisconsin, when Balson returns to Washington after engagement tours with multi-religious communities, lawmakers on the Hill want to know what he heard and saw in their districts. In these settings, photos &#x2014; shared with Balson by Moore in Kyiv &#x2014; of a Protestant&#x2019;s entire backside bruised from a beating delivered by Russian state security serve useful for Balson&#x2019;s message. And when Balson is in a district hostile toward Ukraine, he reminds voters that, like taxes, childcare, and housing, foreign policy is subject to political pressure, and thus their emotional response to religious freedom is enough to impact conversations in Washington. Speaker Johnson reminded Kyiv of this very matter in late September when &#x2014; amid exchanged hostilities between Trump and Zelensky &#x2014; he signed a letter recommending Zelensky fire his U.S. Ambassador for his visit to an arms manufacturer in a key swing state, Pennsylvania. Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, attended the visit. Republican politicians were not invited. However, given that Johnson already faced threats to oust him as speaker, efforts from the various organizations working in this space are focused on the entire Republican base. Moore, of Ukraine Freedom Project, said he would be disappointed to see Johnson lose the speakership, as he sees him as a good offset to Trump&#x2019;s running mate JD Vance, especially on Ukraine. When Sergeyev, the chaplain, testified in a small room on the Hill, the congressman who Sergeyev most needed his message to reach, Speaker Johnson, wasn&#x2019;t present. Elsewhere on the Hill, up in the Capitol&#x2019;s robust gallery during the fiery speech of Israel&#x2019;s Benjamin Netanyahu that day, two evangelicals sat together watching the procession. One of them was Speaker Johnson and the other, invited as his guest, was Gary Marx, a Republican strategist. After attending Kyiv&#x2019;s prayer breakfast in June, Marx took to the conservative-leaning Washington Times, writing, &#x201C;Patriarch Kiril of the Russian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate has called Russia&#x2019;s attack on Ukraine a &#x2018;holy war,&#x2019; which is synonymous with the Muslim concept of jihad. Ukrainian Christians simply want to live in a free society and worship God as they see fit, just like American evangelicals.&#x201D; Marx, who leads the organization Defenders of Faith and Religious Freedom in Ukraine, which is part of a $3.6 million effort from Kyiv Global Outreach, took the opportunity to remind conservative leaders in Washington of the religious persecution Russia has pursued in Ukraine. The long-held relationship between the speaker and Marx represents the larger, delicate, and often behind-the-scenes efforts to expand U.S. support for Ukraine through American evangelicals not letting up. &#x201C;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin suddenly embraced the evangelical community and allowed religious freedom, then we wouldn&apos;t really have a leg to stand on but I don&#x2019;t see that happening,&#x201D; Marx said. Unguryan, who was with Johnson on the April day it was decided the aid for Ukraine would pass, said Johnson&#x2019;s ascent to the speakership was just the next step in their time-tested friendship. Serhii Gadarzhi (L), who lost his wife and child in a Russian strike on Odesa, Ukraine, with Mike Johnson, U.S. House Speaker (C), and Pavlo Unguryan (R). (Odesa Regional Association of Baptist Churches /Facebook)Johnson was swayed to allow the aid to pass because evangelicals, like Unguryan, the former member of the Ukrainian parliament from Odesa, were in his ear with continual messages of Christian suffering in Ukraine, according to Marx. It was the combination of sharing anecdotal stories and photographs of Ukrainian Christians suffering hardship at the hands of Russians combined with intelligence briefings Johnson received that convinced him to pass the aid, he added. &#x201C;When you put the personal along with the professional intelligence briefings together, the case is persuasive,&#x201D; Marx said. &#x201C;I think that that&apos;s what made the difference for Speaker Johnson.&#x201D; Unguryan said he routinely shows Johnson the &#x201C;real picture&#x201D; from Ukraine any chance he can, from occupied and burned churches to explaining the &#x2018;holy war&#x2019; he says Russia is carrying out similar to the Islamic State&#x2019;s attacks on Western civilized based on Judeo-Christian values. Months before the U.S. State Department said the Russian state-run media outlet RT was using Kremlin intelligence to spread propaganda, Unguryan was working to counter what he says are false images created by Russian agents by taking his message of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and the West at-large straight to Capitol Hill. &#x201C;Russia, as a totalitarian criminal country, wants to have an image of a conservative Christian nation but that&#x2019;s not the truth, and I try to communicate that with Mike Johnson,&#x201D; Unguryan said.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-road-to-republican-us-support-of-ukraine-continues-through-evangelicalism/	2024-10-14T13:42:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1191555698.jpg
Russia plans to involve North Korea in war in Ukraine this fall, Zelensky says	Russia plans to involve North Korea directly in the full-scale war against Ukraine this fall and winter, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 14, citing intelligence data. The announcement comes a day after Zelensky warned of an &quot;increasing alliance&quot; between Moscow and Pyongyang. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, Russia&apos;s plans for the fall and winter include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war,&quot; Zelensky said. The briefing also included updates on &quot;Russia&apos;s relations with some other countries, that, unfortunately, are investing in prolonging the war,&quot; the president added. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since fall of 2023. Earlier this year, two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-involve-north-korea-in-war-in-ukraine-this-fall-zelensky-says/	2024-10-14T12:42:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-2.jpeg
Putin submits treaty on strategic partnership with North Korea to parliament	Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a bill to the State Duma, published online on Oct. 14, to ratify a treaty entailing strategic partnership with North Korea. Among the tenets of the treaty is a stipulation that either country must provide military assistance to the other in the case of an attack. The treaty was first signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2024. The defense pact officially enters into effect when both nations ratify the agreement. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. In recent weeks, claims of a more direct North Korean presence in Ukraine have increased. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 13 warned of Russia&apos;s &quot;increasing alliance&quot; with North Korea, saying the partnership had moved beyond an arms deal and is now &quot;actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement followed reports that several North Korean officers had been killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in occupied Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers in early October that North Korea was likely planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed these reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; The agreement signed by Putin and Kim bears similarities to historical treaties. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency noted in June that Article 4 of the treaty, which discusses the obligation to render military assistance, replicates wording from Article 1 of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed by North Korea and the Soviet Union in 1961.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-submits-treaty-on-strategic-partnership-with-north-korea-to-parliament/	2024-10-14T12:32:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2157616618.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian Tu-134 transport aircraft set ablaze over 1,000 km from Ukraine, military intelligence claims	Key developments on Oct. 14: A Russian Tu-134 military transport aircraft was set on fire at a military airfield in Orenburg Oblast overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. &quot;Such Soviet aircraft are used, in particular, to transport the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; HUR said. According to the agency, the plane, which belonged to the 117th Military Transport Aviation Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces, burned to the ground at the Orenburg-2 military airfield. The airfield is located 6 kilometers (3 miles) southwest of the Russian city of Orenburg. The city lies roughly 1,250 kilometers (780 miles) from the front line in Ukraine and 90 kilometers (60 miles) north of the Russia-Kazakhstan border. HUR shared footage of the fire without claiming responsibility for the incident. &quot;Every crime against the Ukrainian people will be duly punished,&quot; the agency added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report. The Tupolev Tu-134 is a twin-engined airliner produced in the Soviet Union from 1966-89. Following the crash of a Tu-134 in 2011, which killed 47 people, it was fully withdrawn from commercial service in 2019. VIP private jet versions are still available to buy in Russia, with one currently listed online at $2.5 million. Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast amid ongoing hostilities in the sector. The statement came after Kyiv&apos;s warnings of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to reports, Russian troops renewed attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector in recent days. Vladyslav Voloshyn, the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson, refuted in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that Russia had launched a major offensive in the sector, saying that Russia is only carrying out local ground assaults. When asked about the alleged seizure of Levadne, Voloshyn said that the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically&quot; and that each side can regain the initiative. Levadne is located west of the village of Velyka Novosilka, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. In recent weeks, Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne close to Levadne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers. On Oct. 5, Voloshyn said that Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Some 112,337 residents of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast left their homes due to hostilities, Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova said in an interview published on Oct. 14, citing the country&apos;s Emergency Ministry. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, authorities in Russian border regions have often reported Ukrainian strikes as the hostilities spilled across the border. The evacuation efforts intensified after Kyiv&apos;s cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Speaking to the Kremlin-controlled outlet Argumenty i Fakty, Moskalkova said that this number includes 12,328 people placed at temporary facilities across Russia and around 100,000 living with relatives and friends. Around 40,000 people refused to evacuate or had already returned to their residences, the official added. Overall, 30,415 residents of Belgorod and Kursk regions and other territories near the Russia-Ukraine border were placed at 960 temporary accommodation facilities across Russia, Moskalkova claimed. This number includes 7,670 children, she added. The official alleged this figure encompasses residents who &quot;fled&quot; Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts two years ago &quot;due to shelling.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Moskalkova&apos;s claims as Russia has carried out forced deportations of Ukrainian residents of occupied territories, including children. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. Kyiv said it would adhere to international humanitarian law in its conduct toward Russian civilians in Kursk Oblast, inviting the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts.&quot; The Kremlin has dismissed the move as &quot;provocation.&quot; Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade crossed into Kursk Oblast two days before Kyiv launched its operation in the Russian region, aiding the subsequent offensive, Pavlo Rozlach, the brigade&apos;s commander, said in an interview with the TSN news program aired on Oct. 13. According to Rozlach, one Ukrainian company sneaked into Kursk Oblast in groups of six soldiers and hid in the forest. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces helped them to cross the border. When the operation began, the company attacked a Russian stronghold near the border. The successful operation paved the way for the entry of Ukrainian vehicles, the commander said. Ukraine also disrupted Russia&apos;s communication system, which disoriented Russian forces, he added. &quot;There were certain risks. If the enemy had found this company, the element of surprise would have been lost,&quot; Rozlach said. Afterward, two battalions reportedly broke through minefields thanks to engineers and kept on advancing in Kursk Oblast. Following recent attacks by Russian forces against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian soldiers are holding the line despite Russian attempts to break through. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10. A Russian attack on Kherson Oblast using a first-person view (FPV) drone on Oct. 14 killed two women in their car, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry said. Ukraine liberated the southern city of Kherson from Russian occupation in November 2022. Since then, Russian troops have regularly attacked the city and nearby areas along the western bank of the Dnipro River. In recent weeks, residents of Kherson have reported an increase in indiscriminate Russian attacks using FPV drones on civilian targets in the city and other parts of the oblast, referring to the apparently new strategy as a &quot;human safari.&quot; The most recent incident occurred near the town of Beryslav, located some 75 kilometers east of the city of Kherson, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. A civilian vehicle with five people inside was targeted with an FPV drone, killing two women aged 72 and 56, as well as injuring a 72-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman. The driver of the vehicle was unharmed, the Interior Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-tu-134-transport-aircraft-set-ablaze-over-1-000-km-from-ukraine-military-intelligence-claims-2/	2024-10-14T11:18:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-14-083810.png
Russia’s milbloggers celebrate executions of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk region	Russian pro-war milbloggers have reacted to yet more reports of Ukrainian POWs being executed by Moscow&#x2019;s forces by seeking to justify the killings, while some have even called for more. In the latest case of what appears to be an increasingly common occurrence, Russian troops reportedly shot dead nine Ukrainian drone operators who surrendered near the village of Zeleny Shlyakh in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast on Oct. 10. In a counterattack to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion launched two and a half years ago, Ukraine&#x2019;s army more than two months ago conducted an incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, and has controlled a patch of the territory ever since. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation into the killings, describing them as &#x201C;a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime.&#x201D; Several prominent milbloggers did not deny the reports but instead argued that the killing of POWs was justified. Several even reveled in the alleged murders. Many Russian milbloggers have a significant following in Russian society, with some having hundreds of thousands of subscribers on Telegram, and others having more than a million. An independent political analyst currently based in Russia told the Kyiv Independent that milbloggers represent a militant and radical minority rather than the majority of the public, but stressed they &#x201C;would be unlikely to function&#x201D; without the blessing of the Kremlin. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to the fear of reprisals.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;Their Telegram channels have many subscribers, which means that part of society trusts them as sources of information,&quot; he said. &quot;Overall, society is definitely not bloodthirsty and, of course, does not support any executions; only aggressive ultranationalists might support such things.&quot; Russian public support for the war in Ukraine has been strong throughout the full-scale invasion, though some recent polls suggest this is declining. Kremlin authorities have not publicly commented on the report and did not respond to requests for comment. The milbloggers who supported the alleged killing have mostly backed the Kremlin&apos;s policy but sometimes criticized the conduct of the war, arguing that Russia&apos;s approach is not hardline enough. One known as Starshe Eddy (Older than the Edda) with 628,000 followers said the executions were &quot;good but not enough.&quot; &quot;During World War II, there were entire units of the German army that were not taken prisoner,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In our case, the scum who entered Kursk Oblast and were shooting peaceful civilians got what they deserved.&quot; There is no evidence to support this claim. Another known as Rosgvardeyets (Russian Guard member) with 29,000 followers, wrote that &quot;they should have been executed&quot; even if they had surrendered as prisoners of war without fighting. &quot;Drone operators should not be allowed to live,&quot; he wrote. &quot;First extract all the information from them, and then dispose of them... The nature of war has changed. &#x201C;In the past, snipers and pilots weren&apos;t taken prisoner, and now drone operators have been added to the list.&quot; Zapiski veterana (A veteran&#x2019;s notes) with 358,000 followers, accused Ukrainian drone operators of &quot;hunting civilians during the evacuation from Sudzha (in Kursk Oblast) and the Sudzha district.&quot; &quot;These bastards got a fairly humane death,&quot; the blogger wrote. There is no evidence to suggest Ukrainian drone operators hunt civilians in Kursk Oblast or anywhere else on the battlefield. There is, however, extensive and well&#x2013;documented targeting of civilians by Russian drone operators, particularly in Kherson Oblast. The blogger known as Dva Maiora (Two Majors) with 1.18 million followers, justified the killings by saying that the prisoners surrendered only after initially fighting back. &quot;Even the enemy channels write that they didn&#x2019;t try to surrender immediately,&quot; Dva Maiora said. &quot;They fought... These bastards thought that 20 kilometers from the front line, they could continue killing civilians with impunity.&quot; There is no evidence to support Dva Maiora&#x2019;s claims of the drone operators killing civilians. Rybar, one of the best-known milboggers with a following of 1.3 million, attempted to downplay the alleged crime. &quot;Such executions on the front line from both sides of the conflict are far from uncommon,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the most common scenarios is an attempt to escape and seize a weapon, leading to the liquidation of the captives as part of armed combat.&quot; Rybar also said that &quot;captives often become a burden: there is not always an opportunity to assign even a guard to them when you are conducting effective assault operations.&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s easy to fight from high offices and demand humanity, as long as you&#x2019;re not on the front lines and facing a &#x2018;them or us&#x2019; situation,&quot; he said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiga posted on X on Oct 13, calling for the international community to take immediate action by issuing warrants for Russian soldiers found to have executed POWs, increasing sanctions, and demanding access to detention sites. Russia&apos;s mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war is absolute barbarism, grave violation of international humanitarian law, laws and customs of war. Executions are becoming more frequent, 95% of POWs are subjected to torture according to the UN, denied basic needs and access. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about the alleged killing to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-milbloggers-celebrate-executions-of-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-region/	2024-10-14T10:55:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157902239.jpg
Russia could attack NATO by 2030, German intelligence chief says	Russia will have the military capabilities to be able to attack NATO by 2030, said German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl during a parliamentary hearing on Oct. 14. Kahl&apos;s comments were the latest in a series of increasingly dire warnings from Western leaders and defense officials about the threat emanating from Russia and Europe&apos;s current lack of preparedness. Russia&apos;s determination to use covert and hybrid measures against the West has reached a &quot;level previously unseen,&quot; Kahl said, adding that they are being used &quot;without any scruples.&quot; Moscow&apos;s ultimate goals are to &quot;push the U.S. out of Europe,&quot; roll back NATO boundaries to the 1990s, and create a &quot;Russian sphere of influence&quot; with the aim of cementing a &quot;new world order.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;will continue to test the West&apos;s red lines and further escalate the confrontation,&quot; Kahl said, warning that Russia&apos;s military spending is far outstripping that of the West. Separately, Thomas Haldewang, the chief of Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence agency, said that Russian espionage and sabotage activity in Europe has sharply increased.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-attack-nato-by-2030-german-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-10-14T09:24:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162022838.jpg
New customs reform aims to tackle Ukraine’s ‘single biggest cash cow’ of corrupt money in politics	At a time when state coffers are starving for money to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, illegal smuggling is costing the country billions of dollars a year in lost tax payments. Through bribery or lying, smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year as they smuggle everything from cigarettes and iPhones to perfume and food across the border undeclared or mislabeled. Last year, the State Customs Service audited 9,000 cases of declared &#x201C;humanitarian aid&#x201D; entering the country and found that around a third were probably other goods falsely labeled to avoid customs fees. Customs postings can be so lucrative that criminals are willing to shell out large sums for desirable positions: Ukraine&#x2019;s anti-corruption bureau uncovered an attempt earlier this year to bribe officials with $1.7 million into appointing three regional heads of customs who would turn a blind eye to illegal schemes. &#x201C;Customs is perhaps the single biggest cash cow that brings corrupt money into Ukraine&apos;s political system. It&#x2019;s the largest tax-evasion scheme in the country,&#x201D; said Josh Rudolph, a senior fellow and head of the transatlantic democracy working group of the U.S.-based think tank German Marshall Fund. &#xA0; The problem is so severe that Ukrainians view the State Customs Service as the most corrupt institution in the government. Trucks are pictured at the Krakovets-Korczowa checkpoint at the Ukraine-Poland border that was upgraded under the Open Border project, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on June 20, 2022. (Alona Nikolaievych/Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)With mounting internal and external pressure on Ukraine to reign in corruption at the border, parliament has passed an extensive new reform bill to overhaul the State Customs Service. After previous failed attempts at reform, increased pressure from Western partners during the war has lent political heft to overhauling the institution. The bill was submitted to the president on Sept. 23 and will take effect after he signs it into law, though its effects of reforms may take years to show up in the state&#x2019;s budget, which is desperate for cash as Russia&#x2019;s war enters its third year. &#xA0; Corruption in customs &#x201C;is a big challenge that requires sweeping reform, and this (bill) is a good starting place,&#x201D; Rudolph said. The most significant change in the bill requires two candidates for the new head of the State Customs Service to be selected by an independent commission, where half the commission&apos;s members are independent foreign experts. This style of selection process &#x2014; which cuts the potential for corrupt influence on choosing appointees &#x2014; is modeled after successful anti-corruption efforts to select heads of other Ukrainian agencies. &#x201C;You need not just the right people, but you also need them to know that they can make good decisions,&#x201D; said Olena Scherban, deputy executive director of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC). &#x201C;In some cases, the (Customs Service&#x2019;s) rules should be changed, but that can only happen when the head of customs won&#x2019;t be politically dependent on people for the appointment.&#x201D; &#x201C;When the head can&#x2019;t be suddenly dismissed and won&#x2019;t be dependent on the decisions of the Finance Ministry and cabinet of ministers,&#x201D; Scherban said, &#x201C;this is when (the head) will understand that they have an opportunity to be independent, and to rein in illegal cash flow from customs and to bring additional money to the state budget.&#x201D; A previous attempt at reforming the Customs Service stalled in 2020, after the then-head of the service Max Nefyodov was dismissed from his post.

(Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Nefyodov, who had a reputation as an effective anti-corruption reformer and implemented strong transparency policies in his previous post as a deputy economy minister, accused the government of bowing to pressure from powerful smugglers demanding his ousting. The government said that he failed to meet revenue targets. The bill also gives the new head increased independence in choosing deputies, reduces the influence of the finance minister, provides for independent audits carried out by international experts, and requires a one-time recertification process to vet all current department employees. The vetting will look at the integrity of approximately 9,700 current employees and examine the legality of their finances and sources of income. It is expected to take years to complete. &#xA0; &#x201C;You have this saying in the United States that &#x2018;personnel is policy,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Rudolph of the German Marshall Fund. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be a long, challenging process, but I would not underestimate bringing in genuinely new blood and enabling the removal of anyone who&#x2019;s not going to be contributing meaningfully to reform.&#x201D; The economic realities of Russia&#x2019;s invasion heightened the urgency of this major overhaul and made it possible, said the main author of the reform bill, Yaroslav Zhelezniak, lawmaker and first deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. &#x201C;We need resources to fund our war from taxes and customs. If something is broken, you have to fix it,&#x201D; Zhelezniak told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Not everyone in the government supported it, to be honest,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but due to strong support from the speaker of parliament and the head of the coalition and prime minister, we pushed it through parliament.&#x201D; The bill also received a significant boost after foreign partners included it in required reforms linked to foreign aid. Customs reform is one of the necessary steps Ukraine needs to tackle by the end of this month, in order to meet IMF benchmarks to secure the next round of the IMF&#x2019;s $15 billion loan package. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a first deputy head of the Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. (Yaroslav Zhelezniak/ Facebook)Passing the final version of the bill &#x201C;became possible because the IMF, World Bank, and the U.S. included it in their obligations,&#x201D; Zhelezniak noted. &#x201C;The statistic for all obligations connected with receiving money is very simple: 100% of them have been approved. So, there is zero chance for failure when there is a financial obligation.&#x201D; The reforms are also necessary for Ukraine to enter the EU, a key goal of Ukraine as it seeks to strengthen ties with the West. Ukraine submitted its official membership bid in February 2022. &#x201C;Customs in the EU is the cornerstone of the Single Market, which is the key component of European integration,&#x201D; said Igor Dankov, the customs counselor for the Foreign Ministry&#x2019;s Mission of Ukraine to the European Union. &#x201C;EU customs administrations act as one, and Ukraine&apos;s Customs should belong to the EU Customs family. Customs need to strengthen its security functions and be prepared to operate at external borders of the EU. That is why we need reform.&#x201D; Major business associations had also championed this bill, pressuring the government to raise revenue from illegal markets after the government moved to raise taxes on legal businesses. With Ukraine facing a $35 billion budget deficit next year, customs reform was an attempt to mitigate the unpopularity of the country&#x2019;s first wartime tax hike. &#xA0; &#x201C;I would say that this situation with the budget was one of the political enablers for this reform to actually be voted on. Because there is huge pressure from people and from businesses to actually not only raise tax rates but to work on more even tax compliance and on leveling the field,&#x201D; Yurii Gaidai, senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy (CES), told the Kyiv Independent last month. &#x201C;The big business pushback helped put these new (custom) reforms into play,&#x201D; he said. &#xA0; Customs reform has long been a goal of Ukraine&#x2019;s business community. Before the full-scale invasion, a 2019 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine (AmCham) found that 76% of its members believed customs reform should be the top priority for Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament and government. The majority named anti-corruption efforts as the reason. The chamber surveyed hundreds of its members engaging in international trade, which include many of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest employers. &#x201C;The effective operation of customs facilitates trade simplification, reduces costs and delays at the border, and enhances competitiveness and the overall business climate,&#x201D; Vita Miroshnychenko, head of customs and international trade of PwC Ukraine and a co-chair of AmCham, told the Kyiv Independent. During wartime, effective customs work also smooths the transit of humanitarian aid and defense goods, she added. After the president signs the law, it will take time to see results. &#xA0;The law provides two months for a selection committee to be formed, and up to three years for the re-certifications to be carried out. &#x201C;Even if it goes as fast and well as possible, I would not expect to have any fiscal results in the coming budget year,&#x201D; said Gaidai from CES. &#x201C;I would even say that if it&#x2019;s really done properly, we could expect some decrease in tax revenues at first,&#x201D; Gaidai said. &#x201C;Because every time the previous government strived to reform the customs service, they faced sabotage from corrupt people there.&#x201D; Sabotage or undue influence is possible again, said AntAC&#x2019;s Scherban, but there is also a simpler challenge &#x2014; finding quality talent in a war-ravaged populace. Among other similarly structured competitions for high-ranking government officials, &#x201C;we see a lack of real candidates who trust the reforms and want to apply, because of the war. Many talented professional people go to the Armed Forces,&#x201D; said Scherban. &#x201C;The most key, important thing is a successful selection process for the new head of the Customs Service. &#xA0;All the procedures, the recertification, and so on, depend on the head. &#xA0;So, we will monitor the process very closely,&#x201D; said Scherban.

(Pavlo Palamarchuk/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The signing of the law can still be a powerful signal that change is coming, forcing employees to adjust their expectations and behavior, Zhelezniak noted, citing the experience of similar reforms to other Ukrainian institutions. But it is still only one step of many, Zhelezniak said, adding that he plans to continue working on future reforms that will digitize the agency, reduce opportunities for human interference, bring the agency closer in line with EU customs requirements, and secure the budget to raise salaries and attract better talent. &#x201C;Customs is not technocratic reform,&#x201D; Zhelezniak said. &#x201C;It&apos;s not where you implement one process or one new department and you solve the problem. There are thousands of people on the border who every day, every hour, have to do their job. There is no way to decrease corruption or make it disappear without changing the minds and approaches of these people.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/new-customs-reform-aims-to-tackle-ukraines-single-biggest-cash-cow-of-political-corruption/	2024-10-14T09:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242568981.jpg
Russia sentences French national to 3 years in prison over alleged foreign agents violation	A Moscow court sentenced on Oct. 14 French national Laurent Vinatier to three years and three months in prison over allegedly violating Russia&apos;s &quot;foreign agents&quot; legislation. Vinatier, who holds a PhD and works for the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), was arrested while visiting Russia in June for reportedly failing to register as a foreign agent. The &quot;foreign agents&quot; designation requires people and entities who allegedly receive &quot;support&quot; from abroad to place a disclaimer in all of their publishing and mandates strict financial reporting. It is broadly seen as a means to repress domestic opposition. Russian investigators claimed that beyond the violation of the foreign agents registration, Vinatier had plead guilty to illegally obtaining information about the military. There is no way to independently verify the validity of Vinatier&apos;s alleged confession. Russia does not provide transparent access to its legal system, and international human rights organizations have long detailed rampant abuse in prisons, as well as the use of torture to coerce confessions. Russia has routinely arrested foreign nationals, a number of whom were released in a high-profile prisoner exchange in August. Moscow has been accused of detaining foreigners on trumped-up charges and holding them as hostages to leverage the release of Russian nationals held in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sentences-french-national-to-3-years-in-prison-over-alleged-foreign-agents-violation/	2024-10-14T07:49:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177655148.jpg
North Korean soldiers are reportedly in Ukraine — here's what we know	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 13 warned of Russia&apos;s &quot;increasing alliance&quot; with North Korea, stressing it had moved beyond the supply of just weaponry and was now &quot;actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement came days after reports that several North Korean officers had been killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in occupied Ukraine, raising speculation about just how involved Pyongyang currently is in Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,&quot; said Zelensky, who has previously pointed to Russia&#x2019;s deepening role within an axis of rogue regimes, including Iran, who are allied against Ukraine and its Western allies. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Very little aside from the stated intentions from Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic defense agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang on June 19. As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineer unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead, and it is not known if the six North Korean officers reportedly killed were part of this unit. On Oct. 4, Russian milbloggers reported that North Korean military personnel were visiting the front lines as part of an &quot;exchange of experience&quot; program and were being shown how Moscow&apos;s forces prepared defensive positions and assault operation techniques. In a press briefing on June 25, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said North Korean troops would become &quot;cannon fodder&quot; if they joined Russian forces on the battlefield in Ukraine. The reports of six North Korean officers killed in Ukraine have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source, though South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun said earlier this month it was likely true. Zelensky provided no further evidence on Oct. 13, and the Kyiv Independent has been unable to verify the reports. The Guardian reported on Oct. 10, citing an unnamed source in Ukraine, that there are &quot;dozens of North Koreans behind Russian lines&quot; to assist with the launching of Pyongyang-supplied Kn-23 ballistic missiles. Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, told AFP the deployment of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine could be viewed from Pyongyang as an opportunity for its military to learn &quot;how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience.&quot; &quot;This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers &#x2014; to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.&quot; North Korean soldiers waving their national flags as they welcome Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after he landed at the airport in Pyongyang, North Korea on Oct. 18, 2023. (Kim Won Jin / AFP via Getty Images)Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; A Washington Post (WP) article on Oct. 11 cited a Ukrainian military intelligence official as saying &quot;several thousand&quot; North Korean troops were undergoing training in Russia and could be deployed to Ukraine by the end of the year. It added that North Korean officers were already on the ground in Ukraine in observation roles, but no units of troops had been reported as of yet. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on Oct. 11 said the deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine could free up Russian forces to concentrate on priority areas on the front lines. But it also added that if they are of poor quality, North Korean troops &quot;could also create opportunities for Ukrainian exploitation.&quot; There have also been reports of North Korean military or police personnel traveling to join &quot;reconstruction efforts&quot; in occupied Donbas in early 2023. Regardless of whether or not North Korean troops are physically in Ukraine, there is plenty of other evidence to demonstrate the ever-deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang. Isolated on the world stage after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and with ammunition stocks running low after more than two-and-a-half years of war, Russia has become increasingly dependent on North Korean-supplied weaponry. The relationship was solidified in late June, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang, where he signed the partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, pledging to provide aid to one another if either was attacked. In August, South Korea&#x2019;s Yonhap news agency reported North Korea had sent containers presumably to Russia that could contain more than 6 million artillery shells. In exchange for the ammunition, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft.

(Contributor/Getty Images)The Times reported earlier this month that half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea. Though a large number of the shells are believed to be faulty, the sheer number being shipped to Moscow&apos;s forces are believed to have played a crucial role in Russia&apos;s grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, most recently the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast earlier this month. Shin Won-sik, South Korean defense minister, said in June that Pyongyang also sent dozens of ballistic missiles that Moscow&apos;s troops fire at Ukraine. But their reliability has also been questioned. &#xA0;Around half of the North Korean missiles fired at Ukraine by Russia have malfunctioned and exploded in mid-air, Reuters reported on May 7, citing Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-are-reportedly-in-ukraine-heres-what-we-know/	2024-10-14T06:49:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157690883.jpg
Russian drone attack on Kherson Oblast kills 2	A Russian attack on Kherson Oblast using a first-person view (FPV) drone on Oct. 14 killed two women in their car, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry said. Ukraine liberated the southern city of Kherson from Russian occupation in November 2022. Since then, Russian troops have regularly attacked the city and nearby areas along the western bank of the Dnipro River. In recent weeks, residents of Kherson have reported an increase in indiscriminate Russian attacks using FPV drones on civilian targets in the city and other parts of the oblast, referring to the apparently new strategy as a &quot;human safari.&quot; The most recent incident occurred near the town of Beryslav, located some 75 kilometers east of the city of Kherson, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. A civilian vehicle with five people inside was targeted with an FPV drone, killing two women aged 72 and 56, as well as injuring a 72-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman. The driver of the vehicle was unharmed, the Interior Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-kherson-oblast-kills-2/	2024-10-14T06:32:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GZ2gSK7WMAsQ7Hn.jpeg
First Ukrainian troops crossed into Kursk Oblast 2 days before incursion, commander says	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade crossed into Kursk Oblast two days before Kyiv launched its operation in the Russian region, aiding the subsequent offensive, Pavlo Rozlach, the brigade&apos;s commander, said in an interview with TSN news program aired on Oct. 13. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. According to Rozlach, one Ukrainian company sneaked into Kursk Oblast in groups of six soldiers and hid in the forest. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces helped them to cross the border. When the operation began, the company attacked a Russian stronghold near the border. The successful operation paved the way for the entry of Ukrainian vehicles, the commander said. Ukraine also disrupted Russia&apos;s communication system, which disoriented Russian forces, he added. &quot;There were certain risks. If the enemy had found this company, the element of surprise would have been lost,&quot; Rozlach said. Afterward, two battalions reportedly broke through minefields thanks to engineers and kept on advancing in Kursk Oblast. Following recent attacks by Russian forces against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian soldiers are holding the line despite Russian attempts to break through. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/80-brigade-kursk/	2024-10-14T06:04:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
70% of Russian oil shipped by shadow fleet, posing environment risk, report says	Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers transports 70% of the country&apos;s seaborne oil exports, according to an analysis published by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute on Oct. 14. The report&apos;s conclusions underscore how Moscow is successfully evading the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil revenues through the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. The G7 unveiled the cap in late 2022 in an effort to undermine Russian fossil fuel profits, which feed Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, while minimizing impacts on the global oil market. To circumvent this restriction, Russia has invested $10 billion in expanding its shadow fleet since 2022, the KSE Institute&apos;s report said. In the first half of 2024, almost 75% of Russian seaborne oil was reportedly shipped through northern European waters&#x2014;including the Danish Straits and the English Channel&#x2014;with roughly 60% of that carried by shadow tankers that are, on average, 18 years old. The Ukraine-based think tank underscored the environmental risks posed by the shadow tankers, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Bloomberg reported in September that tankers also often reject the services of experienced Danish pilots when navigating the country&apos;s dangerous shipping straits, further increasing the risks. The KSE Institute called for a coordinated approach to tackle Russia&apos;s shadow fleet to &quot;protect the environment and ensure overall maritime safety in coalition waters.&quot; The report proposed several concrete steps, including mandatory insurance disclosure for vessels in the price cap coalition&apos;s waters. The coalition should also work with the &quot;flag states&quot; &#x2014; the nations under whose flags the vessels choose to sail &#x2014; through diplomatic channels and commercial incentives to ensure their compliance with international regulations. Tankers that do not adhere to these regulations should be sanctioned, and &quot;coalition countries should have the authority to stop vessels posing immediate environmental or safety risks,&quot; the KSE Institute recommended. The U.S., the EU, and other Western partners have been imposing additional sanctions against tankers and companies evading the price cap since late 2023. The think tank noted that sanctions imposed against the shadow fleet have not impacted global oil prices and that Russia is unlikely to cut production. This means that the proposed steps would cause only minimal disruptions to global markets, the report concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/shadow-fleet-environment/	2024-10-14T05:50:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1822474446.jpeg
Kyiv rebukes Jared Leto over controversial remarks on Russia, war	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry criticized Jared Leto, a U.S. actor and Thirty Seconds To Mars frontman, for his remarks made at a concert in Belgrade on Oct. 11. During his performance, Leto asked the audience if there were many Russians among them, which was met with screams of joy. The musician subsequently said that he missed Russia and would visit once &quot;all these problems are finished,&quot; referring to Moscow&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;re going to come back to Serbia, we&apos;re going to go up to St. Petersburg over Moscow. We&apos;re going to drop down to Kyiv. We&#x2019;re gonna party and hang out with everybody,&quot; the singer said. After the footage of Leto&apos;s remarks went viral, he faced backlash from Ukrainians on social media. The Foreign Ministry said that Leto&apos;s &quot;feeling the Russian energy&quot; and his wish to perform in Russia &quot;is an insult to those sacrificing lives to defend freedom.&quot; &quot;There can be no appeasement for Russia when it continues its attempts to solve the &apos;problem&apos; of Ukraine&apos;s very existence,&quot; the ministry added. Leto and his team did not respond to the criticism. The musician had been performing in Ukraine and Russia before February 2022. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, he voiced his support for Ukraine. In 2013, Leto supported the Revolution of Dignity and later visited Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv, where protests took place to pay tribute to the &quot;Heavenly Hundred,&quot; the activists killed during the revolution. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-slams-jared-leto/	2024-10-14T05:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171095555.jpg
EU sanctions Iran over missile shipments to Russia	The EU on Oct. 14 adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Brussels joins the U.S. and other Western powers that have slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow. The EU&apos;s sanctions list newly includes individuals and entities responsible for the development and transfer of drones and missiles for use by Russia. &quot;The Iranian regime&apos;s support to Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine is unacceptable and must stop,&quot; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. &quot;I therefore welcome the adoption of our sanctions against individuals and entities in response to Iran&apos;s drone and missile transfers to Russia.&quot; The listings include three Iranian airlines &#x2013; Saha Airlines, Mahan Air, and Iran Air &#x2013; as well as two procurement companies and two producers of propellant used to launch the missiles. The Council of the EU also sanctioned Iranian Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari and top officials of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, including its Aerospace Force Space Division. Restrictive measures were further imposed against managing directors of the EU-listed companies Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries (HESA) and Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO). Moscow and Tehran have deepened military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Iran supplying Russia with Shahed attack drones and missiles. After meeting Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said that the two countries &quot;are actively working together in the international arena&quot; and their &quot;assessments of events taking place in the world are often very close.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-sanctions-iran/	2024-10-14T04:28:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1230595884.jpg
Russian strike on Odesa port kills 1, injures 8, damages civilian vessels	Russia attacked the southern city of Odesa&apos;s port infrastructure with a ballistic missile on Oct. 14, killing one person and injuring eight others, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. The attack damaged two civilian vessels &#x2014; NS Moon flying the flag of Belize and the Palau-flagged Optima, Kiper said. Russia targeted the latter ship last week on Oct. 7. In recent days, Russia stepped up its attacks against port infrastructure in Odesa Oblast, damaging several civilian ships. &quot;The purpose of these attacks is to reduce our export potential,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. &quot;This is a deliberate provocation of a food crisis in those parts of the world that are directly dependent on Ukrainian grain supplies.&quot; A grain warehouse, cargo cranes, and machinery were also damaged in the missile attack on Odesa, according to Kuleba. The victims are Ukrainians, employees of the port infrastructure. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 such attacks, damaging and destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, Kuleba said on Oct. 10. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes. Traveling along the route, Ukrainian ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. Kyiv was forced to set up a new export route in the Black Sea last year after Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-odesa/	2024-10-14T04:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
Russia claims capture of Zaporizhzhia Oblast village, Kyiv says 'situation dynamic'	Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast amid ongoing hostilities in the sector. The statement came after Kyiv&apos;s warnings of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to reports, Russian troops renewed attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector in recent days. Vladyslav Voloshyn, the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson, refuted in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that Russia had launched a major offensive in the sector, saying that Russia is only carrying out local ground assaults. When asked about the alleged seizure of Levadne, Voloshyn said that the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically&quot; and that each side can regain the initiative.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Levadne is located west of the village of Velyka Novosilka, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0; In recent weeks, Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne close to Levadne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers. On Oct. 5, Voloshyn said that Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/levadne/	2024-10-14T03:54:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1733436357.webp
Over 110,000 residents of Kursk Oblast evacuated, Russia's chief ombudsman claims	Some 112,337 residents of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast left their homes due to hostilities, Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova said in an interview published on Oct. 14, citing the country&apos;s Emergency Ministry. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, authorities in Russian border regions have often reported Ukrainian strikes as the hostilities spilled across the border. The evacuation efforts intensified after Kyiv&apos;s cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Speaking to the Kremlin-controlled outlet Argumenty i Fakty, Moskalkova said that this number includes 12,328 people placed at temporary facilities across Russia and around 100,000 living with relatives and friends. Around 40,000 people refused to evacuate or had already returned to their residences, the official added. Overall, 30,415 residents of Belgorod and Kursk regions and other territories near the Russia-Ukraine border were placed at 960 temporary accommodation facilities across Russia, Moskalkova claimed. This number includes 7,670 children, she added. The official alleged this figure encompasses residents who &quot;fled&quot; Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts two years ago &quot;due to shelling.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Moskalkova&apos;s claims as Russia has carried out forced deportations of Ukrainian residents of occupied territories, including children. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. Kyiv said it would adhere to international humanitarian law in its conduct toward Russian civilians in Kursk Oblast, inviting the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts.&quot; The Kremlin has dismissed the move as &quot;provocation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kursk-oblast-evacuations/	2024-10-14T03:33:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Ukraine's victory plan includes more Storm Shadow, ATACMS missiles, presidential advisor says	Ukraine&apos;s victory plan includes a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles and a permission to launch then against military targets in Russia, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in comments published on Oct. 14. President Volodymyr Zelensky pitched the five-step plan, which was presented as a way to just and lasting peace in Ukraine, to leaders of the leading Western powers, hoping to rally international support behind it. The victory plan includes specific military, economic, political, and diplomatic steps aimed at pressuring Russia toward ending its war, Podolyak told the WSJ. According to the advisor, permission to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory could ramp up domestic pressure in Russia, weaken Russian forces, and thus change Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strategic calculus. Ukraine has received several long-range systems from its partners, including U.S.-made ATACMS, French SCALP, and British Storm Shadow, but was not permitted to use them against targets within Russian territory. Podolyak also said that without further aid for Ukraine, the war could continue for years and undermine the Western global standing. If Ukraine is forced to negotiate from a weaker position, it will only embolden Putin to seek full control over the country, he added. Ukraine has provided general outlines of its victory plan but has yet to disclose the full details. Speaking on national television on Oct. 12, Podolyak said that the plan would be published within the coming days. Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s partners for a &quot;decisive action&quot; to bring Russia&apos;s war to an end by next year. The situation grows ever more dire for Kyiv as Russian forces continue grinding on in Ukraine&apos;s east and worries grow about the future U.S. support after the presidential election in November. There are fears that if Donald Trump returns to the White House, he will scale down or withdraw U.S. support and pressure Ukraine toward painful concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/victory-plan-storm-shadow-atacms/	2024-10-14T02:10:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2058352604.jpg
Losing independence is worse than spending a few extra percentage points on defense, Estonian defense minister says	Estonia has emerged as a staunch advocate for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, pushing its NATO allies to step up military aid and make long-term commitments to Kyiv&#x2019;s defense. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur has been at the forefront of this effort, urging Kyiv&apos;s partners not merely to help Ukraine fight on, but also to achieve victory. Sharing a border with Russia, the Baltic country of 1.3 million fears that if Ukraine falls, Tallinn might become the next target of Moscow&apos;s expansionist ambitions. A year and a half after the first interview, the Kyiv Independent sat down with Minister Pevkur again at the Warsaw Security Forum on Oct. 1 to discuss the current state of support for Ukraine and Tallinn&apos;s preparation for a potential clash with Russia. Occupied by Moscow for half a century, Estonia understands the need to invest more in their own defense and to support Kyiv, the minister says. While Estonia is the leading supporter of Ukraine in terms of GDP per capita, Pevkur believes this to be the &quot;absolute minimum&quot; of what the allies need to do. After all, helping Ukraine win the war is the way to avoid an open clash between NATO and Russia, he explains. The Kyiv Independent: Estonia has been spearheading the idea that allies should devote 0.25% of their GDP to military aid to Ukraine every year. Has this proposal found wider support among the allies? Hanno Pevkur: It has. Not all allies are doing that, but many are. The Baltic states, Poland, and Norway, have been doing it for a long time, and Denmark has been doing a lot. So there are many, many allies who are doing that, but this is a trigger to help Ukraine more. We all understand that it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s 0.25% or 1%; the clear aim is still the same: to help Ukraine win the war. The Kyiv Independent: What capabilities does Ukraine need the most right now? Hanno Pevkur: It&apos;s not a secret. Air defense is very critical because Russia is still conducting a huge number of air raids. And that means every layer of the air defense, starting from just machine guns and ending with the Patriots. Of course, ammunition is still very needed on the battlefield. But even with these two main critical needs, Ukraine needs additional training, equipment, basically everything. We are approaching winter, which means that it will also be important to focus on these needs, which are especially important during winter.

(Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Your country has devoted more than 1% of its GDP to aiding Ukraine. Are you worried that this might undermine your own defense capabilities? Hanno Pevkur: Of course, it has affected us. But we understand that this is what we do for Ukraine at the moment. It is the absolute minimum because helping Ukraine today helps them fight this war&#x2026; but not only to fight. I always said that our aim should not be to help Ukraine fight this war, but our aim should be that Ukraine will win this war. We&apos;ve been lucky that Estonian taxpayers have been very understanding, that we have collected new taxes, and we have had some international donors. At the moment, I can say that everything we have in Estonia is now in bigger quantities than it was before the full-scale war started in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Estonia is planning to introduce a security tax, you are planning to increase defense spending, which may eventually have an impact on people&apos;s living standards and the economy. Do you think that Estonian society, and the societies in other Western countries, are ready for that? Hanno Pevkur: If we don&apos;t do that, we risk losing freedom and independence. When you lose independence, then the consequence is much more dramatic than spending a couple of percentages more on defense. We&apos;ve seen that in 1940 and during the 50 years of occupation, we lost dramatically. Before the Second World War, the Estonian economy in terms of GDP was the same as it was in Finland. After 50 years, the difference was 17 times (greater for Finland). So this is the answer: we want to live in freedom, in an independent country. Everybody understands why it is important to pay so much attention to defense. The Kyiv Independent: Your intelligence warned that NATO should be ready for an open clash with Russia within the next decade. What other practical steps is Estonia taking to prepare itself for such an eventuality? Hanno Pevkur: First, we are in an alliance called NATO. This club has been successfully defending the peace in the Euro-Atlantic zone for 75 years. This is the biggest and strongest deterrence for any of our adversaries, that we are strong and even stronger together. Now, Finland and Sweden have also joined NATO, we have increased our defense spending, acquired new ammunition, and a lot of new capabilities in order to defend ourselves. We have basically increased our Territorial Defense Forces two times. We&apos;ve done many things to be ready to defend our country and our people. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur attends the GLOBSEC regional security forum in Prague, Czech Republic on Aug. 31, 2024. (Michal Cizek / AFP via Getty Images)But deterrence means that our defense lies on three pillars. The first one is defense willingness, which is very high in Estonian society. The second one is defense readiness. This is what we are doing. I have already mentioned all the procurements and new capabilities. The third one is defense cooperation, which means NATO, the European Union, bilateral cooperation agreements, and regional cooperation, such as among the Baltic states or the Joint Expeditionary Force (a U.K.-led military partnership in northern Europe). And we have (allied troops) in Estonia. On a daily basis, we have more than 2,000 allied soldiers in Estonia from three nuclear countries: the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. This is a very strong deterrent message. The Kyiv Independent: Russian missiles and drones have repeatedly violated allied airspace, including in your neighbor, Latvia. If Russian projectiles enter Estonian airspace, would the Estonian military shoot them down? Hanno Pevkur: We have a very clear protocol in place for what happens. Don&apos;t forget that we are living in peacetime. During peacetime, the airspace is open, which means that before shooting something down, we have to identify it to be 100% clear and certain what we will shoot down. But the protocol is there, and everybody can be safe and secure. There is a list of measures that will be undertaken if something like this happens. The Kyiv Independent: Some NATO planners projected that in the case of an open clash with Russia, the Baltic states might be overrun before reinforcements can arrive. How do you view these predictions, seeing Ukraine&apos;s experience with Russian occupation? Hanno Pevkur: I don&apos;t have that crystal ball, and I don&apos;t want to have this crystal ball. I know that the Estonian Army is ready to defend our country and our people. I know that our allies are ready to do that and that the new regional plans consider all these risks. We will do everything in the near future to be ready to fully implement these plans. I have no doubts about our allies, and I believe that nobody should have any doubts about the alliance. The Kyiv Independent: How can NATO avoid an open clash with Russia? Hanno Pevkur: To help Ukraine win the war and to do everything to increase defense spending in order to increase defense capabilities. And, of course, we should send out this deterrence message that we are united, that we are not divided, and that we are crystal clear with our actions if necessary.	https://kyivindependent.com/our-aim-should-be-not-to-help-ukraine-fight-but-to-help-it-win-estonian-defense-minister-tells-the-kyiv-independent/	2024-10-14T02:03:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2160736180.jpg
Russia reportedly launches no Shahed drones against Ukraine overnight for first time in over month	Russian forces did not launch any Shahed-type drone overnight on Oct. 14 for the first time since late August, according to monitoring channels. The lull came after Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 1,300 Shahed kamikaze drones in September, launching them across the country on a daily basis for an entire month. This daily trend has continued for the first days of October. Overnight on Oct. 3, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones, targeting settlements across the country. Ukrainian monitoring Telegram channels reported that Russia did not use a single Shahed for the first time in 48 days. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that Moscow&apos;s forces launched several guided aerial bombs against Sumy and Zaporizhzhia oblasts overnight. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. While initially sourcing them from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production.	https://kyivindependent.com/shaheds-oct-14/	2024-10-14T01:19:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
NATO holding annual nuclear drills involving 2,000 troops, 60 aircraft	NATO begins its annual nuclear exercises, Steadfast Noon, on Oct. 14, involving nuclear-capable fighter jets but not live weaponry. The two-week drills will involve over 2,000 military personnel and 60 aircraft from eight airbases. They will take place in Belgium, the Netherlands, and in the airspace over Denmark, the U.K., and the North Sea, with 13 NATO countries sending aircraft to participate. The routine drills come amid heightened tensions as Russia changed its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for its nuclear response. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and its Western partners since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. &quot;Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of Allied security,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said. &quot;Steadfast Noon is an important test of the Alliance&apos;s nuclear deterrent and sends a clear message to any adversary that NATO will protect and defend all Allies.&quot; The drills involve various aircraft, including bombers, fighter escorts, refueling aircraft, and planes capable of reconnaissance and electronic warfare. This year, the first F-35A from the Dutch Air Force was declared ready to perform nuclear roles.	https://kyivindependent.com/steadfast-noon/	2024-10-14T00:54:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1244056280.jpg
Opinion: Documenting war ethically means going beyond capturing suffering	When a country goes through a war, documentarians often feel empowered to capture reality with the aim of creatively reflecting the pain on both a national and personal level. As the history of documentary cinema shows, such conditions can be the birthplace of groundbreaking films that shape the genre. Yet, as film theorist Bill Nichols wrote, &quot;The successful careers of many documentary filmmakers have been built on the misfortune of others.&quot; During Ukraine&apos;s 10 years of war, approaches to documenting reality have continually evolved. Ukrainian filmmakers are often said to use the camera as a weapon, recording war crimes and their consequences through various technologies. However, even with the best of intentions, this weapon can wound. The camera has immense power; it invades the personal space of those experiencing pain and risks turning their suffering into spectacle. The common ethical dilemma is how to portray war effectively while finding the right ethical angle for both the subjects and the audience. This question became crucial when Mstyslav Chernov&#x2019;s &quot;20 Days in Mariupol&quot; won an Oscar, marking the first time a Ukrainian film received such a prestigious award. The film garnered significant attention, shocking global audiences with its brutal depictions of suffering, pain, and death. Chernov skillfully balanced hyper-realistic images with a deeply personal narrative to mitigate ethical risks, even using blurred faces to lessen the stark realism. However, despite these efforts, the film raises the ethical threshold for what can be shown on screen. To impress international audiences again, future filmmakers may have to push beyond the boundaries Chernov crossed. Analyzing films that uncompromisingly depict the full-scale invasion and its victims, critics often turn to theoretical reflections on the ethics of documenting suffering. Susan Sontag&apos;s &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot; is frequently cited for its exploration of the ethics surrounding the capture and viewing of suffering. Several studies have examined the representation of sensitive war images and their mediation to viewers through audiovisual media. While these works analyze a range of conflicts, the authors often reach the same conclusion: Viewers&apos; sensitivity decreases over time, and even the most acute directorial manipulations will inevitably fail to fully convey a victim&apos;s suffering, risking the devaluation of their experience. The good news is that the ethical deadlock Ukrainian documentaries seemed to face did not occur. Instead, directors have undergone a transformation, finding new subgenres and approaches. Globally, recent films about war are more creatively experimental, often narrowing their focus to present and reflect war from a concise angle. War, initially shocking and sudden, becomes a static, prolonged frustration, and Ukrainian documentary cinema has adeptly captured this evolution. A screenshot from the Oscar-nominated Ukrainian documentary &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; which covers Russian forces&apos; siege of Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Facebook)Observational documentaries are becoming more prominent. These films consist primarily of unmediated observations of reality, with minimal interference from the filmmaker. While different approaches exist, Ukrainian documentaries increasingly commit to static shots and a certain detachment from catastrophic events. Ethics are often assessed by the camera&#x2019;s distance from subjects or events, leading to an abundance of long, static shots from afar, with fewer close-ups of suffering faces or bodies. In Olga Zhurba&apos;s &quot;Songs of Slow Burning Earth,&quot; the director metaphorically conveys the waning sensitivity to war through observational filming and poetic editing. The film captures the phenomenon of normalization, portraying the transition from initial shock to stability. Zhurba presents suffering as a canvas that covers all of Ukraine, avoiding the devaluation of any single experience and instead incorporating it into the broader picture of war and its aftermath. Another notable example is JuriRechinsky&apos;s &quot;Dear Beautiful Beloved,&quot; which juxtaposes footage of the evacuation of soldiers&apos; corpses with scenes of elderly evacuees in temporary housing. Rechinsky maintains distance when filming the dead, while drawing closer to the elderly, crafting a humanistic focus. Oksana Karpovych&#x2019;s &quot;Intercepted&quot; offers a unique approach. An observational documentary composed of long static shots of war-torn Ukraine, it minimizes the presence of people and avoids live footage of explosions or battles. The film&#x2019;s power lies in its audio &#x2013; intercepted phone calls from Russian occupiers. The juxtaposition of these calls with images of a devastated Ukraine creates a strong cause-and-effect narrative, radically shifting the focus from the victims to those responsible for their suffering. &quot;Intercepted&quot; may be the most internationally recognized Ukrainian film of 2024, a striking example of how to depict war without exploiting pain. Another emerging trend in Ukrainian documentary cinema is character-driven storytelling. These films focus on creating in-depth portraits of individuals or social groups, often set against the backdrop of war. By spending significant time with their subjects, filmmakers show solidarity with their pain, employing a more intimate cinematic language. This approach is evident in &quot;Mission 200,&quot; which follows a volunteer who transports soldiers&apos; bodies. Director Volodymyr Sydko focuses on protagonist Tetyana&#x2019;s monologues, allowing her to slowly trust the camera, while bodies in black bags remain in the background of the story. Character-driven documentaries also offer opportunities to explore narrow social contexts unfamiliar to Western audiences. Lesia Diak&#x2019;s &quot;Dad&#x2019;s Lullaby&quot; follows a man who served in Donbas before the full-scale invasion, struggling to return to family life. Diak, who has personal experience with post-traumatic behavior from dating a military man, navigates the ethical risks by sharing her own painful reflections on camera, filming herself from the same distance she maintains from her protagonist. As the war continues, Ukrainian filmmakers are finding new ethical approaches that keep their documentaries in the global conversation. It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that we will see even more innovative and thoughtful approaches in the future, as filmmakers balance the experiences of both those who suffer and those who watch.

Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 8 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured eight others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 14. Four people were killed in the town of Chasiv Yar and in the villages of Zvanivka and Vyshneve in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Three more people were injured in the region over the past day. A 56-year-old man suffered injuries as a result of a Russian drone attack in the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted eight settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed, and four were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian attacks damaged three high-rise buildings, six houses, cars, gas pipelines, and a warehouse. One person was killed, and four others injured, according to the governor.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-5-injure-7-over-past-day/	2024-10-14T00:32:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-13_09-50-53.jpg
US ready for talks with Russia, China, North Korea to reduce nuclear threat, Biden says	Washington is ready to engage in talks with Russia, China, and North Korea without preconditions to reduce the nuclear threat, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Oct. 13. Biden made his statement while congratulating the winners of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo grouping survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan almost 80 years ago, for their campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons. The comments came after Russia adopted changes to its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for its nuclear response. &quot;There is no benefit to our nations or the world to forestall progress on reducing nuclear arsenals,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Reducing the nuclear threat is important not despite the dangers of today&#x2019;s world but precisely because of them.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. In late September, Putin expanded the scenarios that could trigger a Russian nuclear response, including reliable intelligence of a large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones. He also said that any attack on Russia backed by a nuclear power would be treated as a joint assault. The Kremlin claimed the move was a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. North Korea has become one of Russia&apos;s leading allies in its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing ammunition and missiles and reportedly sending military staff to aid Russian forces. China claimed neutrality in the war but backed Moscow in the face of Western sanctions and became Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods feeding the Russian defense industry. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of &quot;increasing alliance&quot; between Moscow and Pyongyang on Oct. 13 following reports that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ready-for-talks-with/	2024-10-14T00:25:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
German opposition leader would deliver Taurus to Ukraine after certain steps	Friedrich Merz, an opposition candidate for the German chancellor, said he is open to supplying Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine but under some conditions, N-TV reported on Oct. 14. Despite providing extensive military aid to Kyiv, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been adamant in his position not to approve the supply of the Taurus missiles, citing a fear of escalation. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do it just like that,&quot; Merz said on the ARD channel regarding the supply of the Taurus missiles. At first, there should be an appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop attacking civilian targets in Ukraine. If Moscow does not concede, Ukraine should be free to use already delivered weapons without restrictions, said the German opposition leader. Merz is the parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate of the center-right CDU/CSU, which is leading the polls one year before the federal parliamentary elections. This makes him currently the most likely candidate to unseat social democrat Scholz. &quot;And the second step would be to supply the Taurus missiles. Then it is up to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to decide how far he wants to escalate this war,&quot; Merz said. Taurus is a joint German-Swedish cruise missile with a range of over 500 kilometers (310 miles). It boasts a longer reach than missiles that Ukraine has received from other partners, such as the British-French-made SCALP/Storm Shadow and American ATACMS. Merz criticized the ruling coalition for allowing Moscow to know all the details of its strategy by discussing its steps publicly. The opposition leader added that the decision on the Taurus supply should be made at the European level and that European countries should become less dependent on the U.S. regarding support for Ukraine. While Ukraine has deployed Western long-range arms for strikes against Russian military targets within Ukrainian territory, Kyiv&apos;s partners have not permitted their use on Russian soil. Washington and Berlin have permitted the use of certain German and American weaponry just across the Russian border to disrupt Russia&apos;s offensive operations. Scholz has been under prolonged pressure from his opponents in the parliament and, reportedly, even coalition partners to greenlight the supply of Taurus. The German chancellor said he would not approve their supply even if other partners decided to lift restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-taurus-missiles/	2024-10-13T23:35:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161390043.jpg
Russian Tu-134 aircraft set ablaze in Orenburg Oblast, military intelligence claims	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A Russian Tu-134 military transport aircraft was set on fire at a military airfield in Orenburg Oblast overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. &quot;Such Soviet aircraft are used, in particular, to transport the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; HUR said. According to the agency, the plane, which belonged to the 117th Military Transport Aviation Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces, burned down at the Orenburg-2 airfield. HUR shared footage showing the fire, without claiming responsibility for the incident. &quot;Every crime against the Ukrainian people will be duly punished,&quot; the agency added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-tu-134/	2024-10-13T22:45:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-14-083810.png
Russia hasn't received request for Scholz-Putin call, Kremlin claims	Moscow has not received a proposal from Berlin for a phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian pro-state news agency Interfax on Oct. 13. &quot;No. There were no proposals. We have said repeatedly that Putin remains open to contact,&quot; Peskov claimed. The statement came two days after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Putin is not willing to speak with Scholz about brokering peace in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to accept peace and every day sends another signal in favor of war and destruction. These days, he is no longer even prepared to speak to the German chancellor on the phone,&quot; the German foreign minister said. The German newspaper Zeit reported on Oct. 1 that, according to government sources, Scholz is hoping to talk to Putin by phone for the first time in almost two years. A German government spokesperson said in September that Scholz would talk to Putin &quot;when the time comes,&quot; but &quot;for now, we have to wait.&quot; The two leaders held the last phone call in December 2022. The German chancellor met Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky during the latter&apos;s visit to Berlin on Oct. 11. Scholz used the occasion to reveal the delivery of a $660-million aid package, including an IRIS-T air defense system, to Ukraine. Berlin will also work together with Belgium, Denmark, and Norway to supply Ukraine with an assistance tranche worth $1.5 billion, the chancellor said. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. In a media interview in early September, Scholz urged speedier efforts at resolving the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,&quot; the chancellor said.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-scholz/	2024-10-13T22:35:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 670,190 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 670,190 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 14. This number includes 1,260 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,975 tanks, 17,895 armored fighting vehicles, 26,622 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,421 artillery systems, 1,231 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,009 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-670-190-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-13T22:10:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-2164069605.jpg
Lukashenko claims Russian nuclear realignment was long overdue	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, in a comment to a Russian reporter, said that recent changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear weapons policy were long overdue and would likely &apos;cool the ardor&apos; of Western nations. In a video published on Oct. 13, Lukashenko noted that &quot;hotheads&quot; in the West had already noticed nuclear signals from Moscow even before President Vladimir Putin announced the policy changes last month. On Sept. 25, Putin expanded the scenarios that could trigger a Russian nuclear response, including reliable intelligence of a large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones. He also emphasized that any attack on Russia backed by a nuclear power would be treated as a joint assault. The Kremlin&#x2019;s move was a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. &quot;This doctrine should have been renewed long ago,&quot; Lukashenko remarked. Last year, he agreed with Putin to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. He warned that without Putin&#x2019;s earlier nuclear signals, &quot;Western missiles would already be bombing us, especially Russia.&quot; Ukraine has condemned Russia&apos;s nuclear posture as blackmail, with President Volodymyr Zelensky urging Western leaders to ignore Putin&apos;s &quot;red lines.&quot; Moscow insists that its warnings are genuine. Putin warned that if the U.S. and its allies approve Ukraine&#x2019;s use of long-range missiles, they will be directly engaging in the war against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-claims-russian-nuclear-realignment-was-long-overdue/	2024-10-13T21:41:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Orban threatens to interfere with Ukraine aid to support Trump, Politico reports	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is preparing to deliver a significant policy concession to former President Donald Trump, potentially allowing him to evade a $50 billion loan intended to support Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia. Should Trump win the presidency in November, this move would enable him to reassure Republican voters that he would not provide additional financial assistance to Ukraine, Politico reported on Oct. 14. Hungary has said it will not approve changes to rules permitting the U.S. to take a substantial role in the loan until after the U.S. election. The proposed loan relies on the profits from over $250 billion in Russian assets frozen in Western countries following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While the U.S. insists that the European Union extend the sanctions renewal period from six months to a minimum of 36 months to facilitate this arrangement, Orban has opposed this extension. He alone can block the necessary changes since all 27 EU member states must agree to any modifications in sanctions rules. Ukraine urgently requires fresh funding to sustain its government and prepare for a harsh winter as Russia targets its energy infrastructure. Orban&apos;s stance significantly complicates the U.S. involvement, yet Europe appears prepared to move forward regardless. An EU diplomat who talked to Politico on conditions of anonymity said: &quot;If we don&#x2019;t work this out [by extending the sanctions duration], it will cost the EU &#x2014; including Hungary &#x2014; more money.&quot; &quot;They [Hungary] don&#x2019;t care if Europe has to pay more. It&#x2019;s about helping Trump,&quot; another EU diplomat said. If the loan proceeds without U.S. participation, Trump would not be obligated to service it if reelected, significantly benefiting him politically. As Orban threatened to use his veto power in Brussels, the U.S. signaled it might still participate in the loan, albeit for a reduced amount, of around $5 billion, equating to the Russian assets held domestically. If Hungary remains unyielding on the sanctions duration, the EU plans to finalize the loan independently, as its budget rules facilitate quicker approval before year-end.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-threatens-to-interfere-with-ukraine-aid-to-support-trump-politico-reports/	2024-10-13T19:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1143562490.jpg
Nearly 37,000 residents evacuated from Sumy Oblast, additional efforts ongoing, military says	A total of nearly 37,000 residents have been evacuated from Sumy Oblast, including over 6,400 children, as efforts are ongoing to evacuate more residents under expanded mandatory evacuation orders, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said on Oct. 13. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks, and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs near the border areas of Sumy Oblast. Officials said in late August that are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from Sumy Oblast. Since then, an additional 16,000 people have been evacuated from the region, including 535 adults and 143 children in the past week. The evacuations continue after local authorities on Sept. 30 further ordered mandatory evacuation of children accompanied by their parents from an expanded area within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia. All residents within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia have already been evacuated entirely, the military administration noted. On Oct. 13, Russia attacked six communities in Sumy Oblast causing 21 explosions throughout the day, the military administration reported. Residents in the region have typically experience living through hundreds of explosions on a daily basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-37-000-people-evacuated-from-sumy-oblast-additional-efforts-ongoing-military-says/	2024-10-13T16:13:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1973286879.jpg
Kyiv considering ceding territory to end war with Russia, Der Spiegel reports	The Ukrainian government is considering options to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war that would involve temporarily suspending its goal of restoring Ukraine&apos;s full territorial integrity, the German news outlet Der Spiegel reported on Oct. 13, citing an official close to the Ukrainian government. Over 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory is currently under Russian occupation. A pillar of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula for Ukraine involves the full liberation of all occupied territories, and Kyiv has repeatedly said it is not willing to make territorial concessions to Moscow. The government is now holding &quot;serious discussions&quot; about relinquishing its aim of full territorial restoration, an unnamed official told Der Spiegel. &quot;We believed that victory had to mean the unconditional surrender of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s Russia,&quot; the source reportedly said. This was &quot;a mistaken view of victory,&quot; the source claimed, saying an agreement to end the war would be impossible without some concessions. Factors pushing Kyiv to consider territorial concessions include Russia&apos;s grinding advance in eastern Ukraine and the uncertain outcome of the U.S. presidential election, according to the official. &quot;Whether it&apos;s (former U.S. President Donald) Trump or (Vice President Kamala) Harris, the Americans will slowly but surely withdraw,&quot; the official told Der Spiegel. Trump has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine, calling Zelensky a &quot;salesman&quot; and pledging to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict if re-elected. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, recently told the press he has no &quot;appetite for further Ukraine funding.&quot; Harris, by contrast, has taken sharp aim at proposals to end the war that involve Ukraine giving up large portions of its sovereign territory. &quot;These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, these are not proposals for peace,&quot; Harris said on Sept. 26. &quot;Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.&quot; Russian troops partially control Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Moscow claims to have annexed the entire territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Russian forces also occupy Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. &#xA0; Polling from July of this year shows that 55% of Ukrainians oppose territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for peace. The number is lower than that recorded in previous surveys: Polls in February and December 2023 found that 65% and 74%, respectively, opposed such concessions. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Presidential Office, said on Sept. 17 that none of the plans Ukraine is developing to end Russia&apos;s war envisages a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow, despite some media reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-considering-ceding-territory-to-end-war-with-russia-der-spiegel-reports-2/	2024-10-13T13:22:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162534022-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine is holding front line in Kursk Oblast despite Russian attacks, Zelensky says	Key developments on Oct. 13: Ukrainian troops are holding the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast despite Russian attempts to break through, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 12. &quot;There were attempts by Russia to push back our positions. But we are holding the defined lines,&quot; he said. Zelensky posted the comments on his official Telegram channel after Russian military sources claimed the prior day to have recaptured nearly two dozen settlements in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Russian forces have likely advanced within at least 13 settlements in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces had previously reportedly operated in as of Oct. 11,&quot; according to analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also commented on the issue on his Telegram channel on Oct. 12. &quot;Active fighting continues in Kursk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;After (Ukrainian troops) partially regained the positions where the Russians had entered, (Russian troops) began to send columns to attack again.&quot; Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. Earlier in the week, U.S. officials assessed that Ukraine has the ability to hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation after Russian troops reportedly shot nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime. A criminal case has been opened over the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,&quot; Kostin posted on X. &quot;We are doing our utmost to identify and prosecute all those responsible for the aggressor&apos;s crimes committed against Ukraine and Ukrainians.&quot; The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, the crowd-sourced monitoring group DeepState reported on Oct. 13, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiga posted on X on Oct 13, calling for the international community to take immediate action by issuing warrants for Russian executioners, increasing sanctions, and demanding access to detention sites. &quot;Russia&apos;s mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war is absolute barbarism, grave violation of international humanitarian law, laws and customs of war. Executions are becoming more frequent, 95% of POWs are subjected to torture according to the UN, denied basic needs and access,&quot; he wrote. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about the execution cases in Kursk to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4. Russian forces are using black-market Starlink internet terminals en masse on the front lines in Ukraine, contributing to territorial gains, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 12. Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial battlefield advantage. While SpaceX does not sell units to Russia directly, Russian troops in Ukraine continue to obtain Starlink terminals through shadowy supply chains and intermediaries. The proliferation of Starlink terminals among Russian front-line troops has contributed to Moscow&apos;s recent battlefield gains, including the occupation of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the WP reports, citing several Ukrainian soldiers and military officers. &quot;They just overpowered us,&quot; an officer in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, one of the units defending Vuhledar, told the WP. The officer said Russia&apos;s access to Starlink was a key factor in the loss of the city, along with weapons and personnel shortages. A drone platoon commander with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade said that while Ukraine&apos;s Starlink terminals previously gave them a technological edge over Russian forces, that advantage has now disappeared. &quot;Before, the Russians couldn&apos;t control some of their movements, maneuvers, artillery, infantry,&quot; he said. When Ukraine intercepted Russian radio transmissions, they observed soldiers frequently giving incomplete or wrong information to their commanders, the platoon commander said. That has now changed. &quot;Now they will only improve, and unfortunately, that&apos;s what&apos;s happening across the board,&quot; he said. Russia has used around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine this week alone, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia also launched more than 40 missiles and 400 combat drones of various types, Zelensky said in a video address posted on Telegram. &quot;No nation should go through such trials alone. Our partners have the opportunity to provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems, to make decisions about our sufficient range, and to ensure the timely delivery of defense assistance to our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We must not waste time - we must give the necessary signal of determination.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-is-holding-front-line-in-kursk-oblast-despite-russian-attacks-zelensky-says/	2024-10-13T11:48:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172545405.jpg
Zelensky warns of 'increasing alliance' between Russia, North Korea	Russia&apos;s deepening alliance with North Korea necessitates a strong response from Ukraine and its international partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 13. The president&apos;s remarks follow reports that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. &quot;We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in his address. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; In light of this escalation, Ukraine&apos;s front-line troops need &quot;more support,&quot; Zelensky said, emphasizing that support for Kyiv extends beyond weapons deliveries. &quot;It is about increasing pressure on the aggressor, which will be stronger than they can withstand. And it is about preventing a bigger war,&quot; he said. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers in early October that North Korea was likely planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed these reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Kyiv will hold additional talks with Western partners in the coming days on Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. &quot;(I)t is absolutely realistic to strengthen the position of our country, to strengthen the position of Ukraine exactly as it is necessary for a fair peace,&quot; he said. &quot;And right now we need to act to prevent Russia and its allies from adapting to our capabilities.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-increasing-alliance-between-russia-north-korea/	2024-10-13T11:04:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-1.jpeg
Estonia considering buying defense equipment from Ukraine, official says	Estonia is considering the possibility of purchasing defense supplies from Ukraine, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said on Oct. 13, according to local media. Ukraine&apos;s martial law prohibits the export of defense equipment, but Pevkur said it might be possible to circumvent these restrictions if both countries came to a mutually beneficial agreement. An agreement of this kind could help Ukraine increase defense production, Pevkur said, according to the Estonian media outlet ERR. &quot;If we receive consent from the Ukrainian government, then, of course, this can be done,&quot; Pevkur said. &quot;We need to understand here that this can only be done in such a way that if we buy, then Ukraine gets more money. And they will be able to produce more for their army.&quot; Kyiv has scaled up defense production over the past two years and aims to become a global leader in the defense sector. Ukraine now has the capacity to produce around $20 billion worth of weapons and equipment, according to government estimates, but the state budget can only fund around $6 billion. Pevkur said that if Tallinn and Kyiv reach a defense purchase agreement, Estonia will only buy equipment the country most urgently needs. &quot;Long-range missiles are, of course, interesting for us,&quot; the Estonian defense minister said. &quot;There are many different options. Of course, we cannot talk in detail, but first of all, we will look at these systems that can affect the enemy at a long range.&quot; Pevkur will meet with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Brussels next week, and also plans to visit Ukraine in the near future. Estonia and Ukraine signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on June 26. The deal stipulates that Estonia will supply Ukraine with defense aid worth more than 100 million euro ($107 million) this year and will allocate at least 0.25% of its gross domestic product (GDP) annually for military support in 2024&#x2013;2027. Kyiv and Tallinn will also will launch a regular &quot;strategic dialogue&quot; and deepen their military-industrial cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-considering-buying-defense-equipment-from-ukraine-official-says/	2024-10-13T10:31:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSC02033.jpg
Russia's illegal use of Starlink terminals hastened fall of Vuhledar, WP reports	Russian forces are using black-market Starlink internet terminals en masse on the front lines in Ukraine, contributing to territorial gains, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 12. Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial battlefield advantage. While SpaceX does not sell units to Russia directly, Russian troops in Ukraine continue to obtain Starlink terminals through shadowy supply chains and intermediaries. The proliferation of Starlink terminals among Russian front-line troops has contributed to Moscow&apos;s recent battlefield gains, including the occupation of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the WP reports, citing several Ukrainian soldiers and military officers. &quot;They just overpowered us,&quot; an officer in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, one of the units defending Vuhledar, told the WP. The officer said Russia&apos;s access to Starlink was a key factor in the loss of the city, along with weapons and personnel shortages. A drone platoon commander with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade said that while Ukraine&apos;s Starlink terminals previously gave them a technological edge over Russian forces, that advantage has now disappeared. &quot;Before, the Russians couldn&apos;t control some of their movements, maneuvers, artillery, infantry,&quot; he said. When Ukraine intercepted Russian radio transmissions, they observed soldiers frequently giving incomplete or wrong information to their commanders, the platoon commander said. That has now changed. &#xA0; &quot;Now they will only improve, and unfortunately, that&apos;s what&apos;s happening across the board,&quot; he said. Starlink allows for faster, more secure communications and has thus become indispensable to Ukraine&apos;s ability to communicate on the battlefield. Russia&apos;s previous reliance on radio communications set the otherwise larger, better-armed force at a disadvantage. The Pentagon, which financially supports Starlink access for the Ukrainian military, announced in May 2024 that it is working to prevent Russian troops from using the terminals in Ukraine. The U.S. has become &quot;heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals,&quot; &#xA0;Defense Department Assistant Secretary for Space Policy John Plumb said on May 9. Despite these assurances, Starlink use has continued to expand across Russian lines this year, the WP reported. Ukrainian troops near the embattled front-line city of Pokrovsk said they began seeing Starlinks in Russian positions beginning last month. A battalion commander in the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade said Russia&apos;s Starlink access helped them advance toward Pokrovsk and that more must be done to combat Russian use of the devices. &quot;It is something that kills us,&quot; he said. Disabling Russia&apos;s terminals has become difficult in part due to shifting front lines, Stacie Pettyjohn, defense program director for the Center for a New American Security, told the WP. &quot;Ukrainian forces are in Russia now. Where exactly are the front lines?&quot; she said. &quot;If there&apos;s a line drawn as to where it works and where it doesn&apos;t, you&#x2019;re basically fixing the front lines where they are and preventing the Ukrainians from going on the offensive.&quot; Disruptions to Ukrainian troops&apos; Starlink access have occurred before, particularly during Russia&apos;s spring offensive against Kharkiv Oblast and when Ukrainian forces launched their incursion into Kursk Oblast in August. Musk has denied selling any Starlink units to Russia and said that Starlink would not connect to any devices there. Russian soldiers nonetheless continue to obtain devices through a robust black market supply chain. According to the WP&apos;s analysis of some Russian sites selling military supplies, the Starlink terminals are most often sold via Telegram and travel to the front via Moscow. The majority of terminals come from Europe and are transported through the United Arab Emirates, with warnings not to activate the device in Russia. &#xA0; To activate the terminal, users require a foreign phone number, email address, and bank account. Tymofii, a drone pilot with the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, said Russian forces appeared to have no shortage of Starlink terminals. &quot;They have a lot of them. &#x2026; They use them the same way we do,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-illegal-use-of-starlink-terminals-hastened-fall-of-vuhledar-wp-reports/	2024-10-13T09:44:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1259126916.jpeg
Defense minister confirms more weapons pledges, arms production after foreign visit	A meeting with Western defense partners yielded &quot;concrete results&quot; for Ukraine, &#xA0;Defense Minister Rustem Umerov reported on Oct. 13. Umerov visited counterparts from France, the U.K., Italy, and Germany as part of a delegation headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;(A)ll four countries confirmed that investments in Ukraine&apos;s industrial-defense complex will grow,&quot; Umerov said via Telegram. The U.K. pledged to provide additional long-range weapons, artillery systems, and &#xA0;robotic systems, while French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the possibility of opening a training center for drone operators in France, according to the announcement. Frozen Russian assets will be used to finance Ukraine&apos;s defense needs, Umerov said. &quot;We discussed specific steps to increase the production of weapons &#x2014; both in Ukraine and through the creation of joint ventures with our European partners,&quot; Umerov said. &quot;This will make it possible to manufacture equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Defense Forces within a fundamentally new format of cooperation.&quot; Kyiv now aims to become a global leader in the defense sector, but with its economy drained by the war, it needs foreign investment and partnerships to accomplish this goal. Ukraine has the capacity to produce around $20 billion worth of weapons and equipment, according to government estimates, but the state budget can only fund around $6 billion. Foreign companies are increasingly making deals to jointly produce weaponry in Ukraine, including 155 shells, loitering munitions, and specialty chemicals. &#xA0; Earlier this month, Zelensky highlighted that Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-minister-confirms-more-defense-production-cooperation-and-weapons-pledges-after-foreign-visit/	2024-10-13T08:19:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Media: Biden to visit Germany on Oct. 18	U.S. President Joe Biden will visit Germany on Oct. 18 after an earlier trip was postponed due to Hurricane Milton in the Gulf of Mexico, according to media reports published on Oct. 13. Biden will meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Olaf Scholz during his visit, according to the German publication Der Spiegel. They are expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Biden was supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12, where President Volodymyr Zelensky was expected to present his victory plan. However, he put off his visit in order to oversee the emergency response to Hurricane Milton. The Germany trip, originally planned as a formal state visit with a banquet and formal events before a new U.S. president is elected in November, has now been pared down to primarily work events, according to Der Spiegel.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-biden-to-visit-germany-on-oct-18/	2024-10-13T08:09:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175587602.jpg

Zelensky: Russia has used around 900 aerial bombs against Ukraine this week	Russia has used around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine this week alone, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia also launched more than 40 missiles and 400 combat drones of various types, Zelensky said in a video address posted on Telegram. &quot;No nation should go through such trials alone. Our partners have the opportunity to provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems, to make decisions about our sufficient range, and to ensure the timely delivery of defense assistance to our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We must not waste time - we must give the necessary signal of determination.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-russia-has-used-around-900-guided-aerial-bombs-against-ukraine-this-week/	2024-10-13T06:59:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Prosecutors open investigation into alleged killing of 9 POWs by Russians in Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation after Russian troops reportedly shot nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime. A criminal case has been opened over the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,&quot; Kostin posted on X. &quot;We are doing our utmost to identify and prosecute all those responsible for the aggressor&apos;s crimes committed against Ukraine and Ukrainians.&quot; The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, the crowd-sourced monitoring group Deepstate reported on Oct. 13, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about these cases to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. &#xA0; Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/prosecutor-generals-office-is-investigating-alleged-killing-of-9-pows-by-russians/	2024-10-13T05:30:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
Ukraine is holding front line in Kursk Oblast despite Russian attacks, Zelensky says	Ukrainian troops are holding the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast despite Russian attempts to break through, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 12. &quot;There were attempts by Russia to push back our positions. But we are holding the defined lines,&quot; he said. Zelensky posted the comments on his official Telegram channel after Russian military sources claimed the prior day to have recaptured nearly two dozen settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), &quot;ISW assesses that Russian forces have likely advanced within at least 13 settlements in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces had previously reportedly operated in as of Oct. 11.&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also commented on the issue on his Telegram channel on Oct. 12. &quot;Active fighting continues in Kursk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;After (Ukrainian troops) partially regained the positions where the Russians had entered, (Russian troops) began to send columns to attack again.&quot; Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. Earlier in the week, U.S. officials assessed that Ukraine has the ability to hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-holding-defined-lines-despite-russians-pushing-back-in-kursk-zelensky-says/	2024-10-13T04:11:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230.jpg
Russian troops reportedly shoot 9 Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast	Nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners were allegedly shot by Russian troops in Kursk Oblast earlier this week, the crowd-sourced monitoring site Deepstate reported on Oct. 13. The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, Deepstate reported, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. &quot;Information about the possible shooting by the Russians of nine Ukrainian prisoners of war in Kursk Oblast is again spreading in social networks,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in a statement on Telegram. &quot;Such actions are a gross violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.&quot; Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4. According to the prosecutors, 80% of those were recorded in 2024. &quot;Since November 2023, the approach of the Russian military toward our prisoners has significantly changed for the worse,&quot; Yurii Belousov, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-reportedly-shoot-9-surrendering-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region/	2024-10-13T03:04:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Mash-1.jpg
Russian fighter jets likely left Belarus, monitoring group says	Two Russian MiG-31K jets that were transferred to Belarus this week have most likely returned to Russia, the Belarusian monitoring group Hajun reported on Oct. 12. &quot;Based on the available information, we know that after takeoff the MiG-31Ks did not return to the Machulyshchi airfield. The fighters took a course to the south, flew past Baranovichi and then to the east &#x2014; towards the Russian Federation,&quot; the group posted on Telegram. &#xA0; &quot;Thus, at the moment, it is most likely that the MiGs left the territory of Belarus after takeoff and returned to Russia,&quot; the group added. The two MiG-31K jets landed in Belarus on Oct. 9 and 10, a year and a half after their last appearance in Belarus. Their sudden appearance at the airfield prompted speculation from Ukrainian officials and military experts that Russia may have moved the jets to Belarus to evade Ukrainian strikes, or to prepare for another massive attack. The jets can fly at speeds of up to 3,000 kilometers per hour and launch Kinzhal missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers, putting all of Ukraine at risk. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly had 12 MiG-31s in service. However, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia&#x2019;s Savasleyka airbase on Aug. 16 destroyed at least one MiG-31 and possibly damaged another, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fighter-jets-leave-belarus-says-monitoring-group/	2024-10-13T01:33:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240502848.jpg

Air Force: Ukraine downs 31 drones overnight	Ukraine shot down 31 of 68 combat drones Russia launched overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said in its morning update. Anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire units were engaged in repelling the aerial assault. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy oblasts. Russia also attacked Ukraine with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and two Kh-59 cruise missiles, the Air Force said. The missiles targeted Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Odesa oblasts. Drone attacks are a daily occurrence in Ukraine, affecting various regions across the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-ukraine-downs-31-drones-overnight/	2024-10-13T00:26:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147853376-3.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of nearly 73,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Through open-source research, Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, together with BBC Russia, confirmed the names of 72,899 Russian soldiers who had been killed since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in late-September, the names of 1,842 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. According to the journalist, Russian soldiers killed in action in 2024 tend to be increasingly older in age as the average age for volunteer recruits continues to soar. The plurality of volunteer recruits killed in the war fall most prominently between the ages of 48 and 50 years old. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,100 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 13,438 Russian inmates have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. A surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. The last few month, amid the renewed Kharkiv offensive as well as Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. On July 5, Russian media outlets Meduza and Mediazona published an estimated report indicating that approximately 120,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine - although that number is likely significantly higher in the months since the report&apos;s release. As of August 12, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 667,630 troops - which likely includes Russian military personnel that have been killed, injured, captured, and missing in action.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-nearly-73-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-10-12T17:54:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/kch-0854-1663443200tnjak.jpg
Zelensky to publicly unveil 'victory plan' in coming days, Podolyak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky will publicly unveil his &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukrainians in &quot;a matter of days,&quot; Presidential Office advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Oct. 12. Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Zelensky has already presented, to mixed results, the victory plan to a number of Western leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among others. &quot;The key points are already clear, but (Zelensky) will add details that will clearly state what kind of programme of pressure it is, why it is important, and why it is parallel (to the peace formula), Podolyak said on the country&apos;s marathon TV broadcast, Ukrainska Pravda reported. Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Sept. 29 that the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; Yermak said. Zelensky has said that the plan is designed to push Russian President Vladimir Putin into a fair peace agreement by boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s firepower, including by requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes - giving it an upper hand two and a half years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;It is important to understand what we are going to do at each stage of the war. I think the president will deliver the presentation quite effectively,&quot; Podolyak concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-publicly-unveil-victory-plan-in-coming-days-podolyak-says/	2024-10-12T16:10:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
Ukraine, France working to establish joint defense production, Zelensky says	Ukraine is working with France to establish new joint defense production facilities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 12. The developing production agreement comes following Zelensky&apos;s visit to Paris on Oct. 10 where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier this week, Zelensky embarked on a multi-country tour of various European allies aiming to present his &quot;victory plan&quot; as well as discuss further military support. &quot;Every foreign visit is always a conversation about investment in Ukraine&apos;s industrial sector,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. Although Zelensky did not provide specifics on the development of the production partnership, he pointed to the success of the Danish model in attracting investments in defense production. In June, Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. &quot;The Danish model already works... &#xA0;and we consider the new French model as an opportunity to attract investments specifically to establish new production facilities,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that the countries&apos; respective defense ministries are working on establishing an agreement. &#x201C;This is a personal task for the Minister of Defense, for the Ministry of Strategic Industries to ensure that all our agreements are fulfilled.&quot; Earlier this week, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said that he expects Ukraine to receive the first Mirage 2000 fighter jets from France in the first quarter of 2025. Ukraine continues to ramp up domestic ammunition and drone production as it attempts to become more independent from its Western partners. Despite the country&apos;s best efforts, Ukraine continues to rely on foreign financing as the state can only cover part of the budget.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-france-working-to-establish-joint-defense-production-facilities-zelensky-says/	2024-10-12T14:54:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155833496.jpg
Kyiv Independent's 'He Came Back' documentary wins Best Film award at Prague film festival	The Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigative documentary &quot;He Came Back,&quot; which uncovers sexual crimes committed during the Russian occupation of Kyiv and Kherson oblasts in early 2022, won the Best Film award at the Press Play Prague film festival on Oct. 12. The festival, organized by three Czech Republic-based organizations&#x2014;Project Syndicate, Referendum Daily (Denik Referendum), and Atlas Cinema&#x2014;was held in Prague from Oct. 8 to 12 and emphasized the crucial role of journalism in contemporary society. The festival screened over 20 films and presented six feature-length and six short documentaries across two competition categories. Deputy Chief Editor Toma Istomina presented the film and shared insights on investigating sexual war crimes in Ukraine. The documentary, authored by Olesia Bida, highlights that Ukrainian law enforcement has documented 292 cases of sexual violence by Russian soldiers, a figure that is likely just a fraction of the total. Two survivors shared their stories with the journalists, who managed to identify the soldiers responsible for the rapes, along with their commanding officers. In one case, the team reconstructed the crime by working undercover, contacting civilians and military personnel in occupied Donetsk Oblast to uncover key details. Other Kyiv Independent team members behind the project include Vitalii Havura, Max Yakobchuk, Kostiantyn Nechyporenko, and Yevheniia Motorevska.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independents-he-came-back-documentary-wins-best-film-award-at-prague-film-festival/	2024-10-12T13:52:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/hecame-back.jpeg
Iran delivers satellites to Russia for rocket launch, media reports	Iran has delivered two domestically manufactured satellites to Russia for an upcoming launch, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Oct. 12. This marks the latest instance of space collaboration between the two nations, both of which are under U.S. sanctions. The satellites, Kowsar and Hodhod, represent Iran&#x2019;s first significant venture from its private space sector. They were reportedly dispatched to Russia on Oct. 11. Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, is designed for agricultural use, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Meanwhile, Hodhod, a small communications satellite, aims to provide satellite-based connectivity in remote areas with limited terrestrial networks. A group of young Iranian engineers, with an average age of 25, spearheaded the project at a private Iranian tech company, according to Tasnim. Russia previously launched Iranian satellites into orbit in February and again in 2022, raising concerns from U.S. officials about the potential military implications. These officials worry that the satellites could support Russia&apos;s operations in Ukraine and help Iran monitor military targets across Israel and the Middle East. In a related development, Iran successfully conducted its second satellite launch this year in September, using a rocket developed by the Revolutionary Guards. The launch comes amid accusations from the U.S. and European nations that Iran has supplied Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine&#x2014;claims that Tehran has repeatedly denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran-delivers-satellites-to-russia-for-rocket-launch-media-reports/	2024-10-12T11:52:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2002625944.jpg
Serbia makes deal with Gazprom for extra 400 million cubic meters of gas this winter	Serbia has signed an agreement with Russia for additional gas supplies this winter despite efforts to diversify, Serbian media Danas reported on Oct. 10. Dusan Bajatovic, CEO of the Serbian state-owned company Srbijagas, came to an agreement with Alexey Miller, CEO of Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom, and expects Russian gas supplies to reach 400 million cubic meters this winter. Both parties met in St. Petersburg during the International Gas Forum. Belgrade signed a three-year deal with Gazprom in May 2022, shortly after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, and the gas deliveries will be under the same contract. Bajatovic said that Serbia will consider extending the deal in the first quarter of 2025. Miller and Bajatovic also discussed the expansion of an underground gas storage facility in Banatski Dvor, northern Serbia, to 750 million cubic meters. The project is already underway and Serbia reached an agreement with Gazprom to use Russian technology on Oct. 8. Serbia, which has maintained friendly relations with Moscow, is heavily reliant on Russian gas and consumes around 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas annually, of which Gazprom provides around 2 billion. Russian gas enters Serbia via the TurkStream and Balkan Stream pipelines, bypassing Ukraine which transits Russian gas to Central Europe. Ukraine has said it will end its transit contract with Gazprom at the end of the year and many EU countries are already moving away from Russian gas imports, including Croatia and Slovenia. Hungary, which has also maintained ties with Russia, still imports Russian gas through Ukraine and also utilizes the TurkStream pipeline.Belgrade has started looking at alternative options too after facing pressure from the EU. Despite its refusal to sanction Moscow, Serbia still wants to join the EU and toes the line between East and West. Belgrade signed a contract with Baku in November, 2023 to deliver 400 million cubic meters of gas from 2024-2026 and a billion cubic meters from 2027. On Oct. 7, Belgrade and North Macedonia signed a memorandum of understanding for a 70-kilometer pipeline that will link Serbia to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Alexandroupolis, Greece. An agreement was also concluded with Romania for a gas interconnector on Aug. 6, which will have a bidirectional capacity of 1.6 billion cubic meters.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbia-makes-deal-with-gazprom-for-extra-400-million-cubic-meters-of-gas-this-winter/	2024-10-12T09:10:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1237563205.jpg
Russia may have moved MiG-31 jets to Belarus to evade Ukrainian strikes	Two Russian MiG-31K jets were transferred to Belarus this week, potentially signaling Russia&#x2019;s efforts to protect its warplanes amid increasing Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases. The jets had not been seen in Belarus since April 2023. However, on Oct. 10, a MiG-31 aircraft, capable of carrying Kinzhal ballistic missiles, landed at Belarus&apos; Machulishchy airfield, followed by a second jet, according to the Belarusian Hajun monitoring group. The last recorded movement of the jets was at 3:10 p.m. local time on Oct. 10, when both planes took off from the airfield. Their current location is unknown, though they may still be in Belarus, the group told the Kyiv Independent. The unexpected arrival has prompted speculation from Ukrainian officials and military experts. One possible reason for moving the jets to Belarus is that Russia is trying to protect them after successful Ukrainian strikes on Russian airfields, said Peter Layton, associate fellow at RUSI, visiting fellow at Griffith Asia Institute, and former Australian Air Force officer. &quot;There are only a limited number of MiG-31s &#x2013; keeping them safe is important,&quot; Layton told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The MiG-31s can be based in Belarus, and then fly into Russian airspace to launch their weapons, and later return to Belarus, where they are considered safer.&quot; At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly had 12 MiG-31s in service. However, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia&#x2019;s Savasleyka airbase on Aug. 16 destroyed at least one MiG-31 and possibly damaged another, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. Two other attacks also targeted MiG-31s, including a strike on Savasleyka on Aug. 13 that damaged a jet, and attacks on May 15 at the Belbek airfield in occupied Crimea that damaged or destroyed two MiG-31s. Russian MiG-31BM fighters fly over Red Square in Moscow, Russia, on May 7, 2019, during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade. (Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Despite these losses, Russia can still replenish its fleet, said Bohdan Dolintse, head of the Institute of Management and Strategies, though repairing the damaged aircraft could take up to a year. The jets can fly at speeds of up to 3,000 kilometers per hour and launch Kinzhal missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers, putting all of Ukraine at risk. Stationing them in Belarus also places them closer to the front lines, expanding their combat range, Layton noted. The Belarusian Hajun Group suggested the MiG-31s could be undergoing system checks in Belarus or conducting tests with the Belarusian Air Force. Another possibility is that Russia is preparing for a major attack on Ukraine, similar to the Aug. 26 mass strikes that devastated Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, said retired Ukrainian Armed Forces Major Oleksii Hetman. With much of Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense unable to intercept Kinzhals, air raid alerts are triggered across the country whenever a MiG-31 takes off. Only Patriot and SAMP/T air defense systems are capable of downing the missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned the UN Security Council on Sept. 25 that Russia is preparing an attack on three nuclear power plants as part of a strategy to dismantle Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid before winter. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, believes Russia could also be planning a provocation against Belarus to blame Ukraine.

Oil depot burning in occupied Luhansk Oblast after Ukrainian strike, General Staff says	Ukraine hit a Russian fuel depot in occupied Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 12. Ukrainian troops in cooperation with the intelligence service (HUR) struck a depot containing oil and petroleum products used by the Russian military near the town of Rovenky, Luhansk Oblast. The attack set the depot ablaze and Ukraine is assessing the damage. It is not the first time the depot has been hit and Ukraine has increased drone attacks on oil infrastructure in Russia and the occupied territories this year. The attacks are designed to burn fuel to hinder the Russian army as well as weaken Russia&#x2019;s economy, which relies on oil exports. The fires can rage for days in some cases. On Oct. 7, Ukrainian drones targeted the largest oil depot in occupied Crimea, the Marine Oil Terminal, causing a fire that burned for four days and forced over a thousand people to evacuate. On Oct. 10, two more explosions erupted at the Marine Oil Terminal, although Ukraine did not confirm if this was another attack. Another depot fire near a town in Russia&#x2019;s Rostov Oblast in August took two weeks to extinguish and injured 49 Russian firefighters. Ukraine began its campaign against Russian oil assets in March and has hit at least 33 assets, some as deep as 1,500 kilometers into Russian territory. Despite the impressive show of burning refineries and depots, the attacks are unlikely to collapse Russia&#x2019;s oil sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-oil-depot-burning-in-occupied-luhansk-oblast-after-ukrainian-strike/	2024-10-12T02:32:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screen-Shot-2024-10-12-at-12_15_08.png
Russian attacks kill 3, injure at least 14 people in Ukraine over past day	Russia carried out mass attacks across Ukraine&#x2019;s southern and eastern regions killing at least three civilians and wounding 14 in the last 24 hours, Ukrainian officials reported on Oct. 12. In Donestk Oblast, Russian troops launched strikes on the village of Bohoiavlenka, near the recently fallen town of Vuhledar, killing two civilians, reported the Donest Oblast Military Administration. Russian forces also struck the village of Ivanopillia, close to the ongoing battle around Chasiv Yar, killing one civilian. In total, eight people were injured. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces launched 425 strikes across 11 localities on Oct. 11, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Military Administration Head Ivan Fedorov. Overnight attacks on the city of Zaporizhzhia hit residential buildings and businesses, injuring three people including a young girl. In Kherson Oblast, shelling injured three people and damaged houses, infrastructure, and businesses, according to Kherson City Military Administration Head Roman Marchenko. A huge fire broke out overnight after shelling at a warehouse and waste production storage site in the city of Kherson, which firefighters managed to extinguish by the morning of Oct. 12, Ukraine&#x2019;s emergency services reported. Russian troops are advancing in Donetsk Oblast as they attempt to capture more towns before the freezing winter weather sets in. Fierce fighting is taking place in Toretsk and the town could be the next one to fall to Russian occupation. However, Ukrainian troops have stabilized the front line near Prokovsk after Russian forces increased attacks on the town in recent months. Russian troops are currently less than 10 kilometers from the town.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kills-and-injures-multiple-civilians-in-attacks-on-south-and-east-ukraine-in-the-past-day/	2024-10-12T01:41:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/a0f17272-79e1-42ac-b13a-5430508830df.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 667,630 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 667,630 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 12. This number includes 1,290 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,962 tanks, 17,827 armored fighting vehicles, 26,513 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,381 artillery systems, 1,230 multiple launch rocket systems, 976 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 16,947 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-667-630-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-11T23:17:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1722874070.jpg
Poland’s 2025 EU presidency to focus on Ukraine’s integration and EU expansion, Duda says	Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that a key priority of Poland&apos;s EU presidency in early 2025 will be the European integration of Ukraine and maintaining an &quot;open door to Europe&quot; policy for new members. During the Arraiolos Group summit in Krakow, an annual informal gathering of presidents from parliamentary and semi-presidential EU member states, leaders discussed these issues. &quot;The question of how to act so that Ukraine not only survives the terrible aggression of Russia, which it is currently facing, but also how to act so that Ukraine is accepted into the EU as soon as possible, was raised repeatedly,&quot; Duda said. The discussions also focused on strengthening EU-U.S. ties, rebuilding Ukraine after the war, and ensuring energy security in the EU. Other leaders, including Estonia&apos;s president, echoed the call for supporting Ukraine and pushing for EU expansion to include Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans. The European bloc granted candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova in June 2022, and EU leaders agreed last December to open accession talks with the two aspiring members. Poland will chair the EU Council between January and June 2025, taking over the six-month presidency of Hungary. The Hungarian prime minister and his top diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, have repeatedly frustrated their European colleagues by obstructing assistance for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, claiming that arming Kyiv will lead to &quot;escalation&quot; and prolongation of the war. Orban has become something of a black sheep in the EU, regularly lashing out against &quot;Brussels bureaucrats&quot; while drawing criticism about the domestic rule of law issues and democratic backsliding.	https://kyivindependent.com/polands-2025-eu-presidency-to-focus-on-ukraines-integration-and-eu-expansion-duda-says/	2024-10-11T20:09:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2160567078.jpg
EU officials considering reform to bypass Hungary’s blockade on Ukraine defense funds	A proposed reform of the European Peace Facility (EPF) would make financial contributions voluntary, aiming to bypass Hungary&apos;s veto on military aid to Ukraine, which has caused a 6.5 billion euro ($7 billion) backlog. Hungary, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-proximate EU member, has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine on account that it &quot;prolongs&quot; and &quot;escalates&quot; the ongoing war. These views have been often echoed in Slovakia since Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico took office last fall. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also said on July 23 that Ukrainian military aid will be blocked until Kyiv allows the transit of Russia&apos;s Lukoil oil. &quot;I made it clear that as long as Ukraine fails to resolve the issue, everyone can forget about the 6.5 billion euros in compensation for arms transfers under the European Peace Facility,&quot; Szijjarto said in an interview with the ATV news channel. The reform plan is in its early stages, and would allow countries like Hungary to opt out of contributing, relieving tensions caused by Hungary&apos;s opposition to EU military support for Ukraine. However, the move could weaken the EU&apos;s united front against Russia and raise budgetary concerns among member states. Though some EU leaders remain hopeful that Hungary will lift its veto, the ongoing friction between Hungary&apos;s positions and the majority of EU member decisions leaves the future of the EPF uncertain.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-officials-considering-reform-to-bypass-hungarys-blockade-on-ukraine-defense-funds/	2024-10-11T19:02:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176886229.jpg
NATO to rethink alliance's relationship with Russia for first time in decades	NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels this month will discuss the future of the alliance&apos;s relationship with Russia, potentially upending decades of foreign policy, Politico reported on Oct. 11, citing a senior U.S. official. Relations between NATO and Russia deteriorated sharply following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Despite increased tensions, the NATO-Russia Founding Act, signed in 1997, remains in effect. The act outlines a mutual aim to &quot;build a stable, peaceful and undivided Europe.&quot; NATO states are now looking to redefine the alliance&apos;s future relationship with Moscow. Defense ministers from member nations will convene in Brussels Oct. 17-18 to discuss the matter, a senior U.S. government official said. Allies will &quot;map out different elements of (the Russia) strategy and advance the debates inside the alliance that takes us to subjects like the future of the NATO-Russia Founding Act,&quot; a senior U.S. government official told reporters on Friday. &quot;It&apos;s time to now craft a new strategy in terms of (the allies&apos;) specific positions,&quot; the official said. The October meeting represents the first time official talks on the topic have been held at the ministerial level. At the next NATO summit, which will take place in The Hague in June 2025, allies have agreed to draft a new NATO-Russia strategy. &quot;Right now we have to have an understanding across the alliance ... that the (Founding Act) and the NATO-Russia Council were built for a different era, and I think the allies are prepared to say that was a different era in our relationship with Russia, and therefore something new is merited,&quot; the official said. The NATO-Russia Council (NRC) was established in 2002 to facilitate cooperation and joint decision-making. The NRC has not met since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. While warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since the all-out war began, most analysts and commentators suggest such a scenario is not imminent. The U.S. official said the military implications of the revised political strategy are expected to be minimal. Another NATO diplomat also expressed concern that too aggressive a strategy could send a disruptive &quot;signal&quot; to Moscow. Currently, the focus is on gathering viewpoints across member states, the official said. There is no draft document of a revised NATO-Russia strategy at this time. At the beginning of October, Mark Rutte took &#xA0;the helm as NATO&apos;S new secretary general, stressing on his first day that the alliance has to ensure that Ukraine &quot;prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-rethink-alliances-relationship-with-russia-for-first-time-in-decades/	2024-10-11T15:10:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1068300926.jpeg
House Speaker has no 'appetite' for more US support for Ukraine	U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Oct. 11 that he no longer has &quot;an appetite for further Ukraine funding&quot; and hopes that a November electoral victory for former U.S. President Donald Trump will bring a swift end to the war. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has served as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since October 2023. He helped delay aid to Kyiv last fall by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill, but eventually reached a deal to pass the bill. &quot;I don&apos;t have an appetite for further Ukraine funding, and I hope it&apos;s not necessary,&quot; Johnson said on Oct. 11 in an interview with Punchbowl News. &quot;If President Trump wins, I believe that he actually can bring that conflict to a close. I really do. I think he&apos;ll call (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that this is enough.&quot; The U.S. presidential election, now less than a month away, holds high stakes for Ukraine. The candidates have diverged sharply on their stances toward ongoing support for Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he will end the full-scale war within 24 hours after being elected and has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for failing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia. He has also vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict if he wins in November. Vice President Kamala Harris has accused Trump of advocating a Ukrainian surrender and has said she would refuse to engage in any peace negotiations with Russia without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Johnson&apos;s remarks lend fuel to fears that a Trump victory would signal an end to U.S. military aid for Ukraine. In the interview, he suggested that the international community is also tired of continuing to support Ukraine&apos;s defense and that a Harris presidency would lead to an endless war. &quot;And I think everybody around the world is weary of this, and they want it to be resolved,&quot; he said. &quot;So whatever the terms are, I&apos;m not sure, but I think if Kamala Harris is president, I don&apos;t think it ends, and that&apos;s a desperate and dangerous scenario.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/house-speaker-has-no-appetite-for-more-us-support-for-ukraine/	2024-10-11T14:06:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147961265.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launches new push in Kursk Oblast, Kyiv claims attack 'thwarted'	Key developments on Oct. 11: Russian forces launched a new counterattack against Ukraine&apos;s left flank in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, several Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels claimed on Oct. 10. A Ukrainian official commented that the &quot;Russian plan in Kursk Oblast has been thwarted so far&quot; as Russian forces suffered losses. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. &quot;No details yet, but the Russian military suffered significant losses in equipment,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. Parallel messages also appeared on Russian pro-war channels. The well-known pro-war Rybar channel wrote that Russian forces launched several attacks in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, in which Ukraine established its foothold. &quot;The advanced groups of Russian troops reached Zeleny Shliakh by the end of the day, which allows us to claim at least a partial breakthrough in the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; defenses,&quot; Rybar claimed on Oct. 10. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry alleged late on Oct. 10 that its forces had &quot;penetrated&quot; into the Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast and inflicted losses on manpower and equipment. Later, on Oct. 11, DeepState reported that the situation in the area remains difficult, but Ukrainian forces are succeeding in stabilizing it. According to the channel, it was not yet possible to regain all the lost territory, but Russian forces suffered significant losses in the attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Ukraine controls roughly 40-50% of the town of Toretsk while the rest has been captured by Russia, the city&apos;s military administration head, Vasyl Chynchyk, said on Oct. 11. Toretsk, a town some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk, is one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast, where Russian troops are steadily pushing back Ukrainian defenders step by step. Speaking on air on national television, Chynchyk said that roughly 1,150 people remain in the ruined town. Roughly 70,000 residents lived in Toretsk before the full-scale invasion. &quot;We are making every effort to evacuate civilians... The security situation allows entering the town and evacuating the population only in certain periods when there is a lull in fighting or favorable weather conditions,&quot; the official said. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState indicates that settlements on the eastern outskirts of Toretsk &#x2013; Pivnichne, Zalizne, Druzhba, and Pivdenne &#x2013; are fully or almost completely in Russian hands. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Germany on Oct. 11, receiving new pledges of support from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelensky&apos;s visit is part of a broader European tour during which he hopes to ramp up support for Ukraine and its five-step victory plan. During a joint press conference, Scholz revealed that Germany had delivered a package of aid for Ukraine worth 600 million euros ($660 million). This included a fifth IRIS-T medium-range air defense system, armored vehicles, tanks, howitzers, ammunition, and drones. &quot;By the end of the year, with the support of partners &#x2014; Belgium, Denmark, Norway &#x2014; we will deliver another package worth 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to Ukraine,&quot; Scholz said. It will include IRIS-T, Skynex, and Gepard anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as artillery, armored vehicles, drones, radars, and ammunition. Separate boards were set up for the lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, a big step towards compliance with NATO standards, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a Facebook post on Oct. 11. &#x201C;We have finally established supervisory boards for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Non-lethal Defense Rear Agency (DOT),&#x201D; his post read. In a shake-up of ministry personnel earlier this month, Minister Rustem Umerov reshuffled the cards by requesting the dismissal of three of his deputies amid a debate with NATO over plans to unify military procurement into one agency. Umerov planned to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) into one agency but changed his mind after a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards should be established. This process of creating the supervisory boards concluded today, Umerov said in his Facebook post. The DPA, first established in August 2022, focuses solely on procuring lethal aid, while the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. Since the start of the week, Ukraine&apos;s forces have repelled 29 Russian attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Operational Command South said on Oct. 11. &quot;The defense forces of southern Ukraine in the Kherson Oblast repelled 29 assaults. During the past day, five assaults were recorded in the Kherson and two assaults in the Zaporizhzhia directions,&quot; the command said in a statement. Russia used 318 FPV drones, including 3 Lancet-type drones, and dropped 428 general-purpose bombs, Operational Command South said. Despite ongoing assaults, no gains were made. The statement aligns with an earlier warning of Ukraine&apos;s forces that Russia will aim for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the coming days. The new Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Kyiv announced the withdrawal from Vuhledar on Oct. 2, after Russian forces first swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and then entered its urban area.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launched-new-push-in-kursk-oblast-kyiv-claims-attack-thwarted/	2024-10-11T13:25:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166251077.jpg
Conscription officers detain men outside Okean Elzy concert in Kyiv	Conscription officers checked documents and detained some male concertgoers outside Kyiv&apos;s Palace of Sports on Oct. 11 during a performance by Okean Elzy, a popular Ukrainian rock band, the news outlet Hromadske reported. Ukraine has made efforts to ramp up mobilization this year, with President Volodymyr Zelensky signing a new law on mobilization on April 16. The law stipulates that those eligible for military service must maintain updated data and documentation. &#xA0; Video footage taken at the scene by Hromadske correspondents shows officers stationed outside the doors to the venue, intercepting male attendees as they exited the concert. In the video, officers are forcibly arresting some men. Police reportedly checked the military registration documents of the men as they left the venue. Those who had problems with their documentation were either arrested, or released after being issued summonses. Officers reportedly prevented one woman from entering a patrol car to accompany her husband after he was detained. Under Ukraine&apos;s new mobilization law, men who do not properly update their military documents can be fined or placed on a wanted list. The law also introduces harsher penalties for draft evasion. The methods of some enlistment offices have come under scrutiny for aggressive tactics. There have been multiple cases of suspected abuses committed by enlistment officials toward civilians and conscripts since the launch of large-scale mobilization.	https://kyivindependent.com/conscription-officers-detain-men-outside-okean-elzy-concert-in-kyiv/	2024-10-11T13:14:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176545804.jpg
Hungary's oil company MOL faces delays in project weaning its refineries off Russian crude	Hungary&apos;s oil and gas giant MOL faces a one-year delay in its $500 million investment project to diversify its refineries from Russian crude oil, Reuters reported on Oct. 10. According to the new estimates, MOL, which owns refineries in Hungary and Slovakia, will be able to process non-Urals oil by the end of 2026, as opposed to their earlier estimates of early 2026. &quot;There are investments underway that we could increase this to 100% by the end of 2026,&quot; Viktor Sverla, MOL&apos;s vice president, was quoted as saying. MOL&apos;s refineries are fed by the southern spur of the Druzhba pipeline coming from Russia, as landlocked Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic received a temporary exemption from the EU&apos;s embargo on Russian crude in 2022. Mol&apos;s vice president reiterated the company&apos;s desire to keep Russia among its suppliers. &quot;However, the Druzhba pipeline is vital for us, and our aim is to have a diverse crude oil procurement that relies on both Russian and non-Russian oil,&quot; he said. Hungary also receives seaborne crude oil from Croatia&apos;s Adria pipeline, but disputes over the pipeline&apos;s capacity and the fee set by its operator, Janaf, incentivized MOL to keep importing oil from Russia. Ukraine has been long advocating for European countries to cut themselves from Russian oil as they help finance the Kremlin&apos;s war against Ukraine. In June, Kyiv imposed sanctions blocking Lukoil, one of the largest oil companies in Russia, from transiting crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline running through Ukrainian territory. Hungary and Slovakia were among the countries hardest hit by Kyiv&apos;s decision, although the two countries later managed to retain Russian suppliers by using intermediaries.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-oil-company-mol-faces-delays-in-project-weaning-its-refineries-off-from-russian-crude/	2024-10-11T12:16:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1237205627.jpg
Slovakia to expand its base of repairing Ukrainian military hardware, foreign minister says	Slovakia will expand its military base in Michalovce, repairing Ukrainian military equipment instead of supplying new weapons to Ukraine, Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blan&#xE1;r said on Oct. 11. Blan&#xE1;r stated that Slovakia will expand the facility as part of its aid to Ukraine, as they will no longer provide Ukraine with military equipment from its stockpiles, given that, according to him, there is nothing left to offer. Later, he added that the investment would be financed by Germany, and Slovakia would contribute the physical premises. The repair facility, situated within the Slovak army&apos;s military quarter in Michalovce, began operations at the end of 2022. Blan&#xE1;r&apos;s announcement came during his first official visit to Germany, where he met his counterpart and discussed Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, migration, and mutual relations. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, a populist, said his country would halt military aid to Ukraine after he took office in September 2023. The move was a stark reversal of Slovak foreign policy. On Oct. 7, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal met with Fico in the Ukrainian border city of Uzhhorod. The meeting came shortly after Fico said that as long as he is prime minister, he will block Kyiv&apos;s entry into NATO. &quot;This is something that I have openly told Prime Minister Shmyhal, the Americans, and everyone else. As long as I am head of the Slovak government, I will direct the lawmakers under my control as chairman of the (ruling Smer) party never to agree to Ukraine joining NATO,&quot; Fico told Slovak media.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-to-expand-its-base-of-repairing-ukrainian-military-hardware-foreign-minister-says/	2024-10-11T11:51:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-07_16-06-45.jpg
Why the Baltic States fear Russia's Kaliningrad exclave	Lithuania announced this week it had blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman River linking it to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, the latest in a series of escalations in the Baltic Sea region. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine exacerbated fears of a potential open conflict between Moscow and NATO, with Lithuania, bordering Russia&apos;s ally Belarus and Kaliningrad Oblast, finding itself one of the first countries threatened by such a clash. A picture released by Lithuania&apos;s Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas on Oct. 9 showed his country is taking the threat seriously. The bridge in question is now covered in &quot;dragon&apos;s teeth.&quot; He said other bridges leading to Kaliningrad would also be fortified, and some may even be mined. The announcement came days after an incident on the Kaliningrad-Moscow railway line. One carriage of a train arrived at the Kena checkpoint at the Lithuanian-Belarusian borders displaying the letter Z, a symbol commonly used by Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Another had been defaced with an inscription describing Vilnius, Lithuania&apos;s capital, a &quot;Russian city.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s understandable that the Lithuanian government is worried about this,&quot; Dr Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, told the Kyiv Independent. Lithuania announced this week that it had blocked and reinforced a bridge over the Nieman River, connecting it to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, using dragon&apos;s teeth barriers. (Laurynas Kasciuna)&quot;The Baltics have a long history of being occupied by other foreign forces, particularly Russia, and a relatively short history of being independent.&quot; He adds that while he &quot;doesn&apos;t expect to see Russian tanks in Riga or Tallinn, or Vilnius anytime soon,&quot; Lithuania and the other Baltic States are right to be concerned about what Russia is up to in the exclave right on their doorstep. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small piece of land measuring 15,100 square kilometers &#x2014; not much larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut &#x2014; sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. It has a short, western coastline on the Baltic Sea. Its capital is also called Kaliningrad. Though it may be small, strategically it gives Russia a second point of direct access to the Baltic Sea, the other being through its most eastern arm in the Finnish Gulf. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base in Kaliningrad Oblast. The headquarters of the Russian Admiralty is based in St. Petersburg, also located on the Baltic Sea. &quot;Kaliningrad is basically a military base with a city in the middle,&quot; Dr Hall said, adding: &quot;You have quite a few ships there, and what is necessary to defend those ships.&quot; A December 2023 report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said the exclave was home to a &quot;formidable&quot; arsenal of weapons that includes &quot;cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and nuclear weapons.&quot; But Lithuania&apos;s blocking of bridges suggests the country fears not only the threat posed by missiles, but that of an actual land invasion itself. The map shows the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)According to Dr Hall, the focus of not just Lithuania&apos;s, but also Latvia and Estonia&apos;s fears, is a narrow piece of land called the Suwalki Gap. The Suwalki Gap is the closest point between Kaliningrad Oblast, and one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies, Belarus. It&apos;s a mere 40 kilometers wide and closely tracks the Poland-Lithuania border on the Polish side. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic States. &quot;And that has been something that since the 1990s, the Russian army has trained for,&quot; Dr Hall said. He adds that while the recent NATO memberships of Finland and Sweden will likely have changed NATO planning for such an event, for a long time &quot;the idea among NATO members was that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were going to have to accept Russian occupation &#x2014; hopefully only for a little while &#x2014; as NATO forced its way back up the Baltic peninsula.&quot; And it&apos;s not just the Baltic States raising the alarm about Russian intentions in the region. In May, NATO&apos;s newest member, Sweden, issued an ominous warning with Micael Byden, the supreme commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin may be seeking dominance over the Baltic Sea and has his eye on the Swedish island of Gotland. Located around 330 kilometers (around 200 miles) north of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, Gotland is Sweden&apos;s largest island. Its central location means it is of vital strategic importance in the Baltic Sea. &quot;Who controls Gotland controls the Baltic Sea,&quot; said Byden. While warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, most analysts and commentators suggest such a scenario is not imminent.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Germany&apos;s military has drawn up plans for &quot;a conventional attack by Russia within five years,&quot; In January, a top NATO official gave a timescale of &quot;the next 20 years.&quot; And with Russian forces committed in Ukraine and Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Lithuania&apos;s blocking of bridges to prevent a Russian ground attack could come across as premature. But according to Dr. Jan Kallberg, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, Washington D.C., and a fellow at the Army Cyber Institute at West Point, seeing Lithuania&apos;s actions in such a way misses the point. &quot;The Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, and Poles are under constant intimidation from the Russian supremacist regime seeking to project that these countries, or parts of their countries, in a Russian mindset are provinces that have rebelled and need to be forced back into Russia,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania along with other Baltic countries in World War II, with the nation declaring independence only in 1990. &quot;Mining and blocking border bridges is a way to signal that you are not intimidated and ready to fight for your freedom,&quot; Kallberg adds. Dr Hall agrees, suggesting the U.S. and other European countries could have benefitted from taking a similar stance both before and during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s better to be proactive and send a strong signal now in the hope that Russia will see that signal and decide it&apos;s not worth it, something I think Western states have failed to do continuously regarding Putin,&quot; he said. And even if a Russian invasion of NATO territory is years away, Kaliningrad plays a crucial role in Russia&apos;s ongoing efforts to destabilize the region. Moscow has been ratcheting up tensions in the Baltic Sea, with GPS jamming, disappearing buoys, and an aborted &quot;ocean-grab&quot; just some of the events this year that have raised concerns about the Kremlin&apos;s intentions in the region. Incidents of jamming the GPS systems aboard commercial aircraft over the Baltic Sea region have soared in recent months. While it&apos;s almost impossible to prove who is responsible definitively, a jammer blocks a signal from the point where it is deployed up to a distance of 350 kilometers for some military-grade models. With NATO countries highly unlikely to be engaging in self-sabotage, Russia is the main suspect, and a jammer located in Kaliningrad would give them the range required to disrupt flights in the region. With an ongoing Russian hybrid war against the West and the looming possibility of a direct clash with NATO on the horizon, the situation with Kaliningrad and its Western neighbors appears to be only headed in one direction. &quot;In the long run, we might see a development of these Baltic and Polish borders to Russia and Belarus similar to the Korean 38th parallel between South Korea and North Korea,&quot; Kallberg said. &quot;A militarized border that is a never-ending propaganda battle using all forms of intimidation and propaganda measures, and on and off, and even open aggression.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-the-baltic-states-fear-russias-kaliningrad-exclave/	2024-10-11T11:36:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242772267.jpg
Woodward revelations deepen debate on whether Trump will sell out Ukraine to Kremlin	As the Nov. 5 presidential election in the U.S. approaches, debate is intensifying over whether one of the two potential winners, Donald Trump, will act in the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although discussions on the topic have raged since Trump&#x2019;s first presidency, they accelerated this week after fresh revelations in U.S. journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, &#x201C;War,&#x201D; were cited by U.S. media. The book will hit bookshelves next week. Trump has spoken with Putin seven times since leaving office in 2021, according to an unnamed aide cited by Woodward. The book also claims Trump secretly sent Abbott Covid testing machines to Putin during his first term as president when the devices were scarce. If true, the new information exposes a deeper side of the controversial relationship between Trump and Putin, prompting critics of the ex-president seeking re-election this autumn to accuse him of selling out both U.S. and Ukrainian interests to the Kremlin. The revelations fit in with Trump&apos;s track record of praising Putin and seeking a friendlier relationship with Russia. Analysts say that Trump likes Putin because he views himself along with the Russian leader as &quot;strongmen.&quot; But other facts in Trump&apos;s previous relations with Putin may indicate that a &quot;sellout&quot; of U.S. and Ukrainian interests is not inevitable. During Trump&#x2019;s presidency from 2017 to 2021, the U.S. began supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine, and killed Russian mercenaries in Syria.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s election campaign has slammed the book&#x2019;s claims, saying in a statement that &#x201C;none of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true,&#x201D; accusing Woodward of bias. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Covid tests had been sent, but denied the book&#x2019;s claim that Trump and Putin had spoken by phone several times since the U.S. politician left office. &#x201C;We also sent equipment at the beginning of the pandemic,&#x201D; Peskov said, adding: &#x201C;But about the phone calls &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not true.&#x201D; &quot;Surprise Surprise! Isn&apos;t that special! Our erstwhile ex-president BFF with the dictator and warmonger Vladimir Putin,&quot; Reno Domenico, head of Democrats Abroad in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This falls somewhere between fraternizing with the enemy and being a Kremlin agent. Do you think the subject of Ukraine&apos;s surrender came up during the phone calls?&quot; Adrian Karatnycky, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center, said that Woodward&apos;s revelations are &quot;a remarkable indication of long-standing and ongoing links between Putin and Trump.&quot; &quot;The secrecy around this is as important as the potential content of their discussions,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It has been reported that some of these discussions occurred well after genocidal attacks on Ukraine, and well after it was clear that Putin was indicted as a war criminal. They occurred as late as 2024.&quot; Karatnycky argued that &quot;we have all known and suspected that there is a &apos;special relationship&apos; between Trump and Putin but these ongoing discussions and some things Trump has been saying about a quick solution (to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine) leads one to the conclusion that they may have had preliminary discussions about what I would call a sellout of Ukraine.&quot; US President Donald Trump (Center L) and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (Center R) arrive for a meeting at Finland&apos;s Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland on July 16, 2018. (Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)Speculation looms, even in Kyiv, on how reliable the new information presented by Woodward is. Woodward&apos;s report was based on only one source, and no other sources have confirmed it. Twenty current and former Trump and Biden administration officials and career intelligence officials reached by The New York Times said they had no knowledge of any contacts between Trump and Putin in the years since Trump left office. Although Woodward conducted 20 interviews with Trump from 2016 to 2020 for his previous books, the Trump campaign said he was not given any access for &#x201C;War.&#x201D; &quot;The main question is the source,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Where did he take this information? It&apos;s just a rumor.&quot; Fesenko, a regular talking head on Ukrainian state television which is controlled by President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s administration during martial law, added that Woodward was not a neutral source since he had consistently supported the Democrats. He added, however, that there is no doubt that Trump has a soft spot for Putin, and &quot;this has been known for a long time.&quot; &quot;Trump sympathizes with strong leaders,&quot; he said. &quot;He is susceptible to flattery, and Putin takes advantage of this.&quot; Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin said that &quot;Putin and Trump are cut from the same political cloth.&quot; &quot;They are authoritarian leaders, strongmen,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Trump and Putin are two of a kind; they understand each other instinctively. For Putin, it&apos;s more convenient to negotiate with Trump (than with Biden or Harris),&quot; he added. His comment refers to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, and his Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party candidate squaring off with Trump for the presidency in the upcoming election. Trump has repeatedly backed and praised Putin and rarely criticized him. In 2018 Trump accepted Putin&#x2019;s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump also described Putin&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine as &#x201C;genius&#x201D; and &#x201C;savvy&#x201D; in 2022. Additionally, there are well-documented links between Trump&apos;s team and the Kremlin. In 2015 Trump&apos;s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was paid $45,000 to deliver a Moscow speech at an anniversary celebration of RT, a Kremlin-controlled TV network, where he sat next to Putin at his banquet table. Flynn also repeatedly met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In 2017, Flynn reached a deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to plead guilty to a felony count of making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigations about his contacts with Kislyak. The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in 2020 that Trump&apos;s former campaign manager Paul Manafort &quot;represented a grave counterintelligence threat&quot; by creating opportunities for &quot;Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on the Trump campaign.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) looks at U.S. President Donald Trump during the welcoming ceremony before the G20 Summit&apos;s Plenary Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Nov. 30, 2018. (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)During Trump&apos;s presidency, the directors of Russia&apos;s three main intelligence and security agencies (FSB, SVR, and GRU) also paid an unusual visit to Washington D.C. and met with top U.S. security officials. Two of them were on the U.S. sanctions list. The Mueller special counsel investigation concluded in 2019 that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor Trump. However, the investigation found no evidence that Trump or any of his aides coordinated with the Russian government&#x2019;s 2016 election interference. In the run-up to this autumn&#x2019;s presidential election, Trump has faced accusations that he was willing to push Ukraine to conclude a peace deal with Russia on Putin&#x2019;s terms. He said in 2023 that, if elected president again, he would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin to make a peace deal, ending Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Trump also said he would warn Putin that the U.S. would increase military support for Ukraine if an agreement is not reached. But two Trump advisors have proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia instead of continuing to push back in an existential war, Reuters reported in June. Despite the Trump team&apos;s alleged links with the Kremlin, some observers, including Fesenko, argue that U.S.-Russian relations deteriorated during Trump&apos;s presidency from 2017 through 2021. Fesenko said that &quot;Trump sincerely wanted to reach a deal with Putin&quot; and improve relations between the two countries, but &quot;Putin didn&apos;t make any concessions to Trump.&quot; He also pointed to the Trump administration&apos;s 2017 decision to start supplying lethal weapons, namely Javelin anti-tank missiles, to Ukraine as a sign of worsening relations with the Kremlin. Despite the supply of Javelins, in 2019 Trump withheld military aid and an invitation to the White House from Zelensky in order to influence Ukraine to announce an investigation into Trump&apos;s political opponent Joe Biden and to promote the conspiracy theory that Ukraine was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to a Congressional inquiry. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for these actions but acquitted by the Senate. Trump&apos;s supporters in Congress also blocked $61 billion U.S. military aid from October 2023 until April 2024.

(Kaniuka Ruslan / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Domenico dismissed the argument that Trump&apos;s relations with Putin deteriorated. &quot;The story about Javelins is the only thing they can point to,&quot; he said. &quot;And the Javelins only came because Trump was caught in the impeachment scandal at the time, and had to act like he was doing something.&quot; He added that &quot;when the ambassador and (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov were in the White House in January 2017, laughing and joking, everything looked hunky-dory to me between Russia and Donald Trump.&quot; Another low in U.S.-Russian relations came in 2018, when the U.S. and their allies killed dozens of Syrian troops, and an unknown number of Russian Wagner Group mercenaries in the Battle of Hasham in Syria. In 2018, Trump even went so far as to directly criticize Putin, saying he was responsible for his ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad&#x2019;s chemical attacks. &#x201C;President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad,&#x201D; he said. Under Trump, the U.S. government also imposed sanctions against Russian companies and the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. The U.S. also expelled sixty Russian diplomats following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in the U.K. in 2018. The U.K. government accused the Kremlin of organizing the assassination attempt.	https://kyivindependent.com/woodward-revelations-deepen-debate-on-whether-trump-will-sell-out-ukraine-to-kremlin/	2024-10-11T11:12:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Germany delivers IRIS-T air defense system, Zelensky says next year's support is key	President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Germany for its support but highlighted the importance of German assistance next year and the need for it to remain unchanged. Zelensky&apos;s third meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz this fall was part of a broader European tour during which he aimed to ramp up support for Ukraine and its five-step victory plan. &quot;Thank you for helping Ukraine&#x2026; It is essential for us that next year&apos;s assistance does not decrease and that the amount of assistance is sufficient to protect people and lives,&quot; Zelensky said. During a joint press conference, Scholz revealed that Germany had delivered an aid package for Ukraine worth 600 million euros ($660 million). This included a fifth IRIS-T medium-range air defense system, armored vehicles, tanks, howitzers, ammunition, and drones. &quot;By the end of the year, with the support of partners &#x2014; Belgium, Denmark, Norway &#x2014; we will deliver another package worth 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to Ukraine,&quot; Scholz said. It will include IRIS-T, Skynex, and Gepard anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as artillery, armored vehicles, drones, radars, and ammunition. Zelensky&apos;s visit to Germany follows his trips to the U.K., France, and Italy, where he met leaders of the respective countries to present them with Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan. Ukraine&apos;s head of state hopes to rally support for the proposal, which Kyiv describes as a path toward just and lasting peace. The situation grows ever more dire for the besieged country as Russian forces keep pressing on in the east, and the population faces energy deficits in the coming winter. In the meantime, the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House prompts fears of weakened U.S. support.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-delivers-iris-t-air-defense-system-zelensky-says-next-year-support-is-key/	2024-10-11T11:10:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177153600.jpg

EU demands investigation of Roshchyna's death, condemns 'abuses against journalists'	The European Union was &quot;appalled&quot; by Victoria Roshchyna&apos;s death and demanded a &quot;thorough and independent&quot; investigation into the circumstances of her death, its External Service&apos;s spokesperson said in a statement on Oct. 11. &quot;The EU demands a thorough and independent investigation that clarifies all the circumstances of Victoria Roshchyna&apos;s death as soon as possible,&quot; the statement read. According to the statement, Roshchyna died while being transferred to Moscow from a prison in Taganrog. Roshchyna was suspected to be held in Russian detention centers where torture is used against prisoners, the Media Initiative for Human Rights said earlier on Oct. 11. She was the thirteenth journalist to be killed since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the statement added. &quot;There can be no impunity for human rights violations and abuses against journalists,&quot; the statement added. Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist, was reported to be dead on Oct.10 after being held in Russian captivity following her disappearance in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory. Roshchyna had covered Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for multiple Ukrainian news outlets, including Hromadske, Ukrainska Pravda, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). In March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-demands-investigation-of-roshchynas-death-condemns-abuses-against-journalists/	2024-10-11T10:18:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/462591702_10164204663496754_1105473934748675527_n.jpg
Ukraine braces for winter freeze amid potential Russian strikes targeting nuclear power	Ukraine is set to face its toughest winter since the start of the full-scale invasion as Russia eyes cutting off its nuclear power after already bombing out capacity from half of its electricity generation sector in large-scale air strikes. For now, Russia is not directly striking the plants with missiles and kamikaze drones. But Moscow has increasingly targeted nearby infrastructure, such as substations containing crucial equipment like transformers and power lines connecting nuclear plants to the grid. &#x201C;We&apos;re in a world where (Ukraine) has a deficit of functioning infrastructure. This is going to be the hardest winter yet,&#x201D; International Energy Agency (IEA) Chief Economist Tim Gould told the Kyiv Independent. If Russian attacks successfully disconnect all the power plants from the grid, then Ukraine&#x2019;s only stable power source is gone, said Warsaw-based energy analyst Wojciech Jakobik. &#x201C;(Nuclear power) is a baseload capacity, which is irreplaceable by renewables, other sources, and especially not by energy imports,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;With a smaller nuclear capacity in place, Ukraine will have less flexibility and less ability to stabilize (energy) generation.&#x201D; Ukraine has lost 9 gigawatts of power generation, including eight thermal plants and five hydro plants, due to Russian strikes this year. While companies scramble to repair their damaged assets, Russia is gearing up to attack Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear infrastructure, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office told the Kyiv Independent, which would freeze out Ukrainians and cause a humanitarian crisis if the country can&#x2019;t swiftly repair and protect its infrastructure. An infographic showing the locations of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear capacity. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)After the occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in 2022, Ukraine relies heavily on three nuclear plants remaining under government control. They are the lifeline of the country, providing 60% of its power. The last mass attack on Aug. 26 forced Ukraine to disconnect three units at the Rivne and South Ukraine plants, causing weeks of power outages. The country&#x2019;s state-owned nuclear company, Energoatom, told the Kyiv Independent that all its power units are ready to operate at &#x201C;maximum capacity&#x201D; during the heating season, and the company connected a refurbished one-gigawatt nuclear power unit to the grid on Oct. 1. However, it has only recently announced plans to build additional fortifications to protect power plants from attacks. Without stable power, Ukrainians will face another round of blackouts similar to the ones in the summer which could last as long as eight hours a day, according to Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group. Brutally cold winter temperatures during power outages will freeze pipes, cutting off Ukrainians&#x2019; access to water and heating, and may lead to another wave of refugees, the UN&#x2019;s refugee agency (UNHCR) told the Kyiv Independent. At the same time, attacks on nuclear infrastructure massively heighten the risks of accidents, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office said. While Jakobik believes a Chernobyl-like scenario is unlikely as reactors are well protected, damage to substations could prevent backup supplies of electricity that ensure the safety of reactors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The EU and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv both told the Kyiv Independent that they are pitching in to bolster the energy sector in time for winter with financial support, backup equipment, and humanitarian aid. But with Russia relentlessly churning out and firing its missiles and drones, the only tangible tool for energy security is stronger air defense, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office said. During the first years of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine relied on different facilities within its massive energy sector to survive the initial attacks on energy infrastructure and even managed to export electricity to the EU. But that changed this year after mass attacks beginning in March wiped out 50% of its energy assets.Now, Ukraine has run out of options and switched from exporting to importing 2 gigawatts of electricity from its European neighbors. Winter power outages appear inevitable. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission (UNHRMM) expects blackouts to last between 4-18 hours a day, depending on attacks and the weather, causing living conditions to crumble for millions of citizens. &#x201C;The deficit of electricity supply could be up to 6 gigawatts. That&apos;s the equivalent of peak demand in Denmark,&#x201D; Gould said. With nuclear power as the remaining foundation for Ukraine&#x2019;s energy stability, it is the prime target for Russian strikes, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office said. Ukraine&#x2019;s government seeks to decentralize the power grid as quickly as possible, but this is unlikely to happen by the winter and private energy companies are desperately restoring their assets to strengthen the grid. Employees work in the control room of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Pivdennoukrainsk in Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 7, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Ukraine hopes to recover 3 gigawatts by the end of the year, said Olena Lapenko, general manager in the Field of Security and Resilience at DiXi Group. But this depends on critical funding, which state electricity grid operator Ukrenergo puts at $1.5 billion for rapid repairs this season. So far, Ukraine has received nearly 700 million euros ($766 million) from its energy support fund in cooperation with the European Commission, and winter is fast approaching. Part of the fund covers much-needed equipment, such as autotransformers, to patch up facilities damaged by Russian air strikes as fast as possible. Simple repairs around nuclear plants, like power lines, can be fixed within 24 hours, said Jakobik. But specialized equipment depends on deliveries from Western allies, which can take months unless there are readily available stockpiles, he said. &#x201C;The tough part is, you replace the old infrastructure with new parts and Russia attacks it once again,&#x201D; he added.DTEK, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company owned by its richest man Rinat Akhmetov, has lost 90% of its thermal plants capacity to Russian attacks. By winter, the company hopes to restore 60-65% of its thermal power that was damaged in spring. But even this would not be enough to replace nuclear power if all the plants are disconnected, said Oleksiy Povolotskiy, DTEK&#x2019;s head of Recovery Office.Another issue, said Povolotskiy, is that the war has bitten a chunk out of Ukraine&#x2019;s manual workforce while the scale of the damage is massive. DTEK is bringing in workers from other enterprises, like miners, to help clear debris. The company has asked European states to send engineers and machinery for more complex repairs. The costs of Russian attacks are piling up for Ukraine. DTEK has already funneled $80 million into repairs from its own budget. Instead of relying on equipment that softens the fallout of attacks and power outages, Povolotskiy believes the most efficient solution is for Western allies to provide Ukraine with additional air-defense systems.&#x201C;Partners should understand that it is much cheaper and much more efficient to protect (energy facilities) than to repair,&#x201D; he said. The U.S. embassy in Ukraine told Kyiv Independent that the Defense Department will provide an additional Patriot battery and missiles but did not specify if this was directly for the protection of energy facilities. For now, this is the only confirmed delivery of an additional air defense battery, although Washington pledged a $2.6 billion aid package on Sept. 26 that includes munitions and support for air defense systems. With no other extra air-defense systems currently in the pipeline, Ukraine&#x2019;s government is building protective constructions for substations against falling debris and drones. However, not enough constructions have been built in time for winter and contractors have allegedly not been fully paid. &#x201C;More concrete constructions must be built as soon as possible,&#x201D; Povolotskiy said. Yuliia Kyian, an official at the Energy Ministry, told the Kyiv Independent during a discussion in Kyiv on Oct. 2, that the constructions are expensive and take time to build. They also cannot withstand ballistic missile strikes, she added. Energoatom has faced criticism. In September and October, the company signed contracts to construct a $12.3 million shield around the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant and a $14.4 million worth of protection around the South Ukraine plant in Mykolaiv Oblast. Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdog Nashi Groshi reported that the contracts were concluded only after President Volodymyr Zelensky told the UN Security Council that Russia was preparing an attack on the three operating nuclear plants. &#x201C;It is difficult to assess why this was not done earlier,&#x201D; said DiXi Group&#x2019;s Lapenko. &#xA0;&#x201C;Probably no one could imagine that the Russians would aim directly at the nuclear power sites as this is a serious threat to nuclear safety. But we can&#x2019;t exclude such a scenario.&#x201D; A fire at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on Aug. 11, 2024. (Screenshot / President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram)A nuclear disaster would threaten the whole of Europe, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office said, adding that the global community must unite to prevent a catastrophe. Kyiv has reached out to the UN&#x2019;s nuclear agency (IAEA) to place more observation missions around its power plants, but an agreement has not yet been reached. International observers will ensure that safety standards are enforced at the plants and combat disinformation, as Moscow frequently denies Ukraine&#x2019;s accusations of endangering nuclear safety, Jakobik said. Nevertheless, Russia could pummel nuclear facilities to the point that it is dangerous for people to remain and force evacuations. &#x201C;Russia is not a responsible stakeholder in the nuclear sector,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&apos;s using energy terrorism against Ukraine. You cannot be sure about what Russia is doing,&#x201D; the energy analyst added. Hi, it&apos;s Dominic Culverwell.

Ukraine sets up supervisory boards for lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, Defense Minister says	Separate boards were set up for the lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, a big step towards compliance with NATO standards, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a Facebook post on Oct. 11. &#x201C;We have finally established supervisory boards for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Non-lethal Defense Rear Agency (DOT),&#x201D; his post read. In a shake-up of ministry personnel earlier this month, Minister Rustem Umerov reshuffled the cards by requesting the dismissal of three of his deputies amid a debate with NATO over plans to unify military procurement into one agency. Umerov planned to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) into one agency but changed his mind after a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards should be established. This process of creating the supervisory boards concluded today, Umerov said in his Facebook post. The DPA, first established in August 2022, focuses solely on procuring lethal aid, while the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. The government also appointed Serhiy Boyev and Serhiy Melnykas as Umerov deputies, and dismissed deputy Oleksandr Balanutsa from his post, according to the minister. Umerov said that the boards would include Ukrainian and international experts, which would allow for integrating foreign experience to reform the defense sector. &#x201C;Their appointment is a significant step towards compliance with international standards. This guarantees independent control over processes, minimizes corruption risks, and increases trust in the system both within the country and on the part of our international partners,&#x201D; Umerov wrote.

‘Brave and unstoppable’ – Ukraine mourns journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna who died in Russian captivity	Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was about to be released from Russian captivity and returned home, when the news of her death broke out on Oct. 10, shocking Ukraine and the world. &#xA0; Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory. More than half a year later, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry finally confirmed she was in captivity. Since then, many journalists, activists, and organizations have advocated for her release. But hopes to see Roshchyna back in Ukraine and read more of her powerful reports shattered when Ukrainian authorities confirmed her death in Russian captivity. Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency, told Suspilne media outlet that Roshchyna was supposed to be included in an upcoming prisoner exchange. She was reportedly held in an infamous pre-trial detention center in the Russian city of Taganrog, known for the use of torture against the captives. Yusov said her return had been agreed upon, and the latest known information is that she was transferred to Moscow&#x2019;s Lefortovo prison, &#x201C;in preparation for her return home.&#x201D; Roshchyna reportedly died on Sept. 19. Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said on national television on Oct. 10 that the circumstances of Roshchyna&#x2019;s death are still being confirmed. At least 91 media workers have been killed by Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, including both those on assignment and those who had joined Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Another 30 media workers remain in Russian captivity. There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. According to Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity since Feb. 24, 2022. Victoria Roshchyna remained missing until April 2024, when her father received a letter from Moscow&apos;s Ministry of Defence confirming she was in Russian detention. (Nataliya Gumenyuk / Facebook)&quot;Victoria&#x2019;s passing is not just the loss of a remarkable woman, but of an intrepid witness to history. Regardless of her cause of death, we can say with certainty that her life was taken because she dared tell the truth,&quot; the International Women&#x2019;s Media Foundation (IWMF) said in a statement on Oct. 10. &quot;We hope her death will not be in vain: The international community must pressure Russia to cease targeting journalists and silencing press freedom.&quot; For Roshchyna, journalism was not just a job &#x2014; it was her calling and her whole life, as her friends and colleagues pointed out in numerous posts on social media following the news about her death. She started working as a journalist when she was still a teenager, often covering the most important topics and events for Ukraine. &quot;All of her topics were either connected to the war, organized crime or prosecution of activists,&quot; says the head of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit Yevheniia Motorevska, who worked with Roshchyna at Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske until 2022. When Russia launched the full-scale war, Roshchyna was reporting from Shchastia in Luhansk Oblast, one of the first cities that fell under occupation back then. She later covered Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for multiple Ukrainian news outlets, including Ukrainska Pravda, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), sometimes even risking her life and traveling to Russian-occupied areas to report from there. &quot;She believed journalists must write only about what they have witnessed firsthand. It was very important to her to communicate directly with the people living under occupation, with those living in combat zones,&quot; Motorevska says. &quot;She believed in journalism and her mission so deeply that it was more important than anything else. She always said, &apos;I&apos;m a journalist and I need to be there.&apos; Whether it was (Russian-occupied) Shchastia, Enerhodar, or Berdiansk.&quot; In March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving occupied Berdiansk and heading toward occupied Mariupol. Upon her release, she wrote in a column for Hromadske that even though she was threatened by Russians, she &quot;did not feel fear.&quot; &quot;There was only despair due to the uncertainty and wasted time, the inability to do work,&quot; she wrote. In 2022, the IWMF awarded Roshchyna the Courage in Journalism Award. Journalist Anastasiia Stanko wrote on X that Roshchyna &quot;was one of the very few who lived and died for this profession.&quot; Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was supposed to be soon released from Russian captivity and return home when the news of her death broke out on Oct. 10, 2024. (X)&quot;... For the sacred belief in the importance of seeing things with her own eyes and telling others about it. No matter how terrifying it was. And I feel very, very sad that all these beliefs are crumbling like dust,&quot; Stanko wrote. &quot;She was one of those journalists who didn&#x2019;t wait for editorial assignments. As soon as something happened, Vika was already there &#x2014; at protests, clashes, crime scenes. She took on the toughest challenges, loved covering law enforcement topics, and attended high-profile and important court hearings. Time and geography didn&#x2019;t matter to her &#x2014; at any moment, Viktoriia was ready to go on assignment even before being told to go. She didn&#x2019;t have weekends, vacations, or sick leave days,&quot; Hromadske said in a statement. Anna Babinets, head of the Slidstvo.Info investigative media outlet, wrote on Facebook that Roshchyna&apos;s colleagues considered her &quot;unstoppable.&quot; &quot;Her thirst for doing journalism, for doing the impossible, overcame her instinct for self-preservation. And the Russians killed her,&quot; she went on. &quot;She was ready to die for her right to be a journalist; this constantly pushed her toward places where death was,&quot; Katerina Sergatskova, board member of Hromadske, wrote on Facebook. &quot;I regret that we couldn&#x2019;t save Viktoriia Roshchyna, a journalist through and through,&quot; she said. Roshchyna was &quot;incredibly brave,&quot; according to Sevgil Musaieva, the chief editor of Ukrainska Pravda. &quot;She tackled the toughest topics. It was important for her to tell the stories of Ukrainians in occupied territories. She was impossible to stop or hold back. She was fully dedicated to journalism,&quot; Musaieva wrote on Facebook. &quot;Viktoriia was supposed to be exchanged in mid-September. She was meant to return home. Russia killed Vika.&quot; Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression. By telling all those painful stories, we are helping to keep the world informed about the reality of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine.

Russian troops renew assaults in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia oblasts, military says	Since the start of the week, Ukraine&apos;s forces have repelled 29 Russian attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Operational Command South said on Oct. 11. &quot;The defense forces of southern Ukraine in the Kherson Oblast repelled 29 assaults. During the past day, five assaults were recorded in the Kherson and two assaults in the Zaporizhzhia directions,&quot; the command said in a statement. Russia used 318 FPV drones, including 3 Lancet-type drones, and dropped 428 general-purpose bombs, Operational Command South said. Despite ongoing assaults, no gains were made. The statement aligns with an earlier warning of Ukraine&apos;s forces that Russia will aim for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the coming days. The new Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Kyiv announced the withdrawal from Vuhledar on Oct. 2, after Russian forces first swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and then entered its urban area. Russian troops committed to the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast outnumbered defending Ukrainian forces by around 9:1, Oleksandr Okhrimenko, commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, said in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Glavkom published on Oct. 8.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-renew-assaults-in-kherson-zaporizhzhia-oblasts-military-says/	2024-10-11T07:22:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2024826825.jpg
Putin meets with Iranian President Pezeshkian for first time	Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Iran&apos;s recently elected President Masoud Pezeshkian in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, on Oct. 11. It was the first time the two leaders had met. &quot;We are actively working together in the international arena and our assessments of events taking place in the world are often very close,&quot; Putin said. The Russian state-run media outlet TASS reported that Putin and Pezeshkian would discuss a number of bilateral issues, as well as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The meeting occurred against the backdrop of an international forum that leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan were invited to, among others. The Turkmen capital is hosting the forum called &quot;Interconnection of Times and Civilizations &#x2013; the Basis of Peace and Development,&quot; dedicated to the 300th anniversary of Turkmen poet and philosopher Magtymguly Fragi. Pezeshkian won Iran&apos;s runoff election in July earlier this year, defeating hard-liner Saeed Jalili. Internationally recognized monitors were not present to verify the results or guarantee the fairness of the election. The runoff election was triggered by the death of former President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister in a helicopter crash in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-meets-with-iranian-president/	2024-10-11T06:12:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177151439.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Germany for meeting with Scholz	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Germany on Oct. 11, meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelensky&apos;s visit is part of a broader European tour during which he hopes to ramp up support for Ukraine and its five-step victory plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-germany-for-meeting-with-scholz/	2024-10-11T05:59:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177153600.jpg
World Bank approves up to $50 billion in new funding for Ukraine, Reuters reports	The World Bank&apos;s executive committee approved on Oct. 10 the creation of a new fund for Ukraine that could provide up to $50 billion by the end of the year, Reuters reported, citing sources. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy and business, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country&apos;s economic sector. Concerns about the stability of future international funding for Ukraine have deepened in the leadup to the U.S. presidential election, with many fearing that a victory for Republican nominee Donald Trump could result in a reduction of American support. The new World Bank-administered financial intermediary fund (FIF) could help allay those concerns. &quot;This is a game-changing amount of money,&quot; said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council&apos;s GeoEconomics Center, referring to the combined effect of the new World Bank fund and an announcement the previous day that the EU had approved an additional 35 billion euro loan. &quot;It&apos;s real resources on the ground that can make a difference,&quot; Lipsky told Reuters. The funding will come from the U.S., Japan, and Canada, the sources said, adding that it will be backed by interest generated from frozen Russian assets. The exact amounts that each country would contribute were not specified.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-bank-approves-up-to-50-billion-in-new-funding-for-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2024-10-11T05:15:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg
Journalist Roshchyna, who died in Russian captivity, held in 'one of the most brutal detention centers,' NGO says	Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian captivity, was held in Russian detention centers where torture is used against the prisoners, the Media Initiative for Human Rights said on Oct. 11. Ukrainian officials confirmed Roshchyna&apos;s death on Oct. 10 but said that the circumstances of her death are still under investigation. The journalist disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory, with Moscow admitting her detention the following year. Previously, in March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life. The Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian NGO focused on human rights advocacy and investigations, said that Roshchyna was held in at least two prisons: the penal colony n. 77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center n. 2 in Russia&apos;s Taganrog. Both these detention facilities are known for the use of torture against the captives. The NGO said it is aware of cases of prisoners being electrocuted in the Berdiansk prison. The Taganrog detention center is &quot;considered one of the most brutal detention centers in Russia,&quot; the initiative said, citing former prisoners. Many Azov Brigade fighters captured after the siege of Azovstal are held here. &quot;Viktoria was held in Taganrog at least from May to September 2024, in solitary confinement,&quot; the NGO&apos;s executive director, Tetiana Katrychenko, said on Facebook. Roshchyna was taken out of Taganrog to an unknown location in September. According to Russia, she died on Sept. 19. It currently remains unclear where she was being transported, whether she was being transported for an exchange, and whether her death was a result of torture and abuse by Russian captors, the NGO said. Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency, told the Suspilne media outlet that Roshchyna was supposed to be included in an upcoming prisoner exchange. Ukrainian prosecutors, who were previously investigating Roshchyna&apos;s disappearance, have now re-classified the case as a war crime and murder. Roshchyna had covered Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for multiple Ukrainian news outlets, including Hromadske, Ukrainska Pravda, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-roshchyna/	2024-10-11T05:00:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/victoria.jpeg
Rome to host next Ukraine Recovery Conference on July 10-11, 2025	The next Ukraine Recovery Conference will take place in Rome on July 10-11, 2025, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Oct. 10 after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Rai News reported. The event will follow previous conferences in London in 2023 and Berlin in 2024 aimed at mobilizing support for Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction and recovery efforts. &quot;Looking at future peace and prosperity also means looking at reconstruction, and I am happy to announce that the &apos;Ukraine Recovery Conference&apos; will be held in Rome on 10 and 11 July 2025,&quot; Meloni said after meeting Zelensky in comments quoted by Rai News. Zelensky visited Italy as part of his European tour, which included visits to the U.K., France, and the Vatican. He is scheduled to travel to Germany later on Oct. 11 to meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz as Kyiv aims to ramp up support for Ukraine and its five-step victory plan. &quot;Ukraine is not alone; we will be by its side for as long as necessary,&quot; Meloni added. The next year&apos;s conference will include government officials from 77 countries, and it will host approximately 1,800 attendees, Italian officials previously said. Italy also hosted the G7 conference in June, at which the world&apos;s wealthiest democracies pledged a $50 billion loan for Ukraine, backed by proceeds from Russian frozen assets. In February, the World Bank estimated that Ukraine would need $486 billion over a 10-year period to repair the damages wrought by the Russian war.	https://kyivindependent.com/rome-recovery-conference/	2024-10-11T04:18:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-and-Meloni-1.jpeg
Russia launched new push in Kursk Oblast, Kyiv claims attack 'thwarted'	Russian forces launched a new counterattack against Ukraine&apos;s left flank in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, several Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels claimed on Oct. 10. A Ukrainian official commented that the &quot;Russian plan in Kursk Oblast has been thwarted so far&quot; as Russian forces suffered losses. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. &quot;No details yet, but the Russian military suffered significant losses in equipment,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &#xA0; DeepState, a Ukrainian crowdsourced monitoring website, reported late on Oct. 10 that Russia managed to push through the left flank of Ukraine&apos;s salient in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The enemy is now trying to establish a foothold near the settlements of Novoivanovka and Zeleny Shliakh,&quot; DeepState said on Telegram. The two settlements lie some 15 kilometers from the Ukrainian-held Russian town of Sudzha and around 10 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border. The estimated Ukrainian control (blue) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of Oct. 10, 2024. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Parallel messages also appeared on Russian pro-war channels. The well-known Rybar channel wrote that Russian forces launched several attacks in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, in which Ukraine established its foothold. &quot;The advanced groups of Russian troops reached Zeleny Shliakh by the end of the day, which allows us to claim at least a partial breakthrough in the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; defenses,&quot; Rybar claimed on Oct. 10. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry alleged late on Oct. 10 that its forces had &quot;penetrated&quot; into the Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast and inflicted losses on manpower and equipment. Later, on Oct. 11, DeepState reported that the situation in the area remains difficult, but Ukrainian forces are succeeding in stabilizing it. According to the channel, it was not yet possible to regain all the lost territory, but Russian forces suffered significant losses in the attack. The Kyiv Indepdnent could not verify all the claims. Russia launched another counterattack against Ukraine&apos;s left flank in mid-September, but this attempt was halted by Kyiv&apos;s troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-allegedly-launches-new-counterattack-in-kursk-oblast/	2024-10-11T03:44:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312567-1.jpg
US actor, Russian propagandist Steven Seagal says he would 'die for Putin' in new documentary	U.S. actor and Russian propagandist Steven Seagal said in a new documentary released on Oct. 10 that he was ready to fight for Russian President Vladimir Putin and &quot;die if need be.&quot; Seagal, who gained fame as an action star in the 1980s and 1990s, became enamored with Russia and Putin as his Hollywood career waned into a series of low-budget, direct-to-TV films. The actor and martial artist gained Russian citizenship in 2016, and was subsequently named by Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry as a &quot;Special Representative for Russia-US Cultural Links, Cultural and Historical Heritage in a voluntary capacity&quot; in 2018. He reportedly relocated to Moscow in 2021 to escape fines from the U.S. government. Seagal has also been accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Seagal has repeatedly praised Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and was one of the few Western &quot;celebrities&quot; to attend Putin&apos;s inauguration to his fifth term in office in May 2024. In Seagal&apos;s new documentary, entitled &quot;In the Name of Justice&quot; and shared on the Russian state-run media platform Smotrim, he is shown visiting various occupied territories of Ukraine, including Mariupol. Seagal is also shown speaking to civilians and sharing Kremlin propaganda talking points with the help of a translator and voiceover, as he does not appear to speak Russian. He also visits Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), purported to be Azov fighters. In one clip, Seagal says that he wrote a letter to Putin, saying, &quot;now we will see who are our true compatriots and friends, and who are our enemies. I will be on the side of my president and I will fight on the side of my president.&quot; There is no indication that the 72-year-old Seagal plans to participate in any military activities, combat or otherwise.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-actor-russian-propagandist-steven-seagal-says-he-would-die-for-putin-in-new-documentary/	2024-10-11T03:25:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151308816.jpg
Zelensky gives Pope painting about Bucha massacre during Vatican meeting	Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Vatican on Oct. 11 for a meeting with Pope Francis, marking another step in his European tour. During a meeting that lasted 35 minutes, the pope presented Ukraine&apos;s head of state with a bronze bas-relief with a flower and an inscription, &quot;peace is a fragile flower,&quot; the ANSA news agency wrote. In turn, Zelensky reportedly gave Pope Francis an oil painting named &quot;The Bucha Massacre &#x2013; the Story of Marichka.&quot; Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022 and saw some of Russia&apos;s worst atrocities against civilians during the full-scale war. The details of talks between Zelensky and the pope have not yet been made public. This is Zelensky&apos;s second private audience at the Vatican, though he and Pope Francis met at the G7 summit in Italy this year. Relations between Kyiv and the Holy See have been complicated by some of Pope Francis&apos;s remarks on Russia&apos;s war that were seen in Ukraine as calls for surrender to Russian aggression. While having repeatedly denounced Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and urging peace, Pope Francis&apos; call for Ukraine to &quot;not be ashamed to negotiate&quot; with Russia in March was met with apprehension in Kyiv and among its partners. The Vatican&apos;s relationship with Ukraine also came into the spotlight recently with the appointment of Mykola Bychok, a Ternopil-born bishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Australia, to the College of Cardinals. While the nomination of Ukraine&apos;s only cardinal was seen as a positive signal toward Kyiv by some, the decision to choose a lesser-known bishop over Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the primate of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, came as a surprise. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the Vatican follows his trips to the U.K., France, and Italy, where he met leaders of the respective countries to present them with Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan. The president is also expected to travel to Germany later on Oct. 11 to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukraine&apos;s head of state is touring the European countries to ramp up military support and mobilize backing behind the victory plan, which Kyiv describes as a path toward a just and lasting peace. The situation grows ever more dire for the besieged country as Russian forces keep pressing on in the east, and the population faces energy deficits in the coming winter. In the meantime, the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House next month prompts fears of weakened U.S. support.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-vatican/	2024-10-11T02:53:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177924750.jpg
Putin visits Turkmenistan for regional forum, meeting with Iran's president	Russian President Vladimir Putin began his visit to Turkmenistan on Oct. 11, speaking at an international forum attended by Central Asian leaders and the president of Iran. In his opening remarks in Ashgabat, Putin said he wants to build a &quot;new world order&quot; with Moscow&apos;s international partners. Turkmenistan capital is hosting the forum called &quot;Interconnection of Times and Civilizations &#x2013; the Basis of Peace and Development&quot; dedicated to the 300th anniversary of Turkmen poet and philosopher Magtymguly Fragi. Leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan have been invited to the forum, among others. Russia has traditionally sought to exert influence over Central Asia, though many nations of the region have begun gravitating toward China in recent years. The Kremlin&apos;s chief is also expected to meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian for bilateral talks and to discuss the situation in the Middle East, Putin&apos;s aide told journalists. Moscow and Tehran have deepened military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Iran supplying Russia with Shahed attack drones and short-range ballistic missiles. Putin has limited his travels abroad since the start of the full-scale invasion and since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against him over the forced deportation of Ukrainian children, traveling primarily to &quot;friendly&quot; countries. Turkmenistan is not a signatory of the Rome Statute and, therefore, not a party to the ICC.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-visits-turkmenistan/	2024-10-11T02:15:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177109022.jpg
Committee to Protect Journalists calls for halt to Kyiv's 'systematic pressure' against Ukrainska Pravda	The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement on Oct. 11 calling for the Ukrainian government to stop &quot;obstructing the reporting&quot; of Ukrainska Pravda. CPJ&apos;s appeal follows a similar statement from Ukrainska Pravda on Oct. 9, in which the media outlet accused the Presidential Office of conducting &quot;ongoing and systematic pressure&quot; in an attempt to &quot;influence our editorial policy.&quot; &quot;Ukrainska Pravda has paid a steep price for a quarter-century of rigorous reporting,&quot; said Gulnoza Said, CPJ&apos;s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. The alleged attempts to pressure the media outlet are &quot;nothing short of anti-democratic given the essential role of the newsroom in upholding a core national value of freedom of the press.&quot; &quot;Ukrainian authorities must never discourage investigative journalistic work, whether during periods of peace or war,&quot; Said concluded. CPJ, a U.S.-based NGO that works to promote press freedom and defend journalists, said that the Presidential Office had not yet responded to a request for comment. The Kyiv Independent has also reached out for comment but has not received an answer. The Presidential Office has not yet publicly commented on the accusations since Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s Oct. 9 statement. Ukraine&apos;s independent media has taken great strides since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but concerns have been raised since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#x200B;&#x200B;Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in June indicated the &quot;shrinking&quot; of press freedom in Ukraine, highlighting a &quot;worrying decline&quot; in support and respect for media autonomy and increased pressure from the state or other political actors inside Ukraine. The statement came one month after the annual press freedom index published by RSF showed Ukraine rising compared to last year. As the Kyiv Independent reported in July, media still face different forms of pressure from authorities, according to Ukrainian editors and press freedom watchdogs, months after attacks on investigative journalists provoked a public outcry and condemnation. &quot;We have often encountered pressure in our work. But the last time we faced such economic restrictions was during the presidency of (Leonid) Kuchma,&quot; Sevgil Musayeva, editor-in-chief of Ukrainska Pravda, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 9, referring to Ukraine&apos;s president from 1994-2005. Since being founded in 2000, two journalists from Ukrainska Pravda have been killed &#x2014; co-founder Georgiy Gongadze, and top editor Pavel Sheremet. Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv. &#x200B;&#x200B;Belarusian-born Sheremet was blown up in his car in central Kyiv on July 20, 2016. Musayeva stressed the importance of making public the pressure Ukrainska Pravda is facing and called on international audiences to take note. &quot;Ukraine must remain a democracy, and freedom of speech is one of the most important values in a free society,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/committee-to-protect-journalists-urges-kyivs-systematic-pressure-against-ukrainska-pravda-to-stop/	2024-10-11T01:49:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1235717430.jpg
Ukraine holds 40-50% of Toretsk, official says	Ukraine controls roughly 40-50% of the town of Toretsk while the rest has been captured by Russia, the city&apos;s military administration head, Vasyl Chynchyk, said on Oct. 11. Toretsk, a town some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk, is one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast, where Russian troops are steadily pushing back Ukrainian defenders step by step. Speaking on air on national television, Chynchyk said that roughly 1,150 people remain in the ruined town. Roughly 70,000 residents lived in Toretsk before the full-scale invasion. &quot;We are making every effort to evacuate civilians... The security situation allows entering the town and evacuating the population only in certain periods when there is a lull in fighting or favorable weather conditions,&quot; the official said. The Ukrainian military said earlier this week that fights are taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces are pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState indicates that settlements on the eastern outskirts of Toretsk &#x2013; Pivnichne, Zalizne, Druzhba, and Pivdenne &#x2013; are fully or almost completely in Russian hands. According to the monitoring group, Russian forces have been advancing along Tsentralna Street since late September and have reached the town&apos;s center as of October. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. &quot;The situation is very bad, and if our command doesn&apos;t send reserves there in the nearest future, the situation would be very difficult, if not catastrophic,&quot; Ukrainian military expert Mykhailo Zhyrokhov told the Kyiv Independent. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-holds-40-50-of-toretsk/	2024-10-11T01:23:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158844256.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 27 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least six people and injured at least 27 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 11. Russia launched a missile attack against the Odesa district, hitting a two-story building and killing four people, including a 16-year-old girl. Ten people were injured, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed one person in Novoselydivka, injured two in Myrnohrad, and two others in Lyman and Yampil, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 64-year-old woman was killed in an attack against the village of Kruhliakivka, and a 77-year-old man was injured during a strike on Kupiansk, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five people suffered shock during an attack against the village of Cherkaska Lozova. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast injured three people, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. A critical infrastructure facility, a car center, a gas station, and other buildings were targeted. An ambulance, a trolley bus, and other vehicles were also damaged. Russia launched an Iskander-M missile against a critical infrastructure facility in Mykolaiv on Oct. 10, injuring two women aged 59 and 52 and a 57-year-old man, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. A fire that broke out was promptly extinguished, and four apartment buildings and one house were damaged. Six people were injured during a Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia on Oct. 10, regional authorities said. Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Luhansk, and Sumy oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-97/	2024-10-11T00:46:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-11_07-50-24.jpg
Multi-vehicle crash involving passenger bus in Lviv Oblast kills at least 3	A car crash involving a passenger bus, a Nova Poshta truck, and other vehicles in Lviv Oblast on Oct. 11 killed at least three people and wounded 35 more, including six children, said Governor Maksym Kozytskyi. &#xA0; The wounded are being treated and have injuries of varying severity, Kozytskyi said. The accident occurred near the village of Chishky, located some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the city of Lviv. The passenger bus, which bore the logo of the popular transport company FlixBus, was running from Warsaw to Odesa, Kozytskyi said. The incident is being investigated by law enforcement, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/multi-vehicle-crash-involving-passenger-bus-in-lviv-oblast-kills-at-least-3/	2024-10-11T00:30:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-11-11_25_28.jpeg
Ukraine destroys Russian Mi-8 helicopter in Kharkiv Oblast, military says	A Russian Mi-8 helicopter was destroyed in Kharkiv Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said in its operational update on Oct. 11. The Mi-8 is a Soviet-era aircraft used most commonly as a transport aircraft by both the Russian military and civilian government departments. It can also be used for combat and command purposes. The helicopter has an estimated price tag of around $10-15 million. The General Staff did not provide any more details about how the helicopter was destroyed. According to the General Staff&apos;s update on Oct. 11, Russia has lost 329 helicopters since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-russian-mi-8-helicopter-in-kharkiv-oblast-military-says/	2024-10-11T00:00:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1230966025-1.jpg
Russia has redeployed 50,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi claims	Russia has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10, more than two months after the start of Kyiv&apos;s incursion. &quot;We know about roughly 50,000 soldiers from other sectors who were transferred to the Kursk direction,&quot; Syrskyi said in a documentary aired on national television. Ukraine launched the offensive into Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) and 100 settlements. The Ukrainian leadership said that one of the key goals of the operation was to divert Russian forces from Ukrainian battlefields. Syrskyi&apos;s figure is an increase from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s estimation from Sept. 19, when he said that 40,000 troops had been diverted to the Kursk sector. According to Syrskyi, the redeployment weakened Russian positions in other areas, namely in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kramatorsk sectors. &quot;This, of course, made it easier for us to conduct defensive operations,&quot; he noted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Even though Ukrainian forces continue to hold Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, the Russian offensive keeps grinding on in Ukraine&apos;s east. The Ukrainian military was recently forced to withdraw from Vuhledar, a town in the south of Donetsk Oblast that has withstood Russian attacks for two years. Heavy battles are also ongoing in Chasiv Yar and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, and Russian troops are closing in on a key logistics hub in Pokrovsk. In the meantime, Russia seeks to dislodge Ukrainian troops from its home turf in Kursk Oblast, attacking Ukraine&apos;s salient from the west. While Kyiv&apos;s forces managed to halt a Russian counterattack in mid-September, the DeepState monitoring site said on Oct. 10 that Russian forces recently achieved tactical success on Ukraine&apos;s left flank. Russia has allegedly concentrated a considerable force in the area and is trying to get a foothold near the village of Novoianovka. Senior U.S. officials told Bloomberg that Ukrainian forces should be able to hold seized territory in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast for several months or longer thanks to a steady flow of supplies and Moscow&apos;s focus on eastern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-redeployed-50-000-troops-to-kursk-oblast-syrskyi-claims/	2024-10-10T23:24:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg

General Staff: Russia has lost 666,340 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 666,340 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 11. This number includes 1,140 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,953 tanks, 17,800 armored fighting vehicles, 26,398 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,322 artillery systems, 1,229 multiple launch rocket systems, 976 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 16,837 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-666-340-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-10T22:18:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2149869538.jpg
Norway allocates more than $87 million to increase weapons production for Ukraine	Norway&#x2019;s government will allocate up to 967 million kroner (around $87.5 million) to enhance its defense industry, with a focus on supporting Ukraine amidst Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense said that the funds will support four new projects to boost production of crucial components, including rocket engines and explosives, needed for manufacturing air defense missiles and munitions essential for Ukraine&apos;s defense. Bjorn Arild Gram, Norway&#x2019;s Defense Minister, stated that the initiative is part of a broader plan to boost Norway&#x2019;s defense industrial capabilities. Also, the country will provide support to small and medium-sized Norwegian companies working on technologies essential for the Ukrainian armed forces. &#x201C;There is now a large and critical need for defense equipment both in Ukraine and among allies,&#x201D; Gram noted. Additionally, Norway announced $9.5 million to continue evacuating severely wounded Ukrainians for treatment in Europe. Recently, Zelensky said he was grateful to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and all political parties in the Norwegian Parliament. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-allocates-more-than-87-million-to-increase-weapons-production-for-ukraine/	2024-10-10T21:03:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1623063883.jpg
Zelensky presents victory plan to Italian PM Meloni	President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s victory plan to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during his visit to Italy. The two leaders had a productive discussion focused on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s position and fostering close diplomatic relations with its partners. &quot;I especially want to thank you for the security assistance provided to our country - first of all, air defense systems that save lives in our cities and villages,&#x201D; Zelensky said via Telegram. He also mentioned that they discussed preparing a new security package. Zelensky also presented Ukraine&apos;s victory plan to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the former&apos;s visit to London on Oct. 10. Additionally, he introduced his five-point plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House during his trip to the U.S. in late September. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. &quot;The victory plan aims to create the right conditions for a just end to the war. It is a bridge to the second peace summit. Ukraine can negotiate only from a strong position,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-presents-victory-plan-to-italian-pm-meloni/	2024-10-10T18:39:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/meloni.jpg
Russia expands visa-free entry for Georgian citizens	Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree on Oct. 10 expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia, as Moscow continues to cozy relations with Tbilisi amid concerns over the country&apos;s democratic backsliding. The decree expands visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in the country beyond 90 days, RFE/RL reported. The development comes as the EU is weighing the potential end to Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the bloc as a result of democratic backsliding under the ruling Georgian Dream party. The proposed plan to end Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the EU, first granted in 2017, was the latest step in the deteriorating relations between Georgia and the West. Following rumors in recent weeks that the visa-free regime might be ended, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze characterized the proposal as a &quot;cheap blackmail attempt.&quot; Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. Moscow&apos;s &quot;foreign agents&quot; registry has been widely used to target and silence groups and individuals who are critical of the government, including independent journalists, activists, and NGOs - with many Georgians fearing a similar outcome in Georgia. In recent weeks, de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, further attempted to cozy relations with Russia by declaring that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-eases-visa-requirements-for-georgian-citizens/	2024-10-10T15:48:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150233392.jpg
War risk insurance surges after recent Russian strikes on foreign vessels in Black Sea, Bloomberg reports	War risk insurance premiums for vessels traversing Ukraine&#x2019;s shipping corridor in the Black Sea have increased by about 33 per cent following Russia&apos;s recent attacks on foreign ships, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 10, citing sources in the market. According to the insurance market sources, coverage has jumped to above one per cent of the value of a ship, up from around 0.75 per cent last week. The increase in rates follows Russian strikes on three foreign ships flying the flags of Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Panama within a four day stretch between Oct. 6-9. The Saint Kitts and Nevis vessel attacked on Oct. 6 was loaded with about 6,000 tons of Ukrainian corn intended for export. While on Oct. 7, five foreign nationals were injured and one port employee was killed in the attack on the Palau-flagged boat. No details were provided as to what the second vessel was carrying. A Russian missile strike on Odesa Oblast on Oct. 9 also hit a Panama-flagged civilian cargo ship containing 45 containers of packaged sunflower oil to be sent as humanitarian aid to Palestine, Ukraine&apos;s Agriculture Ministry said on Oct. 10. Under the increased premiums, a ship valued at $50 million would see an increase of $125,000 per voyage. Increased instability in the Black Sea has lead to wheat futures in Chicago rising 2.5 per cent thus far this week, Bloomberg reported. Traveling along the route, Ukrainian ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. Kyiv was forced to set up a new export route in the Black Sea last year after Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-risk-insurance-surges-after-recent-russian-strikes-on-foreign-vessels-bloomberg-reports/	2024-10-10T14:40:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1438334585.jpg
Russia gains Donbas ground as Ukraine’s Western allies delay weaponry talks	Russia&#x2019;s invading army is racing against the weather clock, trying to seize yet more towns in Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region before the ground gets muddy this autumn and temperatures later plunge. The coal mining town of Toretsk is on the verge of falling to Moscow&#x2019;s forces, an outcome which would make it the latest in a handful of towns and villages falling in recent months to Russia&#x2019;s grinding Donbas offensive launched a year ago. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think the town will hold out for long,&#x201D; said Ukrainian artilleryman Oleksandr with the 109th Territorial Defense Brigade deployed in the area, stressing that there is a &#x201C;serious shortage of people.&#x201D; Fierce house-to-house fighting rages in Toretsk, a Ukrainian stronghold since Russia&#x2019;s first invasion of Donbas in 2014 following the occupation of Crimea. For most of the first two years of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022, it was tucked away in a calmer part of the front line until Russian forces started storming it this June. &#x201C;The situation is very bad, and if our command doesn&apos;t send reserves there in the nearest future, the situation would be very difficult, if not catastrophic,&#x201D; Ukrainian military expert Mykhailo Zhyrokhov told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;We are now in autumn, and the Russians understand that when the weather changes and it becomes impossible to organize logistics, their offensive will stop. So while the weather is more or less okay, they are trying to capture as much as possible,&#x201D; he added. The Ukrainian military has admitted that the situation in Toretsk, where some 1,200 civilians remain, is deteriorating. Russian troops have entered Toretsk&#x2019;s eastern outskirts and are trying to move toward the central mine in the western part of the town, military spokeswoman Anastasia Bobovnikova reported on Oct. 7.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)According to Oleksandr and military analysts interviewed, the fate of Toretsk depends on whether Ukraine can allocate reserve units and scarce artillery shells to prevent a further Russian advance. Ukraine is often forced to prioritize some sectors of the front line more than others due to a severe shortage of resources &#x2014; from ammunition to equipment and manpower. Earlier this month, Ukraine lost Vuhledar, another mining town located 80 kilometers southwest of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. The deepening Russian advance comes as Ukraine scrambles to secure as many resources and weapons as possible for its troops before the uncertain U.S. presidential election. The regular Ukrainian Defense Contact Group meeting meant to gather leaders of 50-plus countries to discuss further Ukraine aid this weekend at Ramstein airbase in Germany, was postponed due to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s cancellation of his Europe trip this week. Biden put off the visit due to a hurricane hammering the southern state of Florida. &quot;As winter approaches, we need support,&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Oct. 10 during a meeting in Paris. Zelensky spoke while on tour, taking the opportunity of the Ramstein meeting being canceled to travel to European capitals to rally support for boosting weaponry supplies to his country. Earlier in the day, Zelensky held talks in London with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Some Ukrainian soldiers expressed their concerns that the instability of Western military aid makes it extremely difficult for Kyiv to plan on the battlefield. &#x201C;There is no possibility of good planning ... because we are very dependent on our allies,&#x201D; said Anton, an acting commander of a reconnaissance platoon with the 112th Territorial Defense Force Brigade deployed in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. &#x201C;We are fighting here today and now. And what will happen tomorrow is unknown. Maybe we can hold those positions, but if there will be no artillery shells, these positions will be lost very quickly.&#x201D; Ukrainian military servicemen look on towards the town of Toretsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast on June 25, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)For Oleksandr, who is defending the Ukrainian-controlled parts of Toretsk, the ammunition shortage in his unit has worsened since April, leaving insufficient amounts to target all Russian positions. He said that his artillery battery, which operates on four different weapon systems, only receives enough shells to shoot five to ten times daily. And compared to a few months ago when Russian troops were only trying to advance where they saw the opportunities, &#x201C;they are heavily trying to assault&#x201D; Ukrainian defense positions in the area, he added. &#xA0; The Russian military has increasingly become better at exploiting weak spots to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with a massive quantity of troops and firepower. Moscow accelerated its push on Toretsk after capturing Vuhledar earlier in October, advancing deeper into the central part of Donetsk Oblast nearly five months after it took advantage of a poorly organized Ukrainian rotation of units to penetrate through the 2014 defense in May. Besides Toretsk, the current hottest spots of the war are the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors west and southwest of Toretsk. However, there are signs that Russia may begin a new push elsewhere to further stretch Ukrainian troops, according to Western and Ukrainian military experts. A map capturing the situation unfolding around the town of Toretsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast as of October 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which has provided detailed coverage of the war from open sources, said Ukraine faces a difficult balancing act between its ability to replace casualties with fresh troops while trading &#x201C;as little ground as possible in order to inflict heavy casualties to the Russians.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s always about trading land for (Russian) casualties in this situation,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. &#x201C;Ukrainian commanders need to carefully always consider what position to leave in order to spare some of their own troops, but not to let the Russians into too favorable positions.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s Donbas offensive, which has cost them, according to various estimates, hundreds to more than a thousand troops per day over the past year, has &#x201C;been really, really expensive and a long process,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. &#x201C;If all places take this long and cost this much, the Russians won&#x2019;t be able to achieve any of their goals in the war,&#x201D; Kastehelmi added, referring to the Russian army&#x2019;s two-year-long attempts to capture Vuhledar. Since Russia began a large-scale offensive on Avdiivka one year ago, relying on a seemingly endless wave of battalion-sized mechanized assaults, it has held the initiative across most of the battlefield, albeit at a massive cost in terms of losses. After capturing the small industrial city just outside Russian-occupied Donetsk in February, Moscow&#x2019;s troops have toppled over scores of villages to almost reach the key logistic artery connecting the lower and upper parts of Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; and thereby threatening the roadway junction and supply line city of Pokrovsk. When Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in August, Moscow took advantage of Kyiv&#x2019;s attention shift to the northeast by intensifying attacks on Pokrovsk. Russian troops are now less than 10 kilometers from the key logistic hub that connects the last Ukrainian-held eastern strongholds with the cities westward. Despite Russia&#x2019;s proximity to Pokrovsk compared to the 15 kilometers-distance it was at before the Kursk incursion, military analysts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine appears to have stabilized the front line for now, and the defense lines appear prepared. About 30 kilometers southward, another worrying situation is developing around Kurakhove, which hosts a large reservoir. Russian troops are less than five kilometers from the town, trying to further solidify the northern and southern flanks to threaten encirclement. However, a far more serious full encirclement threat is unfolding to the northeast of Kurakhove. Russian troops surround a Ukrainian pocket along both banks of the Vovcha River from three sides. The pocket is only roughly eight kilometers from being completely encircled. However, experts are confident that Ukraine could withdraw on time when the situation becomes critical, given that it is a field, and retreating would not be too hard. Further south, Russia appears to be preparing for a further push upwards after capturing Vuhledar earlier in October. Vuhledar was important as it served as an intersection between the front lines of Donetsk and southeastern Zaporizhzhia oblasts, according to Serhiy Zgurets, director of the Ukrainian information and consulting company Defense Express. Evacuation of the civilian population from the city of Toretsk Donetsk Oblast on July 30, 2024. (Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)The Ukrainian military has reported since late September that Russia may begin a push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and has begun limited assault operations to pressure Ukrainian defenses there. &#x201C;(Russian troops) are now trying to activate actions in the southern direction to again create conditions to stretch our reserves (in an area of the front line that was calmer),&#x201D; Zgurets said. Before Russia&#x2019;s capture of Vuhledar, Ukrainian troops used artillery to threaten Moscow&#x2019;s logistics on parts of Highway H20 in Russian-occupied territories that lead up to cities further south like Volnovakha and Mariupol, Zgurets explained. The town is also important to Moscow as it is located at a height, allowing Moscow to form a &#x201C;reliable transport corridor&#x201D; for its troops in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, he added. Kastehelmi from the Black Bird Group said there are signs that Russia may be intensifying its push in areas like near Siversk in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Oct. 4 that it captured the village of Verkhnokamianske, a claim neither confirmed nor refuted by Ukraine. There may have been &#x201C;possible developments&#x201D; in the Siversk area. Still, it is unclear whether they are small Russian reconnaissance groups or whether Russian forces have been able to secure gains there. &#x201C;When a country is fighting an attritional war, gradual gains can, of course, develop into rather sudden developments,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. &#x201C;So, it&apos;s possible that the defenses can start crumbling more quickly. In a certain sector, we aren&apos;t seeing that yet, but it&apos;s not impossible.&#x201D; &#x201C;If the Russians are able to replenish their own losses at a quick pace, and if the Ukrainians are still burdened by the current problems regarding equipment, manpower and so on, then the situation can become such that there the Russians may be able to advance more quickly in some sectors.&#x201D; But for now, all eyes remain on Toretsk as the Russians advance deeper into the town. &#x201C;It is clear that we would lose (Toretsk) in the nearest days,&#x201D; and it is extremely difficult to hold the defense with the current quantity of troops and resources as the Russian troops advance along its Central Street, according to Zhyrokhov. Other experts, including the Black Bird Group&apos;s Kastehelmi, are more skeptical of Moscow&apos;s offensive capability. Kastehelmi said that the battle of Toretsk could carry on into Winter at the current pace and finds it &quot;unlikely that the Russians will be able to capture the whole city during the next couple of autumn months.&quot; The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s News Editor Chris York contributed to this report.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-on-verge-of-losing-more-eastern-territory-as-russia-digs-deeper-into-donbas/	2024-10-10T14:04:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg
Large fire erupts at oil depot in occupied Crimea's Feodosia at site of previous Ukrainian strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being update. A large fire erupted at an oil depot terminal in Russian-occupied Feodosia lateat night on Oct. 10 at the site of a previous Ukrainian drone strike, where another blaze has been burning for four days, local media reported. According to the telegram channel Crimean Wind, the &quot;intense&quot; fire, which broke out around 9 p.m. local time, was large enough to be visible from within all neighborhoods of the city. Videos of the fire circulating on social media show a large explosion engulf the night sky with flames billowing a few dozen meters into the sky. The fire occurred at the site of another ongoing oil depot fire at the Marine Oil Terminal in Feodosia which was caused by a Ukrainian missile strike on Oct. 7. 0:00/1&#xD7;A large fire erupts at an oil depot at the Marine Oil Terminal in the city of Feodosia in occupied Crimea on Oct. 10, 2024 at the site of a previous Ukrainian missile strike. (Crimean Wind/Telegram)The cause of the latest fire is unclear, and Ukraine has not yet commented on situation. Local authorities confirmed the incident, adding that there has been the release of unspecified &quot;flammable materials&quot; at the site of one of the fires. As of Oct. 10, 1,137 people had been evacuated from the area, said Igor Tkachenko, the Russian-installed proxy head of Feodosia. The Russian-installed governor claimed that no additional evacuations were being conducted following the latest fire. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims by the Russian officials. The Feodosia terminal is the largest in Crimea for handling oil products, with only one other terminal of its kind located in Sevastopol. The terminal was previously targeted by Ukrainian drones in March 2024 when four drones struck the depot, damaging the main fuel pipeline and causing a fire, which took over an hour to extinguish. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-erupts-at-oil-depot-in-occupied-crimeas-feodosia-at-site-previous-ukrainian-strike/	2024-10-10T13:03:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-04-083245.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine confirms strike on Russian airbase in North Caucasus housing Su-34, Su-27 jets	Key developments on Oct. 10: Ukrainian forces carried out a successful strike against Russia&apos;s Khanskaya military airfield in the Adygea Republic, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed on Oct. 10. The confirmation comes shortly after Adygea Republic authorities reported a drone attack against the region early on Oct. 10. The Russian Telegram news channel Astra wrote about explosions near the airfield the same morning. &quot;During the attack, 57 warplanes, trainer aircraft, and helicopters were based at the airfield. This included Su-34 and Su-35 jets and Mi-8 helicopters,&quot; a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. The General Staff also reported that Su-27 fighter jets were based at the airfield. The operation was carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, according to the SBU source and the General Staff. Also on Oct. 10, drones operated by SBU, HUR, the military, and the Special Operations Forces hit a Shahed drone storage facility near the Russian city of Yeysk, the source added, resulting in explosions and a powerful fire. The extent of damage inflicted on the aircraft in Adygea is being determined. According to the General Staff, the strike damaged an ammunition warehouse, resulting in a fire, which is also visible in footage shared on social media. The airfield is located near the village of Khanskaya, close to the region&apos;s capital city of Maykop, and roughly 430 kilometers (270 miles) from the front line. The Khanskaya airfield is home to Russia&apos;s 272nd Training Aviation Regiment. Citing satellite imagery, the Defense Express outlet gave a lower estimate on the number of aircraft based at the airfield. Satellite footage from Oct. 6 shows 12 aircraft of an unknown type stationed in the airbase, which is roughly the size of one tactical aviation squadron. It is currently unclear whether the figure given by the SBU source was an overestimation or whether Russia moved additional aircraft to the airbase in the past few days. According to the source, Russia uses the airbase for refueling and to support airstrikes against Ukrainian military positions and population centers. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s victory plan to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the former&apos;s visit to London on Oct. 10. Zelensky already presented his five-point plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House during his trip to the U.S. in late September. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&apos;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. After arriving in the U.K. earlier on Oct. 10, Zelensky outlined the details of the plan to Starmer, focusing on points related to military support for Kyiv. &quot;The leaders agreed to work on the plan together with the allies,&quot; the Presidential Office said. &quot;The victory plan aims to create the right conditions for a just end to the war. It is a bridge to the second peace summit. Ukraine can negotiate only from a strong position,&quot; Zelensky commented after the meeting. Zelensky and Starmer also met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss Ukraine&apos;s Euro-Atlantic integration and military support. Rutte visited Kyiv last week on his first trip to Ukraine&apos;s capital as NATO&apos;s chief, a position he assumed on Oct. 1. &quot;During the meeting, the parties discussed the swift implementation of NATO Washington Summit decisions, in particular, on strengthening Ukraine with new air defense systems, enhancing aviation capabilities, and allied investments in Ukrainian production of shells, drones, and long-range weaponry,&quot; according to the Presidential Office. Zelensky&apos;s tour will continue with visits to France, Italy, and Germany in an effort to ramp up support across the European continent ahead of the uncertain U.S. election. Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist held captive by Russia, has died, said Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, on national television on Oct. 10. The circumstances of her death are still being confirmed, Yatsenko said. Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory. Her father received a letter from Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry in April of the following year confirming that she was being detained by Russian authorities. Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency, told the Suspilne media outlet that Roshchyna was supposed to be included in an upcoming prisoner exchange. Roshchyna had covered Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for multiple Ukrainian news outlets, including Hromadske, Ukrainska Pravda, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). In March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life. Russian emergency services were unable to extinguish a fire for the fourth day after it erupted at an oil depot in Russia-occupied Feodosia after a strike, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Crimean service reported on Oct. 10. Ukrainian missile forces targeted the largest oil depot in occupied Crimea in the early hours of Oct. 7, resulting in a large-scale fire. The Marine Oil Terminal is the largest facility for oil product handling in Crimea; the only other terminal of its kind on the peninsula is located in Sevastopol. As of Oct. 10, 1,137 people had been evacuated from the area, said Igor Tkachenko, the Russian-installed proxy head of Feodosia. The authorities warned that the amount of water needed to extinguish the fire may also affect the quality and quantity of water supplies for the residents. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. Recently, a fire following a Ukrainian strike in the Kavkaz oil and petroleum storage facility just outside Proletarsk, a town in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, was extinguished after 11 days and injured 49 Russian firefighters. A Russian missile strike on Odesa Oblast on Oct. 9 hit a civilian cargo ship containing 45 containers of packaged sunflower oil to be sent as humanitarian aid to Palestine, Ukraine&apos;s Agriculture Ministry said on Oct. 10. The strike, which killed eight people and injured another 11, hit a Panama-flagged civilian vessel and damaged its cargo of aid. It was the third Russian attack against a civilian vessel in four days. The U.N. had delivered an order for the aid to be sent to Palestine. &quot;Ukraine, despite the war, supplies products for 400 million people around the world,&quot; said Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval. Koval emphasized that Ukraine needs more air defenses to protect itself from Russian attacks, adding that &quot;today the food security of Ukraine is also the food security of the world.&quot; Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper accused Russia of attempting to disrupt Ukraine&apos;s maritime food corridor, which Kyiv established in August 2023 after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July. Ukraine has previously sent humanitarian aid to Palestine amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-confirms-strike-on-russian-airbase-in-north-caucasus-housing-su-34-su-27-jets/	2024-10-10T12:02:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Maykop.jpg

‘Game changer:’ EBRD on largest investment since start of war into newly merged Ukrainian telecoms company	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation on Oct. 10 said they would provide $435 million to finance a recently merged Ukrainian telecoms company. The funding is part of a deal &#x2014; led by French billionaire Xavier Niel &#x2014; that represents the largest foreign direct investment in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. Niel&#x2019;s investment holding NJJ Capital, in partnership with Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private equity firm Horizon Capital, announced in September that it would acquire and merge Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell with service provider Datagroup-Volia. The new company &#x2014; Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell &#x2014; will be headed by Mykhailo Shelemba, former CEO of Datagroup-Volia and shareholder of the new entity. The merger will create the second-largest fixed-mobile convergent operator, Holger Muent, EBRD&apos;s director of telecommunications, media, and technology, told the Kyiv Independent in an interview. Kyivstar is the country&#x2019;s largest. &#x201C;Bringing two leading operators in separate sectors together into one is a game changer for the industry,&#x201D; Muent said, adding that the deal would be significant in peacetime, but is even more so during war. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Muent to discuss what the deal means for Ukraine and its telecoms sector and plans for further investment. This interview has been edited for clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Besides much-needed foreign direct investment, what does a deal like this bring to Ukraine and its telecoms market? Holger Muent: The telecoms sector is extremely important for the country, both in general and in the current context of the war. Keeping the banking sector functioning, government services that have shifted online, and online education driven by the circumstances of the war &#x2014; all of this hinges on a functioning telecoms sector. Merging the two and creating a fixed mobile conversion operator creates additional redundancy, speed in the network, more reliability, and better services. That is good generally in any market, but particularly in Ukraine in the current circumstances. For example, you can connect the mobile base stations to the fiber network so you have redundancy in speed there as well. The merger also creates competition, which creates choice and competitive pressure, which in my view is just good. You also have the entry of a very knowledgeable, experienced, and deep-pocketed investor into the sector. If you think in terms of bringing in practices that have been tried somewhere else that are up there with the best management and technical practices, it&#x2019;s a game changer. The Kyiv Independent: How does this deal fit into the larger picture of a struggling European telecoms market where companies are in debt and struggling to find growth? Holger Muent: NJJ Capital goes for the higher risk-higher growth opportunities, so from that point of view, it makes sense. The underlying factor of the situation in Europe is that a lot of the value that comes from increased speed and connectivity doesn&#x2019;t accrue to the telecoms operators, but to the content providers and tech companies. If you look at the total value created in the system, the guys who actually make the connection, don&apos;t actually capture a lot of it and that creates pressure on the industry. A lot of it has to do with regulation. Ukraine is at a totally different stage. Firstly, there is a relatively low coverage with large parts of rural areas that don&apos;t have decent access so there&apos;s a lot of what is pretty basic connectivity that needs to be established and that obviously will expand the market. But you&apos;re not yet at the stage where it&apos;s all about 5G and 100% fiber, and where a lot (of the value) goes to tech companies.

(Viacheslav Mavrychev/Suspilne Ukraine/JSC &quot;UA:PBC&quot;/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: What are the plans to expand coverage and access as part of the investment? Holger Muent: The merger itself creates the opportunity for convergence, but there needs to be additional investment, including in additional coverage, reaching regions that haven&apos;t been covered so far, and increasing speeds. In the fixed line network, I expect speeds to increase over the next few years by maybe four or five times. Consumers, businesses, and government agencies will have more availability, more people can reach these services, and the services will be delivered at a higher speed, which also changes what kind of service or what kind of content can be delivered. The convergence will be implemented quite soon and that takes some physical investment, not necessarily country-wide digging of holes to put cable in the ground, but targeted capital expenditure that will happen very soon. The Kyiv Independent: The risks during a war like this are enormous &#x2014; how concerning is the risk that the worst could come to pass, that Ukraine could lose the war, or that this winter will be the worst since the start of the full-scale invasion to a deal like this? Holger Muent: The catastrophic risk exists, but at the EBRD we are confident that it will not materialize because otherwise, we would not be putting $1.5 billion into Ukraine every year. The power situation is obviously a very serious concern and is a focus of our operations as we put a lot of money every year into improving the resilience and reconstruction of the energy sector. This deal actually creates energy efficiency by creating redundancy in the system. If you transmit data through fiber, it takes less energy than doing it via radio signal. You also get network efficiency because you have a wider array of paths that you can route data through. Choosing the optimal route for that data reduces energy consumption. Obviously, that&#x2019;s not insurance against the catastrophic risk, but it does help to mitigate power outages and generally reduces the load on the energy sector to some extent, so it plays its part in that. The Kyiv Independent: Is this process already underway? Holger Muent: That is the big thing. DataGroup-Volia has a lot of cable in the ground already so that can be tapped into for the mobile network now. Before they were run as separate networks, but now, they&#x2019;re combined and run together. It won&apos;t happen tomorrow, but it&apos;s the near-term plan to make this happen. And then obviously there will be an expansion of the fiber network and of the mobile network, but in step together.	https://kyivindependent.com/game-changer-ebrd-on-largest-investment-since-start-of-war-into-newly-merged-ukrainian-telecoms-company/	2024-10-10T09:05:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1857415237.jpg
Kadyrov claims group of Russian lawmakers are plotting his assassination	Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov accused three Russian lawmakers of plotting to kill him in a video posted on his Telegram account on Oct. 9 and warned he would call for a &quot;blood feud&quot; if they did not prove their innocence. &quot;There are witnesses, there are people from whom they tried to commission, whom they asked how much they would take for the order,&quot; Kadyrov said in Chechen to other officials from the North Caucasian republic. Kadyrov named three lawmakers, Bekhan Barakhoyev, Suleiman Kerimov, and Rizvan Kurbanov, from neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia, as potentially being behind the plot. The accusation was in relation to a violent incident in September at the Moscow headquarters of Wildberries, Russia&apos;s largest online retailer, in which two people were killed and several others were arrested. Wildberries&apos; press service said that the fight broke out when Vladislav Bakalchuk, the estranged husband of the company&apos;s founder Tatiana Kim (formerly Bakalchuk), tried to &quot;illegally&quot; enter the building with his security guards. Kim said that Bakalchuk had attempted to seize the offices together with another co-founder, Sergey Anufriev, and former chairman of the board of directors, Vladimir Bakin, Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported. Several of those involved, including the two who were killed in the incident, come from the North Caucasus. Kadyrov has previously said that he supports Vladislav Bakalchuk&apos;s effort to stop the planned merger of Wildberries with another company. Kadyrov&apos;s comments were his first public statements since the business dispute turned deadly. In a post in Russian accompanying the video, the Chechen leader was less directly accusatory, but said that &quot;if anyone has any complaints against Kadyrovites, they should come to me, as I am the main Kadyrovite.&quot; The term is typically used to describe Chechen soldiers fighting under Kadyrov&apos;s command. &quot;Anyone who thinks that it is possible to pit entire nations against each other on domestic grounds is deeply mistaken,&quot; Kadyrov said, referring to allegations that Chechens were behind the Wildberries dispute. &quot;If you have questions for me, then there are no problems. I am waiting!&quot; he concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/kadyrov-claims-group-of-russian-lawmakers-are-plotting-his-assassination/	2024-10-10T08:05:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151325824.jpg
Russia denies North Korean soldiers are fighting in Ukraine as evidence mounts	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed reports of North Korean soldiers fighting in Ukraine, telling reporters that it was &quot;another bit of fake news.&quot; Earlier in October, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers that North Korea was likely planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia. When asked about a recent report by Ukrainian media that North Korean soldiers were killed and injured near occupied Donetsk, Kim said that it was also likely true. The group of North Korean soldiers arrived in the Russian-held part of Ukraine to exchange experience with their Russian counterparts, Interfax-Ukraine reported on Oct. 4, citing a military intelligence source. Six were reportedly killed and three injured in a missile attack. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. In recent weeks, claims of a more direct North Korean presence in Ukraine have increased. The Guardian reported on Oct. 10, citing an unnamed source in Ukraine, that there are &quot;dozens of North Koreans behind Russian lines&quot; to assist with the launching of Pyongyang-supplied Kn-23 ballistic missiles. Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, told AFP that the deployment of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine could be viewed from Pyongyang as an opportunity for its military to learn &quot;how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience.&quot; &quot;This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers&#x2014;to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.&quot; There have also been reports of North Korean military or police personnel traveling to join &quot;reconstruction efforts&quot; in occupied Donbas in early 2023 and plans to send military trainers in July this year. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-denies-north-korean-soldiers-are-fighting-in-ukraine-as-evidence-mounts/	2024-10-10T07:01:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1661935067.jpg
Second Russian Kinzhal missile carrier arrives in Belarus in 2 days, monitoring group says	A second Russian Mig-31K jet, capable of carrying Kinzhal missiles, landed in Belarus&apos; Machulishchy airport on Oct. 10, the Belarusian Hajun monitoring group reported. The first Russian MiG-31K interceptor aircraft landed at the Machulishchy airfield in Belarus on Oct. 9, for the first time since April 2023, when three Russian MiG-31Ks left the country and have not been spotted there since then. Both planes were spotted moving south at 3:10 p.m. local time, the group noted. It is unclear at the time of the publication whether they are being repositioned again or carrying out a maneuver. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. Moscow stationed several MiG-31K aircraft in Belarus after the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022, launching missiles at Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities from its airfields. Russia frequently lifts MiG-31K aircraft from airfields on its territory to attack Ukraine. The advanced air-launched Kinzhal missile is difficult to intercept and shoot down. They have an operational range of some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), which means that all of Ukraine is at risk if the missile is launched from Russian airspace. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said in January that air defenses had intercepted 25 out of 63 Kinzhal missiles since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/second-russian-kinzhal-missile-carrier-arrives-in-belarus/	2024-10-10T06:07:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1222402985.jpg
Russian attack on Kharkiv's outskirts injures 5	A Russian attack against the village of Cherkaska Lozova just north of Kharkiv on Oct. 10 injured five people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. No further details on the consequences of the attack were provided at the moment. Shortly before the announcement, the Air Force warned about launches of guided aerial bombs by Russian tactical aviation against Kharkiv Oblast. These bombs, feared by the Ukrainian military, are launched from beyond the range of Ukraine&apos;s air defenses and are effectively impossible to intercept. Cherkaska Lozova lies on the northern outskirts of the regional center, Kharkiv, and roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the front line. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely populated areas of the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kharkiv-oblast-village/	2024-10-10T05:44:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1513217350.jpg
New Ukrainian telecom company attracts largest foreign investment since full-scale war's start	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided $435 million long-term debt to Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell, a recently merged Ukrainian telecom company, to improve service quality, EBRD said on Oct. 10. This is the single biggest direct foreign investment in Ukrainian business since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. &quot;The project is expected to send a strong positive signal to investors,&quot; EBRD&apos;s statement read. Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell, the product of a historic merger of Datagroup-Volia and Lifecell, will receive $217.5 million from each organization. According to EBRD&apos;s statement, after the investment, Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell will deliver improved mobile connectivity to 10 million subscribers and provide faster and more reliable fixed broadband access to around 4 million homes. &quot;The telecoms sector has been essential to Ukraine&apos;s welfare and economic resilience since the war began,&quot; &#xA0;EBRD Vice President Mark Bowman said. &quot;This operation will result in a large and reliable telecommunications operator, important domestically, as well as a very significant international investment in the Ukrainian economy, which we are proud to be part of.&quot; Originally set up to help central and eastern Europe transiting to a market economy at the end of the Cold War, EBRD gives loans to strategically critical sectors in countries battered by war or economic hardships. IFC, a member of the World Bank, also invests in sectors in developing countries to fulfill basic humanitarian needs. According to Reuters estimates, EBRD has deployed a total of 4.65 billion euros ($5.16 billion) across 107 projects in Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s invasion in February 2022. Some 855 million euros were deployed so far this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-ukrainian-telecom-company-attracts-largest-foreign-investment/	2024-10-10T05:26:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1245736056.jpg

There are fears that if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House, the U.S. might scale down its support or push Kyiv toward peace at the cost of painful territorial concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-presents-victory-plan-to-starmer-meets-rutte/	2024-10-10T05:07:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Rutte-Starmer-Zelensky.jpeg
Unilever concludes sale of Russian, Belarusian business to local firm	Unilever concluded the sale of its business and four factories in Russia and Belarus for an undisclosed amount to Arnest Group, a Russian manufacturer, the company announced on Oct. 10. &quot;The completion of the sale ends Unilever Russia&apos;s presence in the country,&quot; the company said in a press release. Unilever is one of the world&apos;s leading suppliers of food, personal- and home care products. It owns over 400 brands and sells products in more than 190 countries, including Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Arnest Group earlier acquired Heineken&apos;s Russian business for the symbolic sum of one euro. According to sources cited by the Russian pro-state outlet RBK, its assets in Russia were valued at around 35-40 billion roubles ($393-$449 million), as opposed to Unilever&apos;s own valuation of 600 million euros ($663 million). Reuters reports that the Kremlin is insisting on a minimum 50% discount on exit deals involving companies from countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia. Unilever faced criticism earlier and was placed on the list of &quot;international sponsors of the war&quot; by Ukraine&apos;s National Corruption Prevention Agency (NACP) for not exiting Russia until now, despite promises to suspend imports and exports of its products to and from Russia at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The International Sponsors of War list, launched in the summer of 2022, is an initiative that seeks to turn public opinion against multinationals that stay in Russia and use public pressure to incentivize withdrawal. According to the agency, Unilever paid about $50 million in taxes to the Russian state budget in 2022, with its profit increasing from $61 million in 2021 to more than $117 million by 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/unilever-concludes-sale-of-russian-belarusian-business-to-local-firm/	2024-10-10T04:54:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1238294623.jpg
US tech firm Anduril announces selling drones after successful tests in Ukraine	U.S. defense tech company Anduril will begin selling small, autonomous drones after successfully testing them in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 10. According to Anduril, their new drones will be capable of flying for 40 minutes and covering a range of 20 kilometers (12 miles). Ukraine&apos;s front lines have become the hotbed of military innovation as they provide a setting for constant ongoing experimentation and combat testing since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war began in 2022, especially with drone technology. Dozens of Ukrainian and foreign startups test their product amid Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but only the foreign ones attract capital from investors. Anduril collected $1.5 billion at the beginning of August in the largest defense tech funding round ever publicized. Ukrainian defense startups struggle to attract foreign capital due to risks associated with the ongoing war and capital-flow regulations. Drones - lightweight aerial weapons capable of hovering, surveying an area, and delivering rapid, precise strikes&#x2014;offer a cost-effective and less vulnerable alternative to traditional fighter jets and other more expensive weapons systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/anduril-announces-selling-drones-after-successful-tests-in-ukraine/	2024-10-10T04:38:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2152503873.jpg
Almost 60 Russian aircraft based in targeted North Caucasus airbase, SBU source says	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian forces carried out a successful strike against Russia&apos;s Khanskaya military airfield in the Adygea Republic, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed on Oct. 10. The confirmation comes shortly after Adygea Republic authorities reported a drone attack against the region early on Oct. 10. The Russian Telegram news channel Astra wrote about explosions near the airfield the same morning. &quot;During the attack, 57 warplanes, trainer aircraft, and helicopters were based at the airfield. This included Su-34 and Su-35 jets and Mi-8 helicopters,&quot; a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. The damage inflicted to the aircraft is being determined, the source noted. According to the General Staff, the strike damaged an ammunition warehouse, resulting in a fire. The airfield is located near the village of Khanskaya, close to the region&apos;s capital city of Maykop, and roughly 270 (170 miles) kilometers east of occupied Crimea. The Khanskaya airfield is home to Russia&apos;s 272nd Training Aviation Regiment. The operation was carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, according to the SBU source and the General Staff.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-60-russian-aircraft-based-in-targeted-north-caucasus-airbase-sbu-source-says/	2024-10-10T03:50:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Maykop.jpg
Opinion: JD Vance’s neutrality pitch for Ukraine is a shortcut to Putin’s next invasion	Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance might consider himself a genius for proposing &#x201C;neutrality&#x201D; for Ukraine as the centerpiece of his plan to end Russia&#x2019;s war. For Vance, this appears to be a true eureka moment. Unfortunately, the concept of neutral status for Ukraine is not new. Vance may not realize it, but Ukraine effectively had neutral status in 2014. Until Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea and its initial invasion of Donbas that year, Ukraine maintained a non-aligned status, which implied neutrality. This neutral, or non-aligned, status failed to protect Ukraine. Instead, its military weakness and neutrality were a green light for Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex and invade Ukrainian territory. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine such a status would deter Putin from attacking again. The only assurance against further Russian aggression is a strong defense, ideally in alliance with Western partners. The obsolescence of neutrality in Europe is underscored by Finland and Sweden &#x2013; previous supporters of neutral status &#x2013; joining NATO after Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Before the war, this shift seemed impossible. Unlike Vance&#x2019;s starry-eyed view of Putin, Swedes and Finns have a clear-eyed understanding of the threat Russia poses to European security. History has proven that neutrality provides no defense, and it would offer Ukraine zero assurance that Russia wouldn&#x2019;t attack again. Vance also suggests that Ukraine can appease the threat from Russia by forgoing any ambition to join Western structures &#x2013; presumably NATO and the European Union. It&#x2019;s important to remind Vance that Ukraine had no real prospect of joining NATO in 2014 when Crimea was annexed. Opinion polls showed single-digit support for NATO membership, and NATO itself had little appetite for Ukraine&#x2019;s accession. Russia understood this but invaded anyway &#x2013; not out of fear of future NATO enlargement, but because Putin saw an opportunity to exploit Ukraine&apos;s weakness in a pure imperial land grab. FormerFormer US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (L) and US Senator from Ohio and Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance attend a remembrance ceremony on the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center at Ground Zero, in New York City on Sep. 11, 2024. (Adam Gray RAY / AFP via Getty Images)Putin has since openly stated that his invasion was about his refusal to accept Ukraine as a sovereign state or Ukrainians as distinct from Russians. For Putin, Russia and Ukraine are the same people and should be united. His invasion wasn&#x2019;t about NATO enlargement, which was never a reality &#x2013; it was about imperialism. Only in response to Russian aggression has Ukrainian support for NATO grown, out of necessity and a recognition that non-aligned status failed. Rejecting Ukraine&#x2019;s desire to join NATO, as Vance suggests, would bow to Russian bullying and reward aggression. It would likely encourage more expansionist policies from Russia. Ukrainian membership in NATO not only assures Ukraine&apos;s security but also strengthens Europe&#x2019;s defense. Ukraine&#x2019;s enhanced military capability, proven in battle, would be an asset to NATO. As for EU accession, if Vance also seeks to block Ukraine&#x2019;s membership, it reveals a deep misunderstanding of recent Ukrainian history. His plan seems rooted in outdated thinking &#x2013; that Ukraine&#x2019;s best position is to remain a bridge between East and West, as it did before 2014. Vance may have a romantic vision of a golden age of Ukrainian neutrality, but in reality, that status failed. It invited Russian aggression and stunted Ukraine&#x2019;s economic development, leaving it vulnerable to state capture by oligarchs, particularly those with ties to Russia. A key statistic Vance should consider is Ukraine&#x2019;s per capita GDP compared to Poland and Russia in 1991 &#x2013; around $3,000 for all three. By 2013, Poland and Russia had grown to nearly $14,000, while Ukraine remained stuck at just over $3,000. Poland chose the EU, Russia relied on commodities, and Ukraine was caught in a no-man&#x2019;s-land of corruption and stagnation. This instability led to two revolutions &#x2013; the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Euromaidan in 2013-14. By 2013, Ukraine had to choose: East or West. Ukrainians opted for the West, and Putin couldn&#x2019;t accept that, leading to war. Vance may not comprehend this, but Ukrainians do &#x2013; and I would argue Putin does as well. Returning to neutrality or non-alignment is a recipe for failure. Ukraine&#x2019;s economy would collapse, it would be unable to sustain a defense against Russia, and Vance&#x2019;s plan would pave the way for another Russian invasion. Economic failure would likely lead to political and social instability, creating risks for Europe. Imagine tens of millions of Ukrainians fleeing west, while Ukraine&#x2019;s military and security forces become destabilized. How would Europe confront such a security threat? Vance seems desperate to avoid a Russian defeat in Ukraine &#x2013; so much so that he&#x2019;s willing to offer Putin a win. But in doing so, he fails to grasp the consequences of his appeasement: future security risks to Europe and a weakening of the Western alliance, which even Vance should recognize as vital in the looming battle for hegemony with China.

Ukraine's parliament passes bill allowing foreigners to serve as officers in International Legion	The parliament adopted amendments to a law that would allow foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion to serve as officers, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on his Telegram channel on Oct. 10. Until now, volunteers could &#x43E;nly fight as privates or sergeants. &quot;The main idea is to allow foreigners to be recruited not only as soldiers and sergeants but also as officers,&quot; lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said earlier on his Telegram channel. Ukraine&apos;s International Legion was launched at the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attracting foreigners who volunteered to defend Ukraine. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. The unit was first formed under the Territorial Defense Forces but was later put under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces, with some units subordinate to the military intelligence agency (HUR). Initially lauded as a PR success, soon it was marred with scandals and stories about misconduct. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigation from 2022 revealed leadership misconduct in the unit, both in the parts led by military intelligence and those overseen by the Armed Forces. Recently, Poland opened a program to attract Ukrainians living in Poland to be trained by the Polish Forces. The formation of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland faced delays due to a low turnout of applicants.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-international-legion/	2024-10-10T03:00:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1643784979--2-.jpg
Oil depot in occupied Crimea's Feodosia burning for 4th day after Ukraine's strike	Russian emergency services were unable to extinguish a fire for the fourth day after it erupted at an oil depot in Russia-occupied Feodosia after a strike, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Crimean service reported on Oct. 10. Ukrainian missile forces targeted the largest oil depot in occupied Crimea in the early hours of Oct. 7, resulting in a large-scale fire. The Marine Oil Terminal is the largest facility for oil product handling in Crimea; the only other terminal of its kind on the peninsula is located in Sevastopol. As of Oct. 10, 1,137 people had been evacuated from the area, said Igor Tkachenko, the Russian-installed proxy head of Feodosia. &#x412; &#x424;&#x435;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x438;&#x438; &#x447;&#x435;&#x442;&#x432;&#x435;&#x440;&#x442;&#x44B;&#x435; &#x441;&#x443;&#x442;&#x43A;&#x438; &#x43F;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x436;&#x430;&#x435;&#x442;&#x441;&#x44F; &#x433;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x435; &#x440;&#x435;&#x437;&#x435;&#x440;&#x432;&#x443;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x432; &#x43D;&#x430; &#x43D;&#x435;&#x444;&#x442;&#x435;&#x431;&#x430;&#x437;&#x435;, &#x430;&#x442;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x439; &#x412;&#x421;&#x423; 7 &#x43E;&#x43A;&#x442;&#x44F;&#x431;&#x440;&#x44F;. &#x41F;&#x443;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x443;&#x435;&#x43C; &#x444;&#x43E;&#x442;&#x43E; &#x43D;&#x430;&#x448;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x440;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x434;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x430; pic.twitter.com/SeKqSHCJAx The authorities warned that the amount of water needed to extinguish the fire may also affect the quality and quantity of water supplies for the residents. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. Recently, a fire following a Ukrainian strike in the Kavkaz oil and petroleum storage facility just outside Proletarsk, a town in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, was extinguished after 11 days and injured 49 Russian firefighters.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-in-crimeas-feodosia-burning-for-4th-day-after-ukraines-strike/	2024-10-10T02:26:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Feodosia-1.jpeg
Opinion: Putin’s war? The case for Russia’s collective responsibility in Ukraine	Referring to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine simply as &#x201C;Putin&#x2019;s war&#x201D; is quite common, but this framing is misleading. It oversimplifies the invasion, affects allies&#x2019; perceptions, and fuels Russian propaganda. By focusing solely on the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, blame for this brutal aggression is shifted away from the Russian people. In reality, millions of Russians are driving and sustaining the war, which calls for a broader examination of collective responsibility. The concept of collective responsibility holds that a group or society can bear moral accountability for certain actions or harms, even if not every individual directly contributes. Applying this to the Russian invasion of Ukraine means acknowledging that the Russian population, along with its institutions, bears moral responsibility for the war, given the vast number of Russians who facilitate continued aggression daily. During a recent nationwide air attack on Ukraine, a husband and father in Lviv suffered an unimaginable loss &#x2013; his wife and three daughters were killed in a missile strike that destroyed their home. In an instant, his entire family was taken from him, leaving him to endure grief beyond words. Images of this tragedy flooded social media, serving as a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating human toll Russia&#x2019;s war continues to inflict on innocent civilians. While the blame for such horrific losses is quickly placed on Putin, these victims were not killed by him alone. The missile that struck their home was not designed and built by Putin. The fighter jet that delivered it was not fueled, maintained, or piloted by him. Putin did not prepare the meals for the military and support personnel. The uniforms they wore were not sewn by Putin. Behind every strike and offensive operation is a vast network of Russian civilians and military personnel. This network includes countless individuals involved in every aspect of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;special military operation,&#x201D; from complex missile launches to basic administration. These tasks are carried out by average Russians working in various sectors &#x2013; military, energy, manufacturing, food and agriculture, transportation, telecommunications, media.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Each industry is critical to sustaining a war of this scale, and each employs millions of Russians. These workers may not hold positions of power or directly participate in combat, yet they are essential to maintaining Russia&#x2019;s military efforts against Ukraine. To claim that these individuals are unaware of their roles defies belief, especially since many Russians justify their contributions to the war, citing economic necessity. For a Russian soldier, joining the armed forces is often seen as a job that provides money to support his family, the chance to receive a new car, or the opportunity to bring home a washing machine once used by a family in Ukraine. For a factory worker, overseeing the production of bullets that will be used against children in Ukraine is just another job. Russian social media is filled with such justifications, underscoring that these millions of individuals are fully aware of their roles in sustaining the war&apos;s destruction. This immoral behavior must not be normalized, as it contributes to the dangerous acceptance of violence and aggression among a large segment of the population. This widespread approval of &#x201C;justified&#x201D; violence, whether through direct or indirect participation, deepens moral corruption and presents significant challenges for societal rehabilitation once the war ends. By reducing the invasion to &#x201C;one man&#x2019;s doing and one man&#x2019;s problem,&#x201D; not only does the West fail to fully grasp the situation, but Russian propagandists also benefit by portraying war facilitators as victims and &quot;hostages&quot; of the regime. This distortion of reality, promoted by both the state and opposition, allows Russia to whitewash its image, evade the topic of collective responsibility, and create further distraction and confusion in efforts to end the war and seek justice. By demanding collective responsibility from Russia, we can dismantle the increasingly popular narrative of &#x201C;Russians as innocent victims&#x201D; and acknowledge the active role millions of Russians play in sustaining the war. This shift broadens the focus from Putin alone to the millions contributing to the brutal aggression.

Zelensky meets Starmer during visit to UK	Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the U.K. on Oct. 10, meeting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Downing Street. Zelensky&apos;s visit will include talks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and is part of a broader European tour, which began on Oct. 9 with a visit to Croatia. The Ukrainian president is meeting Western leaders in lieu of a postponed Ramstein-format summit that was to be held on Oct. 12. The allied gathering, where Zelensky was initially expected to pitch his country&apos;s victory plan, was delayed after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his overseas travel to handle Hurricane Milton. Starmer greeted Zelensky in Downing Street before starting bilateral talks, the topics of which had not been made public. One of the issues that may be discussed includes Kyiv&apos;s request for permission to strike deep inside Russian territory with British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, the BBC reported. Multiple reports suggest that London favors easing restrictions on long-range strikes but awaits a decision from Washington, whose technology is necessary for the launch of Storm Shadow missiles against Russian soil. Zelensky&apos;s tour will continue with visits to France, Italy, and Germany in an effort to ramp up support across the continent ahead of the uncertain U.S. election. Ukraine faces an increasingly difficult situation, with Russian forces steadily pushing forward along the eastern front and growing anxieties over energy deficits in the coming winter. There are fears that if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House, the U.S. might scale down its support or force Kyiv toward peace at the cost of painful territorial concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-starmer-during-visit-to-uk/	2024-10-10T01:49:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177726362.jpg
Ukraine's parliament approves 'historic' tax hike	The Ukrainian parliament on Oct. 10 adopted a bill on a major tax increase as the country struggles to shore up its budget deficit amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war. The bill, which was passed in the first reading on Sept. 17, aimed to increase taxes by Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025. According to opposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, the version of the bill approved by 247 lawmakers in the second reading saw several changes. An amendment to the legislation left the military tax &#x2013; &#xA0;a sum levied from citizens to support the war effort &#x2013; for military personnel at 1.5%. One of the provisions of the bill is an increase in military tax from 1.5% to 5%. In turn, another 10-page amendment that represented &quot;half of the law&quot; was removed, Zhelezniak said, saying that the legislation in its current form is problematic from the legal point of view. The approved legislation increases the military tax on individuals&apos; income to 5% retrospectively since Oct. 1 and on other individuals&apos; incomes since Jan. 1, 2025. It also introduces a military tax for self-employed persons and increases profit taxes for banks to 50% for 2024 and other financial institutions from 18% to 25% since January next year. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in August that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though foreign partners have pledged to cover roughly $20 billion of that sum. Kyiv has grown increasingly reliant on external sources of financing, such as grants and loans from the EU, the U.S., the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other partners as Russia&apos;s war continues to put heavy strain on the country&apos;s economy. The proposed tax increase is part of an effort to find additional sources of funding at home, which may also include increased domestic borrowing and measures to boost the number of jobs and wages. Despite the dire budgetary situation, the bill has received criticism due to its potential repercussions on already difficult living conditions in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-approves-historic-tax-hike/	2024-10-10T01:24:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
Ukraine, Croatia sign bilateral agreement, vow to bolster defense cooperation	President Volodymyr Zelensky and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic signed a bilateral agreement on support and cooperation on Oct. 9, the Presidential Office said. This is the 27th bilateral agreement signed between Ukraine and a partner country since a joint G7 declaration during a NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023. The agreement covered cooperation between defense industries and Croatian assistance in demining, as well as a strong condemnation of Russia&#x2019;s war, calling it &quot;unprovoked, unjustified, and illegal.&quot; &quot;Croatia remains unwavering in its commitment to supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; the agreement read. Croatia also offered its support and expertise in providing care for veterans and prosecuting war crimes. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Croatia has provided Ukraine with 300 million euros ($330 million) in assistance, including 11 defense packages. Zelensky arrived in Croatia to participate in the Southeast Europe Summit, where he held bilateral negotiations with leaders of Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, and Slovenia. Parties of the summit accepted a joint declaration that repeated their commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and condemned Russia&apos;s aggression in the &quot;strongest possible terms.&quot; Zelensky is scheduled to meet with the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy within the next day, as the Ramstein-format meeting in Germany was postponed after U.S. President Joe Biden had canceled his overseas travel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-croatia-bilateral-agreement/	2024-10-10T00:47:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-Croatia-1.jpeg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 34 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured at least 34 over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 10. Russia launched a missile attack against port infrastructure in the Odesa district on Oct. 9, hitting a Panama-flagged civilian vessel and killing seven people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Eleven people were injured. This was the third Russian attack against a civilian vessel in the last four days. Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast injured at least two people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. An 82-year-old woman was hospitalized following a Russian drone strike against the city of Kryvyi Rih that hit a five-story residential building. Six people were evacuated from the damaged building. A 45-year-old man was injured the same morning when Russian forces hit the territory of an agricultural enterprise in the Synelnykove district. One civilian was injured in Donetsk Oblast after Russia attacked the village of Yasna Poliana, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A school, two administrative buildings, several houses, and other buildings were damaged in the region. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast injured six people, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. An 81-year-old woman was injured during an attack against Kharkiv that damaged a 12-story residential building. A 65-year-old man was injured in the town of Kupiansk, a 76-year-old woman and two 54-year-old men were wounded in the village of Kozacha Lopan, and a 49-year-old man was injured in the village of Zelenyi Hai. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and 10 injured over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. A high-rise building, six houses, a utility company, educational and medical institutions, and other buildings were damaged. Four people were injured in a Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 10, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Several houses were destroyed. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Sumy oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-96/	2024-10-10T00:31:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-10_09-00-13.jpg
Experts urge setting up 'NATO bank' to 'Trump-proof' alliance, Guardian reports	German and British think tanks urged decision-makers to set up a &quot;NATO bank&quot; to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the alliance&apos;s military spending in a report published on Oct. 9 and seen by The Guardian. Allies need to prepare because if Donald Trump wins next month&#x2019;s presidential election, he could swiftly reduce U.S. defense spending in Europe, push for a peace deal in Ukraine that cedes parts of its territory to Russia, and potentially withdraw from NATO altogether, the joint report The New Diplomacy Project and the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation was quoted as saying by The Guardian. To reduce the potential impact of a second Trump presidency, NATO countries should back the establishment of a multilateral lending institution, effectively a NATO bank, the report suggests. This could &quot;save nations millions on essential equipment purchases, offer low interest rates on loans to alliance members, and introduce a new line of financing with longer repayment timeframes,&quot; the report said. Recently, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump criticized Washington&apos;s involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is &quot;stuck&quot; and will only be able to &quot;get out&quot; if he wins the election. Earlier this September, during a presidential debate with Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war. The report highlights additional threats a Trump victory could bring, including a collapse in diplomatic communication between the U.S. and Europe, as well as the withdrawal of U.S. troops and military assets from the continent.	https://kyivindependent.com/experts-urge-setting-up-nato-bank-to-trump-proof-alliance-guardian-reports/	2024-10-09T23:46:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173788651.jpg
Russia responsible for 80% of foreign influence operations in the world, Czech FM says	Russia is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague on Oct. 9. &quot;Russia is currently responsible for 80% of influence operations in the world. This is four times more than the rest of the world combined,&quot; Lipavsky said. According to Lipavsky, Europe needs to gear up its vigilance to counter such threats. &quot;We need much more determination in the fight against Kremlin influence than we have shown so far. The solution lies in strategic communication, sanctions, exposing crimes, and utilizing existing legal measures,&quot; Lipavsky said. Earlier this week, senior U.S. intelligence officials warned of malign influence campaigns ramping up in the U.S. by their adversaries ahead of the Nov. 5 elections. U.S. intelligence officials reported that Russia continues to actively run influence campaigns aimed at boosting former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump while undermining the campaign of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. In August, Mali and Niger severed their diplomatic ties with Ukraine due to what is suspected to be Russian influence in the two countries. Apart from countering Russian foreign influence in Europe, the Czech Republic is also expected to deliver at least half a million shells to Ukraine by the end of this year within a framework of a Czech-led procurement called the &quot;Czech ammunition initiative.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-responsible-for-80-of-foreign-influence-operations-in-the-world-czech-fm-says/	2024-10-09T23:02:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1944085433.jpg
Russia claims downing over 90 Ukrainian drones amid reports of airbase strike	Russian forces shot down 92 Ukrainian drones launched overnight on Oct. 10, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed amid mounting reports of successful strikes against Russian military targets. The majority of the drones &#x2013; 47 &#x2013; were allegedly intercepted over Krasnodar Krai in southwestern Russia, where only a day prior, Ukraine reportedly hit a base storing 400 Shahed-type drones. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev did not report on the attacks against his region on Oct. 10 10 at the time of the publication. At the same time, local authorities in Russia&apos;s Adygea Republic, an enclave within Krasnodar Krai, reported a drone attack &quot;against the suburb of (the capital) of Maykop by (Ukrainian) drones.&quot; Residents of the village of Rodnikovoye are reportedly being evacuated. There were no casualties, and a resulting fire is being extinguished, Governor Murat Kumpilov claimed. The governor&apos;s statement comes shortly after the Russian Telegram channel Astra wrote that in the early morning hours of Oct. 10, drones attacked the Khanskaya military airfield in Russia&apos;s Adygea Republic. The airfield is located near the village of Khanskaya, close to the region&apos;s capital city of Maykop, and roughly 270 (170 miles) kilometers east of occupied Crimea. The Khanskaya airfield is home to Russia&apos;s 272nd Training Aviation Regiment. 0:00/1&#xD7;Explosions heard in the background in Russia&apos;s Adygea Republic in the early hours on Oct. 10, 2024. (Astra/Telegram)The Russian Defense Ministry did not mention any drones intercepted over the Adygea Republic. Instead, twelve more drones were shot down over Kursk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, four over Bryansk Oblast, two over Belgorod Oblast, and one over Voronezh Oblast, the Defense Ministry claimed. All the above-mentioned regions lie at Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine and are often targeted in cross-border attacks. Fifteen more drones were allegedly downed over the Azov Sea, and two over Russian-occupied Crimea. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities.

General Staff: Russia has lost 665,200 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 665,200 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 10. This number includes 1,080 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,945 tanks, 17,765 armored fighting vehicles, 26,314 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,263 artillery systems, 1,225 multiple launch rocket systems, 976 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,767 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-665-200-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-09T22:14:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166158560.jpg
White House has 'serious concerns' about alleged Trump-Putin calls	The Biden administration has &quot;serious concerns&quot; about reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump held secret phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House press secretary and senior adviser Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing on Oct. 9. Putin and Trump spoke up to seven times after the latter left office in 2020, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Oct. 8, citing a book by journalist Bob Woodward. The two allegedly spoke even as Trump was reportedly pressuring Republicans to block the $60 billion aid package for Kyiv. &quot;Do we have serious concerns? &#xA0;Yes, if it is true,&quot; Jean-Pierre said on Oct. 9, noting that she could not confirm that any of the calls took place. &quot;Let&apos;s not forget, it is concerning, especially when we know the former president was lobbying against more aid for Ukraine &#x2014; to Ukraine to defend themselves against Russia&apos;s aggression,&quot; she said. As Trump seeks re-election this November, his views on Ukraine continue to divide Republicans and alarm Ukraine&apos;s allies. Trump has criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky for failing to &apos;make a deal&apos; with Russia and has refused to say outright that he supports a Ukrainian victory. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump&apos;s opponent in the upcoming vote, has lambasted Trump for his admiration of Putin and other dictators. Woodward&apos;s book, &quot;War,&quot; alleges that in early 2024, Trump ordered an aide out of his office at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to hold a phone call with Putin. Trump also allegedly secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test devices for personal use at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In a phone conversation with Trump, the Russian president asked his U.S. counterpart not to publicly disclose this information. &quot;I don&apos;t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,&quot; Putin told Trump, according to the book. The Trump campaign has denied the reports, calling them &quot;made up.&quot; While Jean-Pierre did not confirm the calls, she said that such conversations would pose a threat to Ukrainian and U.S. security. &#xA0; &quot;(I)f it is true, it is indeed concerning, because we&apos;re talking about our national security here,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-has-serious-concerns-about-alleged-trump-putin-calls/	2024-10-09T21:45:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1202252353.jpg
Drones hit military airfield in Russia's Republic of Adygea, Russian media claims	Drones attacked the Khanskaya military airfield in Russia&apos;s Republic of Adygea in the early hours of Oct. 10, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported. The airfield is located near the village of Khanskaya, close to the region&apos;s capital city of Maykop. Residents said that drones attacked the airbase in the night, Astra reported. According to NASA&apos;s fire monitoring program, a fire was recorded at the site following the attack. Local authorities have not commented on the alleged strike. The Khanskaya airfield is home to Russia&apos;s 272nd Training Aviation Regiment, according to Astra. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a drone attack against the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Oct. 3, according to a source in the SBU.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-hit-military-airfield-in-russias-republic-of-adygea-russian-media-claims/	2024-10-09T21:06:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163787441.jpg
Ukraine can hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months, US officials say	Ukrainian forces will be able to hold seized territory in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast for several months or longer, according to U.S. assessments, senior U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Oct. 9. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. According to senior U.S. officials, the U.S. assesses that Ukraine can continue to hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months to come. The reliable flow of supplies into the region and Russia&apos;s focus on advances in eastern Ukraine are key factors, officials told Bloomberg, speaking on the condition of anonymity. After enduring months of dire ammunition shortages, Ukrainian troops are now receiving a steady supply of shells, the officials said. Allied efforts to bolster Kyiv&apos;s artillery ammunition stores have helped improve the supply chain. A Czech-led ammunition initiative is already making deliveries and aims to send Ukraine 80,000 to 100,000 rounds per month until the end of this year. Russia&apos;s counteroffensive in Kursk Oblast has also not yet ousted Ukrainian troops from the region. The Ukrainian military claimed on Sept. 18 that the counterattack had stopped, with Russia only regaining a handful of settlements. Moscow is instead concentrating on its grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, closing in on the Donetsk Oblast cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that the Kursk incursion succeeded in drawing some Russian troops away from Ukraine&apos;s front lines, but that it is &quot;too early to judge&quot; the overall success of the operation. Zelensky also maintains that the offensive has helped Ukrainian prisoners of war by replenishing the country&apos;s &quot;exchange fund,&quot; enabling prisoner swaps with Russia. The seizure of Russian territory is meant to improve Ukraine&apos;s bargaining position in future peace talks, Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, said on Aug. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-can-hold-territory-in-kursk-oblast-for-months-us-officials-say/	2024-10-09T20:21:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
More weapons for Ukraine in 2014 could have prevented full-scale war, Stoltenberg says	NATO allies could have done more to arm Ukraine in 2014, potentially averting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with Politico published Oct. 9. Stoltenberg stepped down as NATO Secretary General on Oct. 1 after serving in the role for 10 years. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte now leads the alliance. At the end of his term, Stoltenberg cited the insufficient response to Russian aggression in 2014 as his major regret. &quot;I continue to believe that if we had armed Ukraine more after 2014, we might have prevented Russia from invading &#x2014; at least we would have increased the threshold for a full-scale invasion,&quot; he told Politico. Stoltenberg pointed out that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine did not begin with the 2022 invasion but with Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea and the Donbas war in 2014. &quot;I worked hard to try to convince NATO allies to do more, to provide more military support, more training,&quot; Stoltenberg said. &quot;Some allies did, but it was relatively limited, and that was very difficult for many years because the policy in NATO was that NATO should not provide lethal support to Ukraine.&quot; A greater willingness and more coordinated effort from member nations to send military aid to Kyiv may have deterred Russia, Stoltenberg speculated &quot;If we had delivered a fraction of the weapons we have delivered after 2022, we may have actually prevented the war,&quot; he said. Stoltenberg said there were &quot;some parallels&quot; to NATO&apos;s past red lines and the current restrictions some member states have placed on which weapons they will send Ukraine and how Ukraine can use them. The debate over the use of Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia reflects contemporary divisions among NATO allies as to how best to support Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;According to international law, Ukraine has the right to self-defense, and the right to self-defense includes the right to strike legitimate military targets on the territory of the aggressor, Russia,&quot; Stoltenberg said. &quot;I welcome that some allies have no restrictions, except it has to be within the limits of international law. And others have actually loosened their restrictions on the use of weapons.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/more-weapons-for-ukraine-in-2014-could-have-prevented-full-scale-war-stoltenberg-says/	2024-10-09T19:03:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161534889.jpg
Russian losses in war against Ukraine top 600,000, Pentagon says	Russia has sustained over 600,000 casualties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Defense News reported on Oct. 9, citing senior Pentagon officials. The figure comes at a particularly deadly stage of the war for Russian troops. According to reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, September was the second-most lethal month for Russian soldiers since February 2022. The accelerating losses are disproportionate with Moscow&apos;s territorial gains, a senior U.S. defense official said on Oct. 9. &quot;Russian losses, again both killed and wounded in action, in just the first year of the war exceeded the total of all Soviet losses in any conflict since World War II combined,&quot; the official said. The mounting casualties at the front may hinder the Russian military&apos;s recruitment efforts, the official said, putting pressure on the Kremlin to initiate a new wave of mobilization. Russian President Vladimir Putin has avoided announcing a larger mobilization campaign due to its deep unpopularity in Russia. The military has instead resorted to recruiting convicts, mobilizing young conscripts, and luring soldiers with higher pay and benefits. Russia may also receive troop support from North Korea, which might begin deploying regular units to Ukraine, South Korea&apos;s Defense Minister said on Oct. 8. As casualties climb, Russian forces continue to press on in eastern Ukraine, focusing on the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Ukrainian troops on Oct. 2 withdrew from the embattled city of Vuhledar amid a heavy Russian assault. The Ukrainian military reported that Russia tried to capture the town &quot;at any cost&quot; by sending reserves to attack its flanks, exhausting defending Ukrainian units. Russia&apos;s elite Marine units suffered four times higher losses during a year of fighting near Vuhledar than during 10 years of the Second Chechen War, the BBC News Russia reported on Oct. 4. Another senior U.S. military official told Defense News that Moscow would likely continue relying on superior numbers to force incremental gains, despite the body count. &quot;It&apos;s kind of the Russian way of war where they continue to throw mass into the into the problem, and I think we&apos;ll continue to see high losses,&quot; the official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-war-against-ukraine-top-600-000-pentagon-says/	2024-10-09T18:17:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608183.jpg
Russia's missile attack on Odesa Oblast kills 6, injures 11	At least six people were killed and 11 injured in a Russian missile strike on Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Odesa Oblast on Oct. 9, regional governor Oleh Kiper reported on Telegram. Russian forces targeted a Panama-flagged civilian container ship Shui Spirit, according to Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. &quot;Today, Ukraine remains the guarantor of food security. Therefore, it is important to stop the practice of this terror - with sufficient weapons, air defense, diplomacy, sanctions, and punishment for every war crime, Kuleba added. Odesa Oblast Governor Kiper said that all victims are citizens of Ukraine. At least seven people are in serious condition and receive treatment at local hospitals. The Oct. 9 incident marks the third attack in four days, according to Ukrainian authorities. Kiper accused Russia of attempting to disrupt Ukraine&#x2019;s maritime food corridor, which Kyiv established in August 2023 after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July. &quot;I urge all states and organizations to condemn Russian attacks and take action to stop the aggressor, ensure freedom of navigation and global food security,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-missile-attack-on-odesa-oblast-kills-6-injures-11/	2024-10-09T15:50:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/462195988_834319535541859_4905573654116758528_n.jpg
EU approves 35-billion-euro loan for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets	European Union countries have approved an unprecedented plan to issue a 35-billion-euro ($37.2 billion) loan to support Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy, using Russia&apos;s immobilized Central Bank assets as collateral. The deal is part of a broader G7 initiative to provide &#x20AC;45 billion ($50 billion) in aid to Kyiv, struggling to counter a renewed Russian offensive that has severely damaged its power infrastructure. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year. The agreement, reached on Oct. 9 by EU ambassadors, follows Hungary&apos;s announcement that it would block a key sanctions reform until after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The proposed amendment will extend the renewal period for sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets&#x2014;valued at around &#x20AC;210 billion across the EU&#x2014;from six months to 36 months. Unlike the loan, which passed by a qualified majority, changes to sanctions laws require unanimous approval. &quot;We believe that this issue should be decided &#x2013; the prolongation of the Russian sanctions &#x2013; after the US elections. That was the Hungarian position,&quot; Hungary&apos;s finance minister Mihaly Varga said on Oct. 8 following a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg, according to Euronews. The longer renewal period aims to make the project more predictable and address concerns raised by G7 allies, particularly the U.S., which fears that a single EU member could block sanctions, unfreeze assets, and disrupt the entire plan. These fears are mainly directed at Hungary, known for blocking sanctions in exchange for controversial concessions. According to the G7 plan, profits generated by the frozen assets will be used to gradually repay the money loaned to Ukraine. If these profits are no longer accessible, the West will be responsible for covering the costs.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-approves-35-billion-euro-loan-for-ukraine-using-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-09T13:44:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Ukraine hits Russian base storing Shahed drones in Krasnodar Krai, military claims	Ukraine&apos;s military struck a base storing Iranian Shahed-type drones Russia uses for daily attacks against Ukraine near the village of Oktyabrsky in Russia&apos;s Kranodar Krai on Oct. 9, the General Staff reported. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the all-out war. Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 1,300 such drones in September, launching them on a daily basis for an entire month. About 400 attack drones were reportedly stored at the Russian base. According to the statement, the attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Navy and units of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The subsequent detonation was recorded after the attack, the General Staff said. &quot;According to the results of objective control, an accurate hit on the target was recorded,&quot; the military said, without elaborating on the scale of the damage. &quot;The destruction of the Shahed drones storage base will significantly reduce the ability of the Russian occupiers to terrorize civilians in Ukrainian cities and villages,&quot; the General Staff added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Overnight on Oct. 9, a Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported. &quot;According to available information, missiles and artillery weapons, including those that came from North Korea, as well as guided aerial bombs, were stored on the territory of the warehouse,&quot; it said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russian-base-storing-shahed-drones-in-krasnodar-krai-military-claims/	2024-10-09T12:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — The fight over higher taxes continues	The following is the Oct. 8, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Public reactions, particularly from the business community, to increasing taxes continue to mount as the bill makes its way through the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. Where the law&#x2019;s at: Ukraine&#x2019;s parliamentary Tax Committee approved a draft law on increasing taxes after it passed in the first reading last week. The draft law&#x2019;s key provisions haven&#x2019;t changed, lawmaker and committee member Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. Among those provisions are an increase of the added military tax from 1.5% to 5%, higher taxes for self-employed people, a 50% tax on bank profits, and a 25% tax on financial institutions. The draft law will be considered in parliament for a second reading this week. Over 1,388 amendments have been submitted, according to Zhelezniak. As a reminder: The country is facing a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and as Russia&#x2019;s war continues in its third year with no end in sight, the country needs to find funding to keep its economy afloat and finance its war effort. What they&#x2019;re saying: Ajax Systems founder and well-known business figure in Ukraine Aleksandr Konotopskyi has taken to social media, calling on the government to do more to go after corrupt businesses that evade taxes. &#x201C;It would be better if you left the economy alone. While there is still something left to leave alone at all,&#x201D; Konotopskyi said in a Facebook post. In comments to Forbes, investment fund Dragon Capital head Tomas Fiala agreed with Konotopskyi, saying that the government has done too little too late to raise the necessary funds to finance the country and its defense. &#x201C;The government needs to do its part and finally show zero tolerance for corruption, shut down the shadow economy, and make sure everyone pays their fair share of taxes,&#x201D; he told Forbes. Fiala believes the best way to increase taxes would be through increasing the value-added tax &#x2014; an idea supported by the Finance Ministry and International Monetary Fund but rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s office and Cabinet of Ministers. Other business people interviewed by Forbes echoed these sentiments and called on the government to focus on reforms, particularly in customs. A law reforming the sector was recently passed in parliament and is waiting to be signed by the president. Pushing through customs reform may have been a way for the government to quell some of the concerns of business, although not to much avail. &#x201C;It is not necessary to raise taxes for white businesses but to fight the more than 40% of those who work in the shadows. They have a competitive advantage due to tax evasion,&#x201D; Oleksandr Sokolovsky, CEO of fabrics maker Textile-Contact.

(Serhii Korovayny/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Ukraine wants foreign observers near nuclear plantsAs the cold season sets in and fears rise that Russia is planning to go after Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear power plants &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s main energy source &#x2014; Kyiv says it has put forth an idea to place international observers near its three operational nuclear plants. An Energy Ministry official said at an event in Kyiv last week that as Russia gears up to attack the infrastructure, like the substations connecting the plants to the country&#x2019;s power grid, observers around the plants could help ensure their safety. The idea may be far-fetched and so far, the agency has made no public indication it will send anyone. Ukraine&#x2019;s ask isn&apos;t without grounds &#x2014; Russia already attacked substations near Ukraine&#x2019;s western Rivne nuclear power plant at the end of August, causing blackouts, and recently, on Oct. 1, substations connected to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, cutting off a power line to the facility.

(Strategic Industries Ministry of Ukraine)AeroVironment to produce kamikaze drones in UkraineThe U.S.-based AeroVironment signed an agreement with a Ukrainian company to localize its production of Switchblade 600 loitering munitions, marking the latest of several recent agreements between Ukrainian and foreign companies to produce weaponry in Ukraine. The Ukrainian company was not named because of security reasons. The agreement was signed on Oct. 1 during the DFNC2 International Defense Industries Forum in Kyiv, where nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries attended. The Switchblade 600 is a loitering munition used to strike targets by crashing into them. They have a flight range of 40 kilometers or more and can stay in the air for over 40 minutes. Brett Hush, a senior vice president at AeroVironment who signed the agreement in Kyiv, praised the Switchblade&apos;s performance, adding that &quot;with the support and feedback from Ukraine, it&apos;ll be even better.&quot; Read more here. Screen shot from a video about the village home that Ukrainian vlogger Olenka Namaliui purchased to renovate in 2023. (YouTube)Demand for rural homes growing in UkraineUkrainians are increasingly moving from cities to rural areas, as they seek more space and security, Liga.net reported. Demand for rural housing started to rise during the Covid-19 pandemic and has only increased since the start of the full-scale invasion. Contrary to high-rise apartment buildings, individual homes can run on alternative energy sources, insulating them from blackouts. According to Liga.net, demand has increased sharply in the country&#x2019;s central regions, which includes the Kyiv area, recovering to 2021 pre-war levels. Housing prices in the Kyiv region have increased 50%, Liga.net said. Instead of buying new homes, Ukrainians are opting to renovate older houses as it&#x2019;s more affordable. In line with the trend, several bloggers have cropped up on social media in the country offering tips on rural home renovations. Ukraine&#x2019;s government is planning on introducing a model of what&#x2019;s called &#x201C;economic reservation&#x201D; to protect certain employees from mobilization. While some people are already protected from military service (energy sector workers, for example), the move would increase the number of those eligible for reservation. The issue is extremely sensitive and divisive, and questions remain about how people across society, particularly those serving, will react. The new energy hub envisages the use of existing gas storage facilities and cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a press conference with his Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico on Oct. 7. The EU is considering allowing member states to make voluntary contributions to the European Peace Facility, bypassing the need for unanimous support to disburse funding to Ukraine, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed officials familiar with the matter. The bulker attacked on Oct. 6 was loaded with about 6,000 tons of Ukrainian corn intended for export, the Infrastructure Ministry said. The ship&#x2019;s owner, Greece-based AK shipping, confirmed Russia had attacked the ship. Nonetheless, foreign traders have injected only 0.5 billion cubic meters of gas into Ukraine&#x2019;s gas storage facilities, down from 2.5 billion cubic meters in 2023, Naftogaz CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Oct. 4. The country launched an e-residency program last week, giving citizens of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Slovenia remote access to services in the country, mainly the ability to open a business and bank account and pay taxes at a favorable rate.

Zelensky to meet with UK, Germany, Italy, France leaders within next day	President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning to meet with the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy within the next day, he said at a press conference in Croatia on Oct.9. Zelensky will hold talks with key partners on whom the military component of Ukraine&apos;s strengthening depends, the president said. &quot;I will meet separately in each country with the leaders of Britain, France, and Germany. I will try to be swift, and then I will present the victory plan to all our partners at Ramstein,&quot; he added. The five-point plan was presented to Biden during Zelensky&apos;s trip to the U.S. in late September. Kyiv was planning to unveil it to other leaders at the Ramstein-format meeting in Germany later this week, but the summit was postponed after U.S. President Joe Biden had canceled his overseas travel. As part of his European tour, Zelensky is expected to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin on Oct. 10, Reuters reported, citing two unnamed sources. Ukraine&apos;s president will also meet Pope Francis, who was previously criticized for controversial remarks on Russia and calls for Ukraine to raise the white flag.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-with-uk-germany-italy-france-leaders-within-next-day/	2024-10-09T11:34:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173571774.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian weapons depot storing North Korean shells, missiles set ablaze after drone attack, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 9: A Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. &quot;According to available information, missiles and artillery weapons, including those that came from North Korea, as well as guided aerial bombs, were stored on the territory of the warehouse,&quot; it said in a post on Telegram. &quot;A significant number were located under the open sky.&quot; The General Staff said the depot was the 67th Arsenal of Russia&#x2019;s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU), located near the city of Karachev. Earlier on Oct. 9, the Telegram channel Astra said a warehouse in Bryansk Oblast had been attacked, and local residents reported air raid sirens in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 9. Videos accompanying Astra&#x2019;s post showed multiple, quick-fire explosions coming from the area of a large fire. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 9 that 47 Ukrainian drones had been shot down overnight, including 24 in Bryansk Oblast. It did not report any damage or casualties. The next summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) scheduled for Oct. 12 in Germany was postponed after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his overseas travel to handle Hurricane Milton, AFP reported on Oct. 9, citing a statement by the Ramstein Air Base. Biden was supposed to convene a first leader-level meeting of the Ramstein summit in Germany weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, where President Volodymyr Zelensky was expected to present his victory plan. The U.S. president put off his visits to Germany and Angola in order to oversee the emergency response to Hurricane Milton, according to the White House&apos;s spokesperson. No new date for the summit was announced. &quot;Announcements about future Ukraine Defense Contact Group meetings will be forthcoming,&quot; the statement read. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. Zelensky already presented his five-point plan to Biden during his trip to the U.S. in late September. Ukraine&apos;s president also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. The situation on the battlefield calls for decisive action to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine &quot;no later than in 2025,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his visit to Croatia on Oct. 9. &quot;In October, November and December we have a real chance to move things toward peace and lasting stability. The situation on the battlefield creates an opportunity to make this choice &#x2014; the choice for decisive action to end the war no later than in 2025,&quot; Zelensky said. Speaking at the &quot;Ukraine - South East Europe&quot; summit, he added that Kyiv is counting on the leadership of U.S. President Joe Biden as well as &quot;strong and wise steps&quot; from the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy &quot;to bring security and peace to Europe.&quot; Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come days after Ukrainian forces withdrew from Vuhledar, one of the key strongholds of Ukraine&apos;s defense of southern Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces have been also focusing their efforts against the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Kyiv has been working on the points of peace formula since July and is going to finish a document peace framework by November while preparing for the second peace summit, according to Zelensky. Next to this, Ukraine developed a victory plan &quot;that can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot; &quot;When the plan is fully implemented, Russia will lose the ability to threaten Europe,&quot; Zelensky said. The French military is training and equipping Ukraine&apos;s Anne de Kyiv brigade in France, the first instance of a foreign country training a Ukrainian brigade on its territory, the French Embassy in Kyiv said on Oct. 9. A total of 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers are being trained by the French Armed Forces in the northeastern Grand Est region, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and his French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, are expected to meet with some of the 15,000 Ukrainian troops that Paris has trained since the full-scale Russian invasion. &quot;France is the first country to train a full-fledged Ukrainian brigade on its territory. This initiative is unparalleled in terms of the number of trained soldiers and the duration of the training,&quot; the statement read. Under the new program, Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in France, as well as Poland. The training recreates real conditions of combat operations, involving French equipment that will be handed over to the Ukrainian military, according to the embassy. The training includes armored battle using AMX10 RC wheeled tanks and Milan missiles, air defense using Mistral missiles, as well as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, snipers, and Caesar artillery systems. In June, Macron unveiled that Paris would provide Kyiv with an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5 planes to boost its airpower. The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. &quot;The training of pilots is part of the ongoing transfer of AASM and SCALP air-to-ground weaponry,&quot; the embassy said. Ukraine received two IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems from Berlin last week, German Major General Christian Freuding said in an interview with the news outlet RND published Oct. 9. Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sept. 4, on top of the seven other systems that have already been delivered. Ukraine will receive two more by the end of the year, Freuding said. By 2026, Ukraine should receive 24 IRIS-T systems from Germany &#x2014; 12 of medium-range versions and 12 short-range &#x2014; it was reported last month. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-34/	2024-10-09T11:33:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-11_34_33-1-1.png
‘Time is currency,’ constrained US congressional trips to Ukraine stymie diplomatic efforts	A series of logistical constraints on U.S. Congressional members&#x2019; travel to Ukraine is increasingly raising worries about the effectiveness of American diplomacy to Kyiv, members of Congress and Congressional advisors told the Kyiv Independent. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, members of the U.S. Congress have displayed their allied support with consistent visits to Kyiv, journeys that are typically widely photographed. But citing security concerns, the U.S. State Department does not permit representatives or congressional staff to stay overnight in Ukraine on official congressional travel or to leave Kyiv. This means representatives have to fly into western Poland from Washington, take an overnight train into Kyiv, and leave for Poland before nightfall on another overnight train after about seven hours of work time. With restrictions limiting the diplomacy these lawmakers are able to engage with in Kyiv and deterring others from visiting altogether, concerns are mounting that the safety protocols are limiting the potential expansion of support for Kyiv in Washington. With the American presidential election less than a month away and a Republican ticket lead by former President Donald Trump that has expressed skepticism in further support of Ukraine, advocates and lawmakers say the most effective way to ensure Congress allows further aid to Kyiv is for members of Congress to be able to take longer trips to Kyiv. And the more politicized questions of aid to Ukraine become in the elections, worries have set in that the ideal window for the most effective bi-partisan diplomacy in Ukraine passed without being fully seized before the election&#x2019;s imminence set in this past summer. &#x201C;It&apos;s ridiculous,&#x201D; Rep. Jimmy Panetta, who has made numerous visits to Kyiv, said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s great to show the people of Ukraine that we support them, but it&apos;s not great for members of Congress to actually get a true education and evidentiary experience when it comes to building this argument and the support necessary for Ukraine.&#x201D; Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., speaks during the news conference on the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act in the U.S. Capitol on July 28, 2022. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)More representatives, especially those not fully in support of Ukraine, would be willing to go to Ukraine if it wasn&#x2019;t for these restrictions as they&#x2019;d view the journey as more worthwhile, a Congressional advisor who is familiar with the trips and agreed to speak on condition of anonymity said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s frustrating we&#x2019;re not allowed to spend a little more time in Kyiv to get a taste and feel of what is going on in people&apos;s minds, never mind Kyiv, but other places as well,&#x201D; the advisor said. &#x201C;People&apos;s time is like a currency here, as well as attention.&#x201D; It is because of these restrictions &#x2014; which are common in wartime for members of the U.S. government &#x2014; that Rep. Panetta says he and many others have come to rely on privately sponsored trips. When groups like the Atlantic Council, the UN&#x2019;s Refugee Agency, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies sponsor trips, representatives are able to stay in Ukraine for multiple days and travel beyond Kyiv. These multi-day trips often feature visits to Kharkiv and Odesa and allow representatives to collect what Rep. Panetta says is the most effective knowledge and message to take back to non-supportive members of Congress. &#x201C;Actually getting in and getting on the ground and staying on the ground and having the conversations and having the experience that I believe is necessary to understand (Ukraine),&#x201D; Rep. Panetta said. The privately sponsored trips do however come with a requirement of six hours of meetings per day, which is not a requirement of official congressional travel. The benefit of the condensed official trips is that they typically come with the highest level of meetings since they run through the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. Citing security reasons, the State Department and U.S. Embassy in Kyiv declined a request to comment. The U.S. embassy in Kyiv &#x2014; which also operates under Washington-ordered restrictions &#x2014; hasn&#x2019;t returned to pre-full-scale invasion staffing, which Elizabeth Hoffman, CSIS director of congressional and governmental affairs, says contributes to the limited number of congressional trips that are time and resource-intensive for the embassy.

(Eduard Kryzhanivskyi/Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)As a security measure, for every U.S. government employee who enters Ukraine, a Ukraine-based colleague must temporarily relocate outside of the country for the duration of the staff member&#x2019;s visit, Hoffman said. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv declined to comment on whether this policy was still in effect. &#xA0; In early October, staffers from multiple congressional offices were in Ukraine on CSIS&#x2019;s fourth sponsored trip, the first of which they self-financed and the second with grants from the Howard G. Buffet Foundation. CSIS, which said they initiate the trips and approach members of Congress with the intention of not taking the same member twice, declined to disclose the cost of such trips. After accounting for logistics and security measures by an outside company, each trip is under $100,000, Hoffman said. Aside from the restricted official one-day delegations and the private trips that are likely to continue as a workaround, there is an additional option based on a decades-old law that is normally available to members of Congress that is off the table for diplomacy in Ukraine. The U.S. has an agreement with nearly 90 countries that allows foreign governments to sponsor the travel and hosting of U.S. representatives in the name of cultural exchange. Besides the State Department&#x2019;s sign-off, these agreements come with minimal restrictions and have long been used as an easy way for congressional staff and representatives to tour other countries. The decades-old law called the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 includes countries such as Yemen, Venezuela, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Ukraine has never had a MECEA agreement with the U.S., meaning the Ukrainian government can&#x2019;t sponsor cultural and educational trips for U.S. representatives. This leaves official and privately funded trips as the only option, both of which require immense documentation and pre-approval by House and Senate ethics committees, which is not required for MECEA trips. There is a sense in Washington among some foreign policy experts that the restrictions are on par with the current administration&apos;s widespread fears of escalation with Russia. The more U.S. personnel in Ukraine, the more Russia could see it as American involvement in Ukraine, the worry goes. Some even think the tightening of diplomacy in Ukraine is an overcorrection from 2012 when four Americans including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in Benghazi, Libya. Others see the limitations as commonplace wartime protocol and smart safety precautions. Regardless, advocates for Ukraine in Washington say there is no replacement for Americans being on the ground in Ukraine. &#x201C;The ability of members of Congress and staff to travel to Ukraine and to see the spirit of resilience among the Ukrainian people and to experience just a taste of what the Ukrainian people experience on a daily basis is the most convincing and most powerful advocacy tool that exists,&#x201D; Scott Cullinane, Razom for Ukraine&#x2019;s director of government affairs said. &#x201C;There&apos;s nothing comparable that helps people in Washington understand what&apos;s happening and to be convinced of the justness of Ukraine&apos;s cause.&#x201D; While being one of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest conduits for advocacy in Washington, Razom&#x2019;s 501(c)(3) status means they&#x2019;re unable to sponsor congressional trips to Ukraine. &#x201C;There&apos;s no replacement, no substitute for physically going and being present in Ukraine, even if it&apos;s only just for a few days,&#x201D; Cullinane said.	https://kyivindependent.com/time-is-currency-constrained-us-congressional-trips-to-ukraine-stymies-diplomatic-efforts/	2024-10-09T10:51:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1765274252.jpg
Russia reportedly redeploys Kinzhal missiles carrier to Belarus for first time in over a year	A Russian MiG-31K interceptor aircraft, capable of carrying hypersonic Kinzhal ballistic air-to-surface missiles, landed at the Machulishchy airfield in Belarus on Oct. 9, the Belaruski Hajun monitoring group reported. According to the group, the MiG-31K landing is the first in a year and a half. In April 2023, three Russian MiG-31Ks left the country and have not been spotted there since then. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, hasn&apos;t directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. Moscow stationed several MiG-31K aircraft in Belarus after the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022, launching missiles at Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities from its airfields. Russia frequently lifts MiG-31K aircraft from airfields on its territory to attack Ukraine. The advanced air-launched Kinzhal missile is difficult to intercept and shoot down. They have an operational range of some 2,000 kilometers, which means that all of Ukraine is at risk if the missile is launched from Russian airspace. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said in January that air defenses had intercepted 25 out of 63 Kinzhal missiles since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-redeploys-kinzhal-missile-carrier-to-belarus-for-first-time-in-1-5-years/	2024-10-09T10:19:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1222402983.jpg
Forced to flee war-torn Kherson, bar finds new life as popular Kyiv spot	In late summer of 2022, Lunca Bar owner Yehor Lohvynovskyi and his team were taking a walk in central Kyiv when they spotted an empty courtyard &#x2014; &#x201C;We should open a bar here!&#x201D; one of his coworkers said half-jokingly. None of them knew at the time that the joke would turn into real business plans less than a year later in February 2023. The bar&#x2019;s original location, the southern city of Kherson, while liberated from Kremlin forces in November 2022, was under constant Russian shelling. Rebuilding in Kyiv was the only path forward for the business if it wanted to stay open. Today, Lunca Bar stands in the heart of Kyiv, its vibrant courtyard filling up during the warm season. Inside, the team recreated the cozy atmosphere of the Kherson location, with some of the bar&#x2019;s original tables and the walls still adorned with artwork from the city&#x2019;s artists. The war has reshaped the landscape of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, forcing businesses to adapt or relocate. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 99% of the country&#x2019;s economy, have been hit particularly hard. These businesses provide 82% of Ukraine&#x2019;s jobs and account for 65% of total sales and production. Since the full-scale invasion, 7,820 businesses have relocated within Ukraine, according to Ukrainian analytics firm Opendatabot. A team of Lunca Bar in Kyiv in January 2022. (Personal archive of Lunca Bar Team)Founded in 2015 by Lohvynovskyi and his partner, Lunca Bar started as a 30-person speakeasy. Over the years, it grew into a central hub for the community. &#x201C;The philosophy was always more than just alcohol,&#x201D; Lohvynovskyi said. &#x201C;It was about the atmosphere and bringing people together.&#x201D; By 2022, Lunca had doubled in size and added a terrace. Then war came. When Russian forces invaded Kherson right after the start of the invasion, Lunca Bar became a shelter for the team and a lifeline for locals, providing clean water and bread as supplies grew scarce. On June 3, 2022, everything changed. Russian forces knocked on Lunca&#x2019;s door and demanded that the bar be turned over to them. Lohvynovskyi, who had already left for Kyiv in May, knew it was time to get the team out of Kherson. The team decided to use the company&#x2019;s reserve fund for the evacuation. The plan was to relocate everyone to Kyiv, secure temporary employment, and volunteer every Friday together at a charity based in the center of Kyiv.

(Personal archive of Lunca Bar Team)About settling in the city, about six months passed before the team finally decided they wanted to reopen in Kyiv. &#x201C;I gathered the team,&#x201D; Lohvynovskyi said. &#x201C;I told them, &#x2018;This is going to be an all-in effort. It will be tough &#x2014; we&#x2019;re strangers in the capital, and we&#x2019;ll have to do everything ourselves. Are you ready to give it 105%?&#x2019;&#x201D; The team didn&#x2019;t flinch. Their answer was simple: &#x201C;Easy.&#x201D; The team faced another new challenge. &#x201C;Aside from taking our city and bar, the war also took my phonebook,&#x201D; Lohvynovskyi said. &#x201C;All the connections we built over the years were gone &#x2014; everyone was scattered around the world.&#x201D; But luck came when a group of local Kyiv lawyers offered their services pro bono, helping them navigate the logistical hurdles and giving them the boost they needed to move forward. Once they found the right spot, the team set June 22, 2023, as the opening date. But Russia intervened again. On June 6, 2023, Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka Dam. Lohvynovskyi and his team rushed back to Kherson, hoping to salvage whatever they could from the original Lunca Bar before the water reached the right bank. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of the destruction caused to Lunca Bar in Kherson after Russia blew up the Kakhovka Dam in Kherson Oblast on June 6, 2023. (Personal archive of Lunca Bar Team)They were too late. When they arrived, Lunca Bar was already underwater. Seventy percent of their equipment and furniture was floating. Despite the devastation, the team launched a rescue mission, saving what they could &#x2014; including a dog stranded on a rooftop &#x2014; and offering help to nearby towns also hit by the flooding. For the opening, which was delayed by a month due to the Kakhovka dam&#x2019;s destruction, they used the furniture rescued from the flood, attaching QR codes that linked to videos of their recovery efforts. &#x201C;We invited Khersonians who had relocated to Kyiv,&#x201D; Lohvynovskyi said with a smile, &#x201C;because who better than them would understand the journey we had taken?&#x201D; When asked about the importance of small businesses staying in Ukraine, Lohvynovskyi reflects: &#x201C;I am an optimist. I believe in a better fate for our country, and I want to contribute to securing that future. I feel a huge responsibility &#x2014; for my hometown and for the capital, which has welcomed me as an entrepreneur.&#x201D; Lohvynovskyi admits that had Russia not invaded, he would have never imagined moving to Kyiv. &#x201C;I was happy in Kherson. We had the sea, the river, I had a house by the water, a job by the sea, a motorboat. Every Friday, I would go to the house by the river to spend time with my family. But I had no choice &#x2014; I made the conscious decision to move to Kyiv. Even though I wasn&#x2019;t fond of it at first, Kyiv was safer than most cities, and I knew I could give my team employment here, if not at Lunca Bar, then at other bars.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/an-all-in-effort-a-bar-from-war-torn-kherson-finds-new-life-in-ukraines-capital/	2024-10-09T10:03:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/upd_.jpg

‘We believe that in 5 years, Ukraine's defense sector will attract half a billion dollars;’ Q&A with foreign defense investors	Ukraine has become a hotbed of defense innovation, as Russia&#x2019;s deadly invasion fuels a rapid development of new battlefield technologies. Kyiv now aims to become a global leader in the defense sector, but with its economy drained by the war, it needs foreign investment to accomplish its goal. Ukraine has the capacity to produce around $20 billion worth of weapons and equipment, according to government estimates, but the state budget can only fund around $6 billion. The government has launched several initiatives to encourage foreign investment, including the Brave1 accelerator program, which was launched in April 2023 and brings together defense start-ups, investors, and government stakeholders to encourage innovation and investment. Investors Andre Pienaar, co-founder and chief executive of investment firm C5 Capital, and Rear Admiral Michael Hewitt, co-founder and chief executive of energy and security firm IP3, have been working as strategic partners of Brave1. The Kyiv Independent spoke with the two investors in Kyiv about the state of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense start-ups, what technologies most excite them today, and what can be done to encourage more investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe Ukraine&#x2019;s start-up defense sector right now, and what has changed as it matures? Michael Hewitt: Ukraine has gone from having a traditional defense industry to now shifting its attention to the innovation of asymmetric warfare, drone warfare &#x2014; air, sea, even subsea. What we&apos;re looking to do now is lift that to the next phase of venture capital: growth, scalability, and following exactly what President Zelensky said he wanted to do, which was build capacity in the defense industry. Everything from artillery shell factories to building up the capacity to defend the country and be part of the European defense industry. The second thing he wants is to protect and scale his own defense industrial base. We also need to protect and scale up the assets of key companies of Ukraine that have been part of the defense industry before. And then finally, the area that we&apos;re most focused on, is the pure innovative tech side.

(Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#xA0;The Kyiv Independent: Which recent innovations have excited you the most? Andre Pienaar: I think Ukraine is the leader today in the use of unmanned vehicles of all kinds, whether it&apos;s on land or sea or air, and also the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning for national defense. Those are two very exciting areas. And then another area that is not being talked about a great deal, but which is just as important, is cybersecurity. The cybersecurity market in Ukraine &#x2014; although it is still quite small, about $100 million &#x2014; we think it has terrific potential to grow. Ukraine has been a base of great technology professionals and technology know-how for a very long time. Many American, British, and European companies have been relying on Ukrainian technology professionals and Ukrainian engineers for their R&amp;D. That same world-class excellence in engineering and know-how is now being applied to cybersecurity. And so we see not only Ukrainian cybersecurity services companies growing, but also new cybersecurity products being created in Ukraine. This ability to work very closely with Ukrainian cybersecurity companies is very advantageous, not only for Ukraine, but also for the U.S because the things that Russia is trying to do to Ukraine with cybersecurity are at some point going to make their way in the form of ransomware or a cyber attack on America. The Kyiv Independent: A few weeks ago, BraveOne announced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech industry had attracted $12 million in private investments since the beginning of the war. This number has grown compared with last year but is still very low compared to other countries. What do you think is stopping investors? Andre Pienaar: This year, about $9 billion has been invested in U.S. defense tech startups and about $2 billion across all of Europe. So in that context, $12 million is a very modest amount of money. We are going to be working very hard to bring more VC investment firms from other allied countries to Ukraine to really build an allied VC community around Ukraine to scale this capital. I think there are two things that we can do in Ukraine to scale this capital. One is to do as much mentoring among founders as possible about lessons learned, mistakes made, and how to work with outside capital and venture capital. I think many Ukrainian founders are still learning about venture capital, how it works, and how to open up their businesses for outside investment. The second thing I think is really important is that the government does as much as it can to lift restrictions on the export of Ukrainian intellectual property and know-how so that Ukrainian founders can build companies that can really go global and become unicorns. If you look at the U.S. market, yes, the U.S. is a big country. It has access to a lot of capital. But the most successful American VC-backed companies have all become global companies. And they&apos;ve become global companies because they&apos;ve not been subject to export restrictions. And so easing those export restrictions in an intelligent and thoughtful way that will protect Ukrainian interests, protect Ukrainian know-how, but also allow Ukrainian companies to scale and grow their businesses globally and access other markets, I think it&apos;s really important. The Kyiv Independent: Ukraine&#x2019;s defense field has gotten quite crowded, with experts predicting consolidation in the future. What makes a start-up stand out to you among the hundreds vying for your attention? Michael Hewitt: It is a very crowded space, and to differentiate one UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) from another is sometimes very difficult to do. Our view on innovative tech in Ukraine is not just hardware, but it could be software, it could be training, it could be as simple as understanding there&apos;s a slight modification that can be made to improve the warfighting effectiveness of many of these companies. A lot of it, I think, is going beyond first-person-view drones or autonomous drones into operating in the electromagnetic spectrum. Because what the Russians are doing quite well is jamming our counter-drone technology. It&apos;s fascinating that you can take down a $100 million fighter jet with a homemade system. But the opposite is true as well. We&apos;re having to shoot million-dollar missiles at Russian drones. In that crowded field, we&apos;re going to be looking for technologies that are winning on the battlefield, that can be adjusted and developed for the war &#x2014; technology that can be in constant development and improving upon its capability. And then finally, one that we believe ultimately will be exportable for the international market. The one thing I will say that is amazing here in Ukraine, and something we want to help accelerate, is the connection between the warfighter and the technology. It&apos;s really unprecedented, and it&apos;s an outcome of fighting for survival. The Kyiv Independent: Any final thoughts on defense tech investment in Ukraine? Andre Pienaar: Our mission here is to scale the capital that gets invested into Ukrainian companies from $20 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. Nothing prevents Ukraine from attracting half a billion dollars of venture capital every year from the U.S., UK, Europe, and elsewhere. We are going to work very hard to educate other venture investors about the opportunity in Ukraine, how to invest successfully in Ukraine, how to travel to Ukraine, how to meet Ukrainian founders, and really match the potential of the defense sector with fresh and new capital. I want to say on the record that we believe that in the next five years, the Ukrainian defense sector will attract half a billion dollars of venture capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-believe-that-in-5-years-ukraines-defense-sector-will-attract-half-a-billion-dollars-q-a-with-foreign-defense-investors/	2024-10-09T07:44:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1980079331.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine's road to victory may lie in a 'Korean solution'	Victory in war is sometimes easy to define. World War II ended with Allied troops in control of Berlin and Tokyo, and with the German and Japanese leadership removed. The Vietnam War, on the other hand, ended in a clear defeat for the United States: North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam despite the futile expenditure of 58,000 American lives. The Korean War is sometimes called a stalemate because it never formally ended. But such definitions can be deceiving. In Iraq, the U.S. removed Saddam Hussein but neither found weapons of mass destruction (the justification for their deployment) nor turned that country into a functioning democracy. Worse, some cynics would argue that the true victor was Iran, which became the most influential political force in Iraq. On the other hand, though the demilitarized zone remains in place in Korea, the southern half of the peninsula has evolved into a vibrant, prosperous democracy with an annual per capita income of $35,000, whereas North Korea is a dangerous dictatorship with an estimated annual per capita income of $1,200 and recurrent food crises. Who won the stalemated war? This brings us to Ukraine, where the definition of victory depends on the participants&#x2019; war aims and time horizons. In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine on the pretext of protecting Russian speakers in Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region. Eight years later, Russia tried to complete the process by destroying Ukraine as an independent state. As Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote in 2021, he did not regard Ukraine as an independent nation but as part of the larger Russian world. He massed troops on the border with the intent of capturing Kyiv in a few days and replacing the Ukrainian government, much as the Soviet Union had done in Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968. He failed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected advice to flee the country and create a government in exile, and instead rallied his troops, saved the capital, and derailed Putin&#x2019;s plan. Zelensky subsequently used the soft power of attraction to win foreign support and increase Ukraine&#x2019;s hard power of military might. The result of Putin&#x2019;s invasion was to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s national identity and NATO, which has added two new members, Finland and Sweden, that previously had a long-standing policy of neutrality. Judging by Putin&#x2019;s original war objectives, Ukraine has already won. The problem, of course, is that Russian troops still control approximately one-fifth of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory, and Putin has revised his war goals to demand that Ukraine recognize his annexation of four eastern provinces (including some that Russian troops do not fully control). The war seems to be stalemated, but Putin has turned it into a war of attrition. While Russian casualties are enormous, he may be betting that time is on his side, given Russia&#x2019;s larger population and economy. Eventually, Ukraine&#x2019;s will to fight may erode, as will Western support.

(Anatolii Stepanov / AFP via Getty Images)According to one recent poll, 26% of Ukrainians are open to a diplomatic solution, but they are not willing to engage in sham negotiations with an unrepentant Putin. Some 86% of Ukrainians believe that Russia is likely to attack again even if a peace treaty is signed. Though both Russia and Ukraine have expressed a willingness to negotiate, they remain far apart. This past summer, Hungary&#x2019;s Kremlin-friendly prime minister, Viktor Orban, went to Moscow to try to mediate, but failed to change Putin&#x2019;s position. Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to claim that he could settle the war in a day; but it is hard to see how that could be accomplished by anything short of a Ukrainian surrender. Recently, Czech President Petr Pavel, a former NATO general who has been a strong backer of Ukraine, stated that &#x201C;to talk about a defeat of Ukraine or a defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between.&#x201D; Pavel warned that part of Ukrainian territory will remain under Russian occupation temporarily, and that &#x201C;temporarily&#x201D; could mean years. If Ukraine defines victory as the return of all land that Russia has occupied since 2014, victory is not in sight. But if it aims to maintain its independence as a democracy linked to Europe, while reserving its right to the ultimate return of its territory, victory remains possible. But this possible victory also means that Putin must not be able to declare his own victory. Ukraine must be given the support it needs to strengthen its bargaining position. Even if Ukraine cannot achieve its maximalist goals in the short run, the legitimacy of its position would be preserved in the long term as long as Russian gains are not recognized. This is sometimes referred to as a Korean solution. An armistice and demilitarized zone along the line of control would be monitored by international peacekeepers, so that Russia would draw in many other countries were it to resume its attack. While it may not be possible to get 32 NATO members to agree to Ukraine&#x2019;s formal membership in the alliance at this time, a group of NATO members calling themselves &#x201C;friends of Ukraine&#x201D; could monitor the zone and vow to respond to any new act of Russian aggression. Finally, Ukraine would also need assistance to rebuild its economy and access to EU markets. While a Korean solution would not satisfy Ukraine&#x2019;s maximalist goals in the short term, it would certainly deserve to be called a Ukrainian victory.

Ramstein-format meeting postponed after Biden cancels foreign visits	The next summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) scheduled for Oct. 12 in Germany was postponed after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his overseas travel to handle Hurricane Milton, AFP reported on Oct. 9, citing a statement by the Ramstein Air Base. Biden was supposed to convene a first leader-level meeting of the Ramstein summit in Germany weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, where President Volodymyr Zelensky was expected to present his victory plan. The U.S. president put off his visits to Germany and Angola in order to oversee the emergency response to Hurricane Milton, according to the White House&apos;s spokesperson. No new date for the summit was announced. &quot;Announcements about future Ukraine Defense Contact Group meetings will be forthcoming,&quot; the statement read. The Kyiv Independent reached out for comment to Ukraine&#x2019;s Presidential Office but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. During the last one, Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. Zelensky already presented his five-point plan to Biden during his trip to the U.S. in late September. Ukraine&apos;s president also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. Kyiv also may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the Ramstein summit, the Washington Post reported, citing an undisclosed diplomat.	https://kyivindependent.com/ramstein-format-meeting-postponed-after-biden-put-off-his-foreign-trips/	2024-10-09T07:11:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
Ukraine sells state-owned titanium producer in privatization auction to fund state coffers	Ukraine sold state-owned UMCC-Titanium for Hr 3.94 billion ($96 million) to Cemin Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s State Property Fund said on Oct. 9 in a statement. As Russia&#x2019;s war drags into its third year, a difficult business climate and decreasing tax incomes has strained Ukraine&#x2019;s state budget, with almost half of its planned expenses for 2024 covered by foreign aid and loans. Earlier this year, the country&#x2019;s finance minister warned of a gap in Ukraine&apos;s state budget of $5 billion for military expenditures. &#x201C;The budget will receive significant resources for strengthening our defense capabilities,&#x201D; Ivanna Smachylo, the head of the fund said in the statement. UMCC-Titanium is one of the world&#x2019;s largest producers of titanium, and miners of rutile and zirconium concentrate. The company was established by Ukraine&#x2019;s government in 2014 to manage and operate the Vilnohirsk and Irshansk mining and metallurgical plants, and has been managed by the state property fund since 2019. Cemin Ukraine, a Neqsol Holding company, was the sole bidder in the auction. The international Neqsol Holding group of companies is owned by Azeri businessman Nasib Hasanov. The company owns Vodafone, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest mobile operator. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer is required to preserve the company&#x2019;s main activities, invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.7 million), and repay arrears and overdue payables to the state budget, which amount to Hr 609 million ($14.8 million) as of the end of March, the fund&#x2019;s statement read. The Cabinet of Ministers still has to approve the sale. The privatization is part of the country&#x2019;s &quot;Great Privatization&quot; initiative, recently relaunched in September as a way to bring more revenue to the state. Privatizing large state-owned assets in the country has been slow to take since the country gained independence in 1991 largely due to corruption and mismanagement. &#x201C;Several more enterprises in this industry are planned for privatization in the future, in particular, Demurinsky GZK and &quot;VSMPO Titan Ukraine,&#x201D; the statement added. In a recent auction, the symbolic Hotel Ukraine located in central Kyiv was sold at an online auction in for Hr 2.5 billion ($61 million) to Ukrainian businessman Maksym Krippa.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sells-state-owned-titanium-producer-in-privatization-auction-to-fund-state-coffers/	2024-10-09T07:09:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-103398461-1.jpg
Lithuania blocks and fortifies bridge to Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave	Lithuania has blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman river linking it to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, the country&#x2019;s defense minister said on Oct. 9. In a post on Facebook, Laurynas Kasciunas said &#x201C;dragons teeth&#x201D; obstacles had been deployed on the structure, which has also been reinforced by iron beams. Kasciunas said other bridges leading to Kaliningrad would also be fortified, and some may even be mined. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine exacerbated fears of a potential open conflict between Moscow and NATO, and Lithuania, bordering Russia&apos;s ally Belarus and Kaliningrad, would be one of the first countries threatened by such a clash. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small but heavily armed territory lodged between the Baltic Sea and NATO members Poland, and Lithuania. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base located there. &quot;Kaliningrad is essentially a Russian weapons depot, and it has a lot of militarily operational equipment in use, not just in storage,&quot; Elisabeth Braw, a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year. The map of the Baltic Sea region. (The Kyiv Independent)Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia, the Estonian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 19. Vilnius has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war, leading to a sharp deterioration of relations with Moscow. The country has delivered 155-mm ammunition, armored personnel carriers, winter clothing, and anti-drone systems. Lithuanian customs officers discovered military uniforms and camouflage nets on passenger trains traveling from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to Moscow, sending them to Ukraine as military aid, it was reported on Oct. 6. Another incident on the Kaliningrad-Moscow railway occurred last week. One carriage of a train that arrived at the Kena checkpoint at the Lithuanian-Belarusian borders displayed the letter Z, a symbol commonly used by Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Another carriage displayed an inscription calling Vilnius, Lithuania&apos;s capital a &quot;Russian city.&quot; The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania along with other Baltic countries in World War II, with the nation declaring independence only in 1990.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-blocks-and-fortifies-bridge-to-russias-kaliningrad-exclave/	2024-10-09T07:05:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/462594311_10232824581746113_3712870896681842438_n.jpg
Two more IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems arrive in Ukraine	Ukraine received two IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems from Berlin last week, German Major General Christian Freuding said in an interview with the news outlet RND published Oct. 9. Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sept. 4, on top of the seven other systems that have already been delivered. Ukraine will receive two more by the end of the year, Freuding said. By 2026, Ukraine should receive 24 IRIS-T systems from Germany &#x2014; 12 of medium-range versions and 12 short-range &#x2014; it was reported last month. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-more-iris-t-anti-aircraft-systems-arrive-in-ukraine/	2024-10-09T06:26:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575143.jpg
Hungary’s Orban rebuked by EU chief over Russia stance, complains of ‘political propaganda’	European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen rebuked Hungary over its stance on Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, and its strengthening of political and economic ties with Moscow in comments at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Oct. 9 In what promised to be a heated plenary session, Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban had hoped to discuss his country&#x2019;s plans for the Presidency of the European Council which it currently holds until the end of the year. Instead, he was confronted by von der Leyen who rebuked several aspects of his country&#x2019;s stance towards Russia. &quot;The world has witnessed the atrocities of Russia&apos;s war. And yet, there are still some who blame this war not on the invader but the invaded. Not on Putin&#x2019;s lust for power but on Ukraine&#x2019;s thirst for freedom,&quot; von der Leyen said. Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Ukraine, pushed for negotiations, and frequently spouted Kremlin talking points. Hungary has condemned Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion while refusing to supply Ukraine with weapons. &quot;So I want to ask them, would they ever blame the Hungarians for the Soviet invasion in 1956?&quot; von der Leyen said while looking directly at Orban. The comment came after a top aide of Orban criticized Ukraine&apos;s resistance to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, calling it &quot;irresponsible&quot; and suggesting his country would have advised against fighting back if it had been asked. Balazs Orban &#x2013; no relation to the prime minister &#x2013; made the comments when discussing Hungary&apos;s anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 which was brutally put down by the Red Army. &quot;Considering 1956, we would have probably not done what President Zelensky did 2.5 years ago, as it is irresponsible, as we can see that he led his country into a defensive war, many lives were lost and territories lost,&quot; he said in an interview published Sept. 26. Orban rejected von der Leyen&#x2019;s parallel, saying &quot;there is nothing in common between 1956 and the Russian-Ukrainian war.&quot; Von der Layen also criticized Hungary&#x2019;s scheme to simplify the procedure to grant visas to Russian nationals, describing it as a &quot;backdoor for foreign interference.&quot; Orban dismissed the criticism as &quot;political propaganda.&quot; &quot;I would have been pleased to debate the presidential program but I see you&#x2019;re not interested,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-rebuked-by-eu-chief-over-russia-stance-complains-of-political-propaganda/	2024-10-09T05:57:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176886229.jpg
Ukrainska Pravda raises alarm over 'systematic pressure' from President's Office	Ukrainska Pravda (UP), one of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest news media sites, on Oct. 9 said &quot;ongoing and systematic pressure&quot; from the Ukrainian President&apos;s Office is threatening the work of the outlet, and is an attempt to &quot;influence our editorial policy.&quot; In a statement published on their site, UP said that officials are being ordered not to communicate with UP journalists, they were being denied access to official events, and businesses were coming under pressure to cease advertising on the outlet&apos;s website and not sponsor the events UP organizes. The statement also highlighted a heated interaction between UP journalist Roman Kravets, and President Volodymyr Zelensky during a recent press conference at which Zelensky questioned the editorial independence of UP. &quot;These and other non-public signals indicate attempts to influence our editorial policy,&quot; the statement said. &quot;It is especially outrageous to realize this (comes) during the time of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when our joint struggle for both survival and democratic values &#x200B;&#x200B;is extremely necessary.&quot; The statement said that from now on, any attempts from the President&apos;s Office to pressure UP would be made public. &quot;Every such attempt only strengthens our motivation to expose corruption and ineffective management in higher echelons of power,&quot; the statement reads. The Kyiv Independent contacted the President&apos;s Office for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. Ukraine&apos;s independent media has taken great strides since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but concerns have been raised since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#x200B;&#x200B;Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in June indicated the &quot;shrinking&quot; of press freedom in Ukraine, highlighting a &quot;worrying decline&quot; in support and respect for media autonomy and increased pressure from the state or other political actors inside Ukraine. The statement came one month after the annual press freedom index published by RSF showed Ukraine rising compared to last year. As the Kyiv Independent reported in July, media still face different forms of pressure from authorities, according to Ukrainian editors and press freedom watchdogs, months after attacks on investigative journalists provoked a public outcry and condemnation. &quot;We have often encountered pressure in our work. But the last time we faced such economic restrictions was during the presidency of (Leonid) Kuchma,&quot; Sevgil Musayeva, editor-in-chief of UP, &#xA0;told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 9, referring to Ukraine&apos;s president from 1994-2005. Since being founded in 2000, two UP journalists have been killed &#x2014; co-founder Georgiy Gongadze, and top editor Pavel Sheremet. Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv. &#x200B;&#x200B;Belarusian-born Sheremet was blown up in his car in central Kyiv on July 20, 2016. Musayeva stressed the importance of making public the pressure UP was facing, and called on international audiences to take note. &quot;Ukraine must remain a democracy, and freedom of speech is one of the most important values in a free society,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainska-pravda-raises-alarm-over-systematic-pressure-from-presidents-office/	2024-10-09T05:01:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266154.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Croatia for regional summit	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Croatia on Oct. 9 to meet with Croatian Prime Minister Andrey Plenkovich, and participate in the third &#x201C;Ukraine - South East Europe&quot; summit, he announced on social media. During the previous summit in early 2024, participants signed a joint declaration in support of Kyiv while denouncing Russian aggression. The summit will host leaders and foreign ministers of Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Slovenia, and Turkey. The talks will focus on achieving peace, Ukraine&#x2019;s path to NATO and the EU, as well as the reconstruction of Ukraine, Zelensky said.

NATO entering ‘3.0’ version, Finland’s president says	NATO is entering its &quot;3.0&quot; version, and is returning back to its original role as a deterrent against threats &quot;mainly from Russia,&quot; Finnish President Alexander Stubb said during a press conference on Oct. 8 in Brussels. Created in 1949 in the early stages of the Cold War, the military alliance was formed to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. &quot;I firmly believe that we are now witnessing the creation of NATO 3.0,&quot; Stubb said, adding: &quot;We are back to the original role of NATO as a deterrence and strong military alliance with a threat coming from the East, mainly from Russia.&quot; Finland joined NATO early 2023 after ditching its longstanding neutral stance following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. &quot;We have a very common understanding inside the alliance about our security challenges, and I think it is extremely important now that we work on both &#x2013; deterrence and defense.&quot; Earlier this month Mark Rutte took &#xA0;the helm as the new secretary general of NATO, stressing on his first day that the alliance has to ensure that Ukraine &quot;prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation.&quot; Rutte added that NATO members have to &quot;spend more&quot; in order to &quot;increase our collective defense,&quot; adding: &quot;NATO&#x2019;s partnerships&#x2026; have to go wider, and deeper, given all the insecurities in the world.&quot; Helsinki has sent 25 military packages to Ukraine as of September 2024 with the total amount of military aid Finland has provided Kyiv now standing at 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion), its Ministry of Defense said. Finland will also host a new tactical battlegroup and new headquarters to lead NATO land operations in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-entering-3-0-version-finlands-president-says/	2024-10-09T02:39:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Opinion: The West cannot use its values to make sense of Russia	During the last decade, Western governments, analysts, and media personalities have struggled to understand Russia&#x2019;s actions and renewed imperial aggression in Ukraine &#x2013; especially as the invasion has turned into a quagmire that the Kremlin appears unable to escape. Since 2022, one-third of Russia&#x2019;s prized Black Sea Fleet has been incapacitated, over 3,000 tanks lost, and casualties have reached levels not seen since World War II. Yet, there has been no major anti-war uprising in Russia like those seen during the Soviet-Afghan War, nor significant pushback against the ruling elite, save from a one-day mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group. The fundamental error is that we apply our own standards to analyze Moscow&#x2019;s actions. Because of this, the war continues, as the Russian government and society operate under different expectations. Vladimir Putin, now poised to have ruled Russia for three decades after his recent election victory, was initially seen as a reformer compared to former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Instead, he has exacerbated rhetoric on Russian imperial irredentism, particularly regarding Ukraine. Putin&#x2019;s hasty decision to ignite an all-out war on Ukraine in 2022, after consolidating control over Crimea and much of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region in 2014, puzzled many in the West. But trying to rationalize Putin&#x2019;s actions has played into his hands. A career KGB officer who served in East Germany, Putin witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, events he sees as tragedies that diminished Russian power. His career as a high-ranking intelligence officer taught him to call bluff and escalate at signs of weakness. From the West&#x2019;s limited response to chemical attacks in Syria to the lack of aid to Ukraine before 2022, Putin has escalated whenever he perceived weakness. Conversely, he has shown to de-escalate when confronted with strength, such as after Turkey downed a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft or the U.S. response during the Battle of Khasham. World leaders must understand that trying to make sense of a man who models himself after Joseph Stalin is futile. What Putin respects is strength, and for now, his bluffs must be called, or further escalation is likely. Against the backdrop of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia&#x2019;s force projection and military capabilities have taken a heavy toll on the nation. Currently, it would take Russia a decade to rebuild its military back to pre-2022 strength, and any other modern military would have withdrawn or frozen a conflict over such losses. However, Russia continues to press on. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia&#x2019;s defense industry has been plagued by embezzlement, fraud, and money laundering, which explains the heavy equipment losses. While the Su-57 and the T-14 Armata were promised to rival America&#x2019;s best equipment, neither the fifth-generation aircraft nor the premier Russian tank has made its way to Ukraine due to costs and major flaws the Kremlin refuses to address. Despite inheriting a massive Soviet stockpile, if Moscow continues the war, it risks depleting the majority of these resources. At the current pace, Russia&#x2019;s T-90, T-80, and T-72 tank fleet could be non-functional by 2026, with little remaining.

(Contributor/Getty Images)Russian generals and parliament members overseeing military progress have pocketed funds that Putin overlooked, and instead of making improvements, Russian service members suffer from a lack of equipment care, leading to heavy military casualties. &#x200B;&#x200B;The Russian invasion of Ukraine is not only the deadliest conflict since the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s but also the largest mass-casualty war for the Russian military since World War II. Estimates range from 500,000 to 700,000 casualties, with an uptick in killed and wounded during the late spring as Russia intensified its offensive actions in Kharkiv and Donetsk. Russia&#x2019;s mass casualties exemplify the country&#x2019;s lack of goals achieved in the war thus far, as Russia does not fully control any of the Ukrainian oblasts it wants to annex (Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson). The Kremlin has also failed in its attempts at regime change in Kyiv and landlocking Ukraine, but nevertheless, the war has not produced a major anti-war movement in Russia, nor a mass mutiny akin to the uprisings of 1917. One major reason for the absence of significant internal military or civilian uprisings is the system Putin has established and the historical context of irredentism in relation to military casualties. Putin has set up a strict hierarchy that places his intelligence apparatus, the FSB, above the military to clamp down on unmotivated generals. Historically, Russia is willing to accept mass casualties to achieve its goals. World Wars I and II saw Russia willing to endure millions of casualties to achieve objectives, and in Ukraine, this is no exception. Lacking Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), the Kremlin maintains a system where lower enlisted personnel will always obey orders &#x2013; regardless of how unlawful or inept they may be, such as the continuous human wave assaults that Russia employs in Ukraine. After the Wagner Group&#x2019;s brief mutiny and the decapitation of their leadership, there is now little resistance or pushback against Putin&#x2019;s brutal rule. The West should not expect any opposition or potential coup to emerge during the war. Instead, the West should continue providing substantial military aid to Ukraine and training Kyiv&apos;s new forces after the mobilization, as the best way to apply pressure on Russia&#x2019;s ruling elite is through the destruction of their pride &#x2013; the military. Ultimately, Russia has managed to escalate not only in Ukraine but also in Georgia and Syria by blackmailing the world with nuclear weapons. This policy was exacerbated after the decimation of the Wagner Group during the Battle of Khasham against U.S. forces. Nevertheless, Ukraine has demonstrated that Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;red lines&#x201D; concerning potential nuclear weapon use aren&#x2019;t worth the paper they&#x2019;re written on. Ukraine successfully liberated territory in Kherson that Russia claims as its own, forced the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw, and launched incursions into Kursk &#x2013; yet Russia did not respond with nuclear weapons. Western politicians and analysts need to remember that Putin and Russia will always respond to weakness and escalate at the sight of fear. The only way to maintain peace is to respond firmly and prepare for any scenario, including war.

Russian weapons depot storing North Korean shells, missiles set ablaze after drone attack, Ukraine's military reports	A Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. &quot;According to available information, missiles and artillery weapons, including those that came from North Korea, as well as guided aerial bombs, were stored on the territory of the warehouse,&quot; it said in a post on Telegram. &quot;A significant number were located under the open sky.&quot; The General Staff said the depot was the 67th Arsenal of Russia&#x2019;s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU), located near the city of Karachev. Earlier on Oct. 9, the Telegram channel Astra said a warehouse in the Bryansk Oblast had been attacked, and local residents had reported air raid sirens in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 9. &#xA0; Videos accompanying Astra&#x2019;s post showed multiple, quick-fire explosions coming from the area of a large fire. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 9 that 47 Ukrainian drones had been shot down overnight, including 24 in Bryansk Oblast. It did not report any damage or casualties. Overnight, Ukrainian forces successfully struck Russia&apos;s 67th GRAU Arsenal, a massive ammunition dump outside of Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. Per local sources, the key Russian facility is violently burning, with dozens of secondary explosions seen and heard. pic.twitter.com/17z39WI2YI The fire comes only weeks after Ukraine hit one of the largest ammunition arsenals in Russia, destroying two to three months&apos; worth of munitions, according to Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg. North Korea began supplying Russia with artillery shells, possibly as early as mid-2022, to help it sustain its offensive in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s military strategy requires large quantities of artillery shells fired to destroy the opponent&apos;s positions or prepare ground assaults. More extensive ammunition supplies were confirmed by U.S. and South Korean intelligence in October 2023 following a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The shipments of artillery shells were followed by ballistic missiles, both of which have been deployed against Ukraine. Ukraine has long suffered a disadvantage in terms of ammunition supplies compared to Russia. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN on Sept. 5 that Russian forces currently fire shells at a ratio of around 2:1 to 2.5:1 to Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-confirms-drone-strike-on-russian-weapons-depot-storing-north-korean-shells/	2024-10-09T01:50:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-11_34_33-1.png
Hungary’s Orban says Trump won’t wait until inauguration to ‘manage a peace’ in Ukraine	Donald Trump won&#x2019;t wait until being inaugurated in January to &quot;manage a peace&quot; in Ukraine if he wins next month&#x2019;s U.S. presidential election, Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a news conference in Strasbourg on Oct. 8. Speaking to reporters, Orban did not shy away from naming his preferred candidate in the elections. &quot;We will open several bottles of champagne if Trump is back,&quot; he said. Orban, a long-standing ally of Trump, is also widely regarded as a key ally of Russia in the EU. Orban has repeatedly blocked aid to Ukraine, pushed for negotiations, and frequently spouted Kremlin talking points. Hungary has also condemned the war but has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons. In July, he embarked on a &quot;peace tour&quot; and met with Russian President Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and Trump. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 24 hours. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, the former president reiterated earlier statements that his primary concern was ending the war but once again refrained from providing any concrete details, despite previously being asked by President Volodymyr Zelensky to do so. &quot;He will not wait until the inauguration ceremony &#x2026; in order to manage a peace,&quot; Orban said. &quot;(He) will act immediately, so we as European leaders don&#x2019;t have any time to waste, because there would not be two or three months, as we usually have, between the election and the inauguration of the new president. &quot;We have to react first intellectually, philosophically, then strategically, and then at the level of action as soon as possible.&quot; Orban, in power since 2010, said earlier this year that &quot;God has plans (for Trump)&quot; to advance peace, referring to Trump&#x2019;s survival of an assassination attempt in July. Orban arrived in Strasbourg on Tuesday, and is scheduled to address the European Parliament&#x2019;s plenary meeting on Oct. 9.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-say-trump-wont-wait-until-inauguration-to-manage-a-peace-in-ukraine/	2024-10-08T23:15:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1143574041.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 664,120 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 664,120 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 9. This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,944 tanks, 17,751 armored fighting vehicles, 26,240 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,222 artillery systems, 1,223 multiple launch rocket systems, 973 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,718 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-664-120-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-08T22:23:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162331619.jpg
Ukrainian court sentences hackers who carried out over 5,000 cyberattacks for Russia	A Ukrainian court has sentenced in absentia two members of the Russian security service-backed (FSB) hacker group &quot;Armageddon&quot; for having carried out more than 5,000 cyberattacks against Ukrainian institutions and critical infrastructure, Ukraine&apos;s State Security Service (SBU) said on Oct. 8. Russian hackers have regularly targeted various Ukrainian government institutions as well as businesses with crippling cyberattacks aimed at disrupting numerous industries and government services. The unnamed hackers previously worked as SBU employees in occupied Crimea before voluntarily joining the FSB following Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the SBU said. The hackers primarily targeted internal systems in various ministries, including the Foreign Ministry as well as the Economic Development Ministry, gaining access to sensitive document management systems as well as servers with data on classified government structures. No additional details were provided as to what kind of information was stolen in the data breaches. The hackers were charged under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code with charges related to treason as well as unlawfully breaching computer and operating systems. The hackers were sentenced to 15 years in prison, with the sentence commencing from the time that the hackers are in Ukrainian custody. It is unclear if the hacker continue to conduct cyberattacks against Ukraine. Ukrainian and Western intelligence agencies warned on Sept. 5 that the notorious GRU Unit 29155 of Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) continues to carry out cyber attacks against critical infrastructure in NATO and EU countries. The U.S. charged five Russian intelligence officers and one Russian civilian on Sept. 5, who are suspected to have attempted attacks against Ukraine and at least 26 NATO countries, including the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-court-sentences-hackers-who-carried-out-more-than-5-000-cyberattacks-for-russia/	2024-10-08T21:42:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1238523443.jpg
Ukraine may face 'toughest' winter since invasion began, Rutte says	NATO&apos;s new Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on Oct. 8 that Ukraine may be facing its most challenging winter since the start of the full-scale invasion, as the country prepares for more Russian attacks against energy infrastructure. &quot;Russia continues to carry out massive strikes against Ukraine&apos;s critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine could be facing its toughest winter since the full-scale invasion began,&quot; Rutte said during a press conference alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Addressing the challenges that Ukraine faces in its third winter since the start of the war, Rutte said that &quot;NATO must and will do more to help Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The more military support we give, the faster this war will end,&quot; Rutte added, without directly specifying what additional support may look like. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on September 19 that the EU aims to cover around 4.5 gigawatts of energy capacity this winter, or roughly 25% of Ukraine&apos;s winter needs, as Ukraine&apos;s shortfalls continue. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. Energy deficits necessitated rolling blackouts during the summer and autumn, with some officials warning that Ukrainians may have electricity for 6-7 hours per day in the upcoming winter. Rutte, who began his term as Secretary General on Oct. 1, made his first surprise visit to Kyiv as the alliance&apos;s chief on Oct. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-face-toughest-winter-since-invasion-began-rutte-says/	2024-10-08T20:11:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/DSC07012.jpg
VP Harris urged Zelensky to develop succession plan in case of death or capture ahead of invasion, book excerpt reveals	Ahead of the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to develop a succession plan in case he were to be killed or captured, excerpts from the book &quot;War&quot; by journalist Bob Woodward revealed on Oct. 8. Zelensky has been the prime target for Russian assassination attempts since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late November 2023, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts. According to Woodward, Harris told Zelensky that he president needed to &#x201C;start thinking about things like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you are captured or killed or cannot govern,&#x201D; CNN reported. The conversation occurred alongside the coinciding of the Munich Security Conference where Harris revealed to Zelensky that a Russian invasion was imminent - a warning that Zelensky continued to dismiss until the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022. According to Woodward, Harris feared it would be the last time United States officials would see Zelensky alive. Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, has played an extensive role in the Biden administration&apos;s foreign affairs efforts, having held six separate meetings with Zelensky following the start of the invasion. At Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit in Switzerland in June, Harris represented the U.S. and announced over $1.5 billion in additional support for Ukraine. Harris also accused Russia of crimes against humanity for its war in Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference, saying the aggressor must be held responsible for their &quot;barbaric&quot; war operations. Under Ukraine&apos;s Constitution, the speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, would assume the presidency if Zelensky were unable to fulfill his duties.	https://kyivindependent.com/vp-harris-urged-zelensky-to-choose-successor-in-case-of-death-or-capture-ahead-of-invasion-book-excerpt-reveals/	2024-10-08T19:04:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-2157046218-612x612.jpg
Russia's strike on Sumy Oblast kills 2	Russia attacked the Esman community in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast on Oct. 8 with guided bombs, killing two civilians, local military administration reports. Russian forces struck a total of eight communities in Sumy Oblast in 22 separate attacks throughout the day. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with grenade launchers, drones, and guided bombs. The communities of Mykolaiv, Khotin, Yunakivka, Myropillia, Richkivka, Bilopillia, Krasnopillia, and Nova Sloboda were targeted. Russia has intensified strikes against the region since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in early August. Sumy Oblast and the Kursk region share a 245-kilometer (152-mile) border. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s Kursk Oblast incursion has helped prevent the occupation of Sumy Oblast and its regional center, the city of Sumy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-strike-on-sumy-oblast-kills-2/	2024-10-08T16:27:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/photo_2024-05-10-12_12_05-1.jpeg
US military identifies American weapons systems to support Ukraine in war with Russia, CNN reports	The U.S. military&#x2019;s top commander in Europe, Gen. Chris Cavoli, has drawn up a list of American weapons systems that could strengthen Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia but which the Biden administration has yet to supply. According to sources familiar with the classified report submitted to Congress last month, Cavoli&#x2019;s recommendations include the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the Link 16 communication system, a secure network used by NATO to enhance air and missile defense coordination, according to CNN. Despite repeated requests from Ukraine for these systems, the U.S. has withheld them, likely due to concerns about advanced U.S. technology falling into Russian hands, particularly with the Link 16 system. Additionally, U.S. officials have questioned the utility of air-launched missiles like JASSM without Ukraine first establishing air superiority. Ukraine continues to push for more advanced weaponry from the U.S., alongside efforts to lift restrictions on the use of American long-range missile systems. During his recent meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House, President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a detailed list of high-priority targets within Russia he wants to strike using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, sources said. Although Biden has blocked the use of U.S. long-range systems for strikes deep into Russia, he did not dismiss Zelensky&#x2019;s latest request outright but remained non-committal. The two leaders agreed to continue discussions, though officials suggest the U.S. will unlikely shift its stance on long-range missiles anytime soon. Amid these deliberations, the future of U.S. support for Ukraine remains in question, especially with the presidential election looming and uncertainties about long-term military aid beyond 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-identifies-american-weapons-systems-to-support-ukraine-in-war-with-russia-cnn-reports/	2024-10-08T15:59:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1430567940.jpg
Russia continues influence campaigns to support Trump's 2024 candidacy, US intelligence says	American voters are likely to face a surge of misinformation and influence campaigns orchestrated by U.S. adversaries, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials. These campaigns aim to sway the outcome of the upcoming presidential election and undermine trust in the process. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a new assessment on Oct. 7, just 29 days ahead of the Nov. 5 election, when voters will decide the next U.S. president and participate in numerous state and local races. &quot;We&apos;ve continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get closer to Election Day,&quot; said a senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking anonymously during a press briefing, according to the Voice of America (VOA). &quot;They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,&quot; the official added, emphasizing that the election might only mark the beginning of these efforts. U.S. intelligence officials report that Russia continues to actively run influence campaigns aimed at boosting former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump while undermining the campaign of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. In contrast, Iran is focusing its efforts on aiding Harris by damaging Trump&#x2019;s campaign. Officials highlighted an ongoing hack-and-leak operation targeting Trump&apos;s campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for Iran&#x2019;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has so far stayed out of the U.S. presidential race, instead concentrating on influencing American voters to oppose state and local candidates who are seen as unfavorable to Beijing&apos;s interests, particularly those who express support for Taiwan.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-continues-influence-campaigns-to-support-trumps-2024-candidacy-us-intelligence-says/	2024-10-08T14:03:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170583811.jpg
Russia has stolen over 180,000 tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied Mariupol, Shmyhal says	Russia has stolen more than 180,000 tons of Ukrainian grain through the port of the occupied city of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast alone, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a government meeting on Oct. 8. Already by mid-2023, Russia is believed to have stolen up to 6 million metric tons of grain harvested in occupied Ukrainian territories. The damage to Ukraine&apos;s agriculture industry is further compounded by the ongoing hostilities &#x2013; often targeting agricultural facilities &#x2013; and Russia&apos;s threats to the Black Sea shipping routes. According to Shmyhal, Russia continues to use food &quot;as an element of aggression.&quot; Kyiv has lost large swathes of farmlands in Ukraine&apos;s south and east to Russian occupation and damge from war. Despite this, Ukraine&apos;s exports from January to September amounted to almost 100 million tons. &quot;In other words, we exported as much in nine months as we did during the entire last year,&quot; Shmyhal said. Evidence compiled by human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance last year showed that Moscow prepared to steal grain supplies, target food infrastructure, and starve the Ukrainian population months before the full-scale invasion. Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has also threatened food security worldwide. Ukraine was the world&apos;s largest wheat producer before the invasion. As Russia canceled the Black Sea grain deal in July 2023, Kyiv opened a new corridor the following month. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-stolen-over-180-000-tons-of-ukrainian-grain-from-occupied-mariupol-shmyhal-says/	2024-10-08T12:04:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1237805988.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'Fights taking place at every building entrance' as Russia enters eastern Toretsk, military says	Key developments on Oct. 8: The situation in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast remains very difficult as Ukraine is fighting Russian forces in the eastern outskirts of the front-line town, a spokesperson of the Luhansk Operational Tactical Group said on Oct. 7. &quot;The fighting is taking place within Toretsk itself. The situation is unstable; fights are taking place literally at every building entrance,&quot; spokesperson Anastasia Bobovnikova said on air on national television. Moscow has focused its efforts against Toretsk over the past month as part of its grinding offensive in Donbas. The situation grows increasingly difficult in Ukraine&apos;s east as Russia captured the town of Vuhledar and closes in on Pokrovsk. Bobovnikova said it is difficult to assess which parts of the town are under Russian control but confirmed that Moscow&apos;s troops had entered the eastern outskirts, advancing along Tsentralna (Central) Street in the direction of the Tsentralna Mine. &quot;But the situation is constantly changing. Sometimes, we destroy their fire positions; sometimes, they destroy ours. But we are constantly regrouping and trying to regain what Russia captures,&quot; the spokesperson added. Russian forces launched 11 attacks against Toretsk and nearby settlements on Oct. 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Twelve more ground assaults were launched overnight on Oct. 8. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState indicates that settlements on the eastern outskirts of Toretsk &#x2013; Pivnichne, Zalizne, Druzhba, and Pivdenne &#x2013; are fully or almost completely in Russian hands. According to the monitoring group, Russian forces have been advancing along Tsentralna Street since late September and have reached the town&apos;s center as of Oct. 7. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine should receive the first Mirage 2000 fighter jets from France in the first quarter of 2025, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Oct. 8. French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled in June that Paris would provide Kyiv with an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5 planes to boost its airpower. The planes &quot;will be equipped with new equipment: air-to-ground combat capabilities and anti-electronic warfare defense,&quot; Lecornu said. &quot;The training of Ukrainian pilots and mechanics continues.&quot; The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. The French media previously reported that the version delivered to Ukraine would be equipped to hit ground targets. Russian troops committed to the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast outnumbered defending Ukrainian forces by around 9:1, Oleksandr Okhrimenko, commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, said in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Glavkom published on Oct. 8. Kyiv announced the withdrawal from Vuhledar on Oct. 2, after Russian forces first swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and then entered its urban area. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade had defended Vuhledar, one of the key strongholds of Ukraine&apos;s defense of southern Donetsk Oblast, for over two years without rotations. According to Okhrimenko, Moscow deployed Russia&apos;s 36th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, 39th Brigade, 57th Brigade, 91st Separate Rifle Regiment and other units to the final assault Vuhledar. &quot;The enemy&apos;s forces had superiority in tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, anti-tank weapons, and personnel,&quot; the commander said. The attacking side can gain an advantage on the battlefield if it has three times as many forces and means as the other one, Okhrimenko said, referring to a ballpark ratio commonly upheld in military doctrine around the world. &quot;It was 1:9 in Vuhledar. You can objectively understand the chances to hold this settlement and the line of defense in the brigade&apos;s sector of responsibility,&quot; he added. North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to help Russia, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers on Oct. 8, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. &quot;As Russia and North Korea have signed a mutual treaty akin to a military alliance, the possibility of such a deployment is highly likely,&quot; the minister said in the parliament. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. Asked about a recent report by Ukrainian media that North Korean service members were killed and injured near occupied Donetsk, Kim said that this is also likely true. The group of North Korean soldiers arrived in the Russian-held part of Ukraine to exchange experience with their Russian counterparts, Interfax-Ukraine reported on Oct. 4, citing a military intelligence source. Six were reportedly killed and three injured in a missile attack. &quot;We believe there have been injuries and fatalities among North Korean troops in Ukraine,&quot; Kim said, according to Politico. Russian forces carried out two attacks on the city of Kharkiv on Oct. 8, killing two people and injuring more than 30 others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A Russian morning attack against the industrial part of the eastern city of Kharkiv injured at least 21 people. One of the victims is 16 years old. Seventeen people have been hospitalized, while the others received medical assistance on the spot, local authorities reported. The governor initially said that Russia used air-dropped glide bombs but later clarified that the type of weapon used is still being determined. The city&apos;s infrastructure was damaged as a result of the attack, Syniehubov said without revealing additional details. Several hits were recorded in the city, resulting in a large-scale fire, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Later in the evening, Russia attacked Kharkiv with more glide bombs, killing at least two people and injuring five others. Terekhov said that according to preliminary data Russia hit a multi-story building in the second attack. The strike damaged 15 apartment buildings in the Saltivka district, he added. A woman and a man, both aged 70, are among the killed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-33/	2024-10-08T11:27:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163969407.jpg
We can't solve war in Ukraine without solving Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya says in exclusive interview	Editor&apos;s note: The interview has been edited for clarity. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Despite receiving popular support during the 2020 elections, the Belarusian opposition leader was kicked out of her country, her supporters were jailed en masse, while the country she wanted to lead is now entangled in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine on Moscow&apos;s side. What&#x2019;s more, Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s husband, Siarhei, arrested months before the elections in which he wanted to challenge Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, remains behind bars to this day. And despite Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s vast effort to lead her country&#x2019;s opposition and gain the support of the international community, her team has little to no sway over her country&#x2019;s policy, where dictator Lukashenko continues to call the shots. Ukrainian top officials have also largely ignored Tsikhanouskaya, balancing their act between the opposition and the current regime. Yet, Tsikhanouskaya doesn&#x2019;t give up. Tsikhanouskaya says the fates of Belarus and Ukraine are interlinked as both countries suffer under the Russian heel. &#x201C;We can support the Ukrainian army, and our Belarusian volunteers are fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukrainians,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The fate of Belarus and Ukraine are interconnected, and we can&apos;t solve one issue without another,&#x201D; she added. The Kyiv Independent met the Belarusian opposition leader during the Warsaw Security Forum on Oct. 2 to discuss her country&apos;s path to democracy, why free Belarus must be part of the resolution of the war in Ukraine, and discussed how to bring attention to the crimes of Lukashenko&apos;s regime. The Kyiv Independent: Earlier this year, Belarus moved significant forces to the Ukrainian border. More recently, Alexander Lukashenko said that an attack on Belarus would mean World War III. Do you see this as empty saber-rattling, or are there more tangible threats behind it? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: I&apos;m absolutely sure that Belarusian soldiers would never join the Russian army and would never attack Ukraine. And Lukashenko knows this. What he&apos;s doing is conducting drills or concentrating troops that are very loyal to him to sell some messages. He and the Belarusian people know that nobody&apos;s going to invade us or provoke us. But he&apos;s using this rhetoric to blackmail, to divert attention. When the Ukrainian army succeeded in the Kursk direction, Lukashenko was blamed by Russia because he dragged troops away from the border. And he immediately, to show loyalty to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin again, started these drills. So it&apos;s a provocation, nothing else. Of course, we have to watch closely what Lukashenko is doing because when it&apos;s necessary for Putin, he&apos;ll provide our (Belarusian) territories and facilities again (to Russia). But I don&apos;t believe that Belarusian soldiers would fight Ukrainians. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya speaks during the Warsaw Security Forum 2024 in Warsaw, Poland on Oct. 2, 2024. (Anton Filanovich / The Kyiv Independent)The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your position on Lithuania&apos;s request to the International Criminal Court to investigate Lukashenko, and what goals do you think this can achieve? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: For three years in a row already, we have been collecting evidence of Lukashenko&apos;s crimes. This feeling of impunity emboldens dictators. They think that they can unleash repression, torture people, and make people leave the country through intimidation. This referral is extremely important, first of all, as a message that all the perpetrators will be brought to accountability. But also &#x2013; maybe not immediately, but in the future &#x2013; &#xA0;it will have practical results. If an arrest warrant is issued against Lukashenko, he will become an intentional criminal. He will become a pariah. He&apos;s already a pariah to the democratic world, but legal justice should prevail. The Kyiv Independent: Over the past three months, the Belarusian regime has pardoned over 100 people who were imprisoned for taking part in the protests. Of course, many more remain jailed. What do you think was the motivation behind this wave of pardons? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: During the same period, more than 100 people were detained. So, we can&apos;t consider this release a change in Lukashenko&apos;s policy. He continues to repress people. I think it was a gesture for the Belarusian people and the world to improve his image. He again wants to play with these narratives, to say, &quot;Look, it&apos;s an act of humanity.&quot; I wouldn&apos;t suspect Lukashenko of humanity. He again wants to play this game before the so-called elections. I hope and actually believe that the democratic world will not change its policy regarding Lukashenko&apos;s regime because he has done it many times before. And this time, we have to do our job until our victory. The Kyiv Independent: There have been many discussions here at the Warsaw Security Forum about how to help Ukraine achieve victory and how to achieve just and lasting peace. Can the Belarusian opposition play a role in these efforts? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: I think that Belarus is part of the problem, but it might also be part of the solution. We are trying to get Belarus out of this war by dismantling Lukashenko&apos;s regime because independent and free democratic Belarus might help Ukrainians win this war. Of course, it also might be vice versa, that Ukrainian victory can help Belarus use this window of opportunity and dismantle the regime. &quot;I think that Belarus is part of the problem, but it might also be part of the solution.&quot; Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya speaks during the Warsaw Security Forum 2024 in Warsaw, Poland on Oct. 2, 2024. (Aleksander Kalka/NurPhoto via Getty Images) We can&apos;t give Ukrainians any assistance. We can&apos;t give military equipment or millions of dollars. But we can advocate for Ukraine at the international arena and explain why it&apos;s absolutely vital and necessary to give Ukrainians everything they need to win this war. We can support the Ukrainian army, and our Belarusian volunteers are fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukrainians. And also explain how the fate of Belarus and Ukraine are interconnected and that we can&apos;t solve one issue without another because Russia doesn&apos;t see Belarus or Ukraine as independent states. They see us as their colonies. The Kyiv Independent: Facing growing repressions, facing the presence of Russian troops and even nuclear weapons in Belarus, what do you see as the most realistic path towards democracy, towards independence from Russia? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: During the 30 years of Lukashenko&apos;s rule, he made our country, to a huge extent, dependent on Russia. And he&apos;s dragging our country into more and more dependence. We see how Russia interferes in our economy, our education, in our media. It&apos;s like a creeping occupation of our country. In the future, we will have to cut this dependence, and we&apos;re already working on reforms and diversification of the oil and gas supply. But now we have to weaken Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime as much as possible and strengthen the Belarusian people. This is our strategy at the moment. And also, during negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the Belarus issue should also be included. We have to demand a withdrawal of Russian troops, not only from Ukraine but also from Belarus. And the point about democratization should be in this (potential) document. Because if not, Lukashenko will sell our country piece by piece to Russia, and we&apos;ll lose our independence. The Kyiv Independent: Are you worried that if Belarus achieves independence, achieves democracy, Russia may simply invade and try to force Belarus to fall in line like it attempted to do when it invaded Ukraine in 2022? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: The democratic world has to say clearly that you can&apos;t influence domestic policies of different countries. If we think about this in such a way, we have to be always worried that Russia would invade any country. It&apos;s a wrong perception. We have to stop thinking that Russia is almighty and that everything in our region depends on Putin. Lukashenko always said, &#x201C;I&apos;m providing peace in Belarus, vote for me,&#x201D; but this is a person who already brought war to my country, who made Belarus a co-aggressor, who made Belarus a pariah in the world. Russia is already conducting an occupation but under Lukashenko&apos;s leadership.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-fate-of-belarus-and-ukraine-are-interconnected-tsikhanouskaya-says/	2024-10-08T11:21:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175735360.jpg
Anne Applebaum: Russia is ‘one of the world’s most unstable autocracies’	Democratic nations have grappled with a range of pressing issues in recent years, including the inherent flaws of long-established political systems, the erosion of international alliances, and global economic challenges, all while autocracies have been gaining power by exploiting this instability. American journalist and historian Anne Applebaum&#x2019;s latest book, &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.,&#x201D; delves into the complex mechanisms that underpin autocratic regimes, highlighting the roles of financial networks, surveillance technologies, and propagandists who bolster their narratives of power and control. Unlike the ideologically motivated autocrats of the Cold War era, today&apos;s authoritarian leaders, Applebaum argues, are driven solely by the pursuit of power. Unfazed by Western sanctions, countries like Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela form alliances to mutually support each other&apos;s financial, security, and political objectives. Russia, North Korea, and Iran are even being called by some the new &#x201C;Axis of Evil.&#x201D; In this context, maintaining an optimistic outlook can seem daunting. However, Applebaum underscores not only the urgent necessity of defending democracies against the rise of authoritarianism but also offers effective strategies for doing so. The Kyiv Independent recently spoke with Applebaum about the rise of autocracies and potential strategies the West can employ to counteract them. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: In &quot;Autocracy, Inc.,&quot; you detail how Russia has been a leader in merging autocracy with kleptocracy, creating a network of states that support and economically sustain one another in the face of international sanctions. Given the scale of this system Russia has helped put in place, do you think we are facing the long-term threat of an autocratic Russia even after Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s eventual demise? Anne Applebaum: I&#x2019;d hesitate to make any predictions about Russia&#x2019;s long-term future. Not only do we not know who might succeed Putin, but we also don&apos;t know how that successor would be chosen. In a sense, Russia stands out as one of the world&#x2019;s most unstable autocracies. In China, the Communist Party will select the next leader, and in Iran, a religious council stands behind the government. We know how these systems work. But in Russia, it doesn&apos;t really function as a system anymore &#x2013; Russia is essentially a one-man state. It&#x2019;s true that the autocratic system Russia has created has had a significant global impact, with many countries having imitated it. What used to be ordinary corruption has become financialized, allowing massive sums of money to be hidden. Autocrats can now turn political power into enormous wealth, becoming billionaires. This pattern, set by Russia, has been highly influential. It will likely persist beyond Putin, and it will continue until there&#x2019;s a way to challenge or counteract it. But as for what will happen to Russia after Putin&#x2019;s gone, that remains uncertain. The Kyiv Independent: One point in the book that really struck me is when you wrote that no country has autocracy in its &#x201C;genetic code.&#x201D; I think that it&#x2019;s important to remember this because looking at a country as irredeemably undemocratic, one might argue, could inadvertently bolster an autocrat&apos;s power. However, given the multitude of conflicts in recent years, how should democracies engage with autocracies like Russia and China in the future? Anne Applebaum: We need to think much more strategically about how we trade with these countries. Autocracies aim to leverage our technology and economic ties to exert influence within our countries. The idea that the economy is a neutral space without significant implications is one we need to abandon. It&apos;s crucial to understand this, but I&#x2019;m not advocating for cutting off all relations with these autocracies &#x2013; that&apos;s neither realistic nor practical. There are important discussions to have with autocratic governments, whether related to trade, climate change, or urgent crises. We can&apos;t ignore their existence. However, understanding their worldview is key in protecting our democracries. The goal of my book is to explain that they see themselves in a constant conflict with us, and we need to recognize this and respond accordingly. The Kyiv Independent: We&#x2019;ve seen growing frustration concerning international institutions like the U.N., which continue to engage with Russia as usual, even as it commits war crimes. In that sense, has the international rules-based order thought up after World War II already failed us, and if so, does it need to be radically rethought? Anne Applebaum: It failed some time ago, actually. The so-called international order has always been more aspirational than real. The U.N. Convention on Genocide didn&apos;t prevent the genocide in Rwanda, for example. Similarly, there are international laws against torture, but that hasn&#x2019;t stopped torture from being used in dozens of countries since 1945. These laws exist as ideals to strive for rather than guarantees. That said, some nations do take these standards seriously. When U.S. soldiers were accused of torturing Iraqi prisoners, they were court-martialed and went to prison. So, while some countries enforce these laws, many others do not. In my view, the U.N. system is beyond saving or rebuilding. It&apos;s a very 20th-century institution rooted in the belief that large bureaucracies based in places like New York or Geneva can solve global problems. This mindset reflects the world of the 1950s, but it&apos;s outdated. Instead, I would much prefer to see coalitions of countries wanting to solve specific issues. Take kleptocracy, for example. A group of 100 nations could come together to tackle offshore tax havens, anonymous companies, and money laundering. If these countries committed to the cause, they could create a meaningful plan to combat these problems. That&#x2019;s the kind of coalition worth building and focusing on moving forward. I don&apos;t believe a massive organization that includes Russia, China, Togo, Sierra Leone, and the U.S. is capable of solving international issues effectively. The Kyiv Independent: Considering the extent to which individuals within these very financial systems benefit, along with the complexities of a globalized economy, how feasible do you think these reforms are in our lifetime? Anne Applebaum: We&#x2019;re already seeing some changes in both the U.S. and the U.K. Significant progress has been made toward eliminating anonymous companies. In the U.K., both the prime minister and the foreign minister have given speeches addressing this issue, showing a clear desire to tackle it. David Lammy, in particular, has spoken about British overseas territories. His family hails from the West Indies. There&#x2019;s a growing political will to push back against these practices, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an impossible task. Of course, much depends on the outcome of the next U.S. election. Kamala Harris, for example, has a background as a prosecutor and a strong interest in the rule of law, so she might champion this issue. The Biden administration has already made some progress. American journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anne Applebaum is seen in Gdansk, Poland on Feb. 28, 2018. (Michal Fludra/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Obviously, if Donald Trump wins, things could go in the opposite direction. He has personally benefited from the offshore kleptocratic world &#x2014; this was part of his business model. A significant portion, perhaps a fifth, of the apartments in Trump-named buildings were bought by anonymous companies. We don&apos;t know who the real owners are, but many likely come from Russia, China, or other autocratic nations, possibly using these purchases for money laundering. Secrecy is a hallmark of autocracies. We don&apos;t know the sources of wealth for leaders like Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin, and this opacity is deliberate. That said, I believe it&apos;s possible to eliminate these practices. It will require a coalition of willing nations and a gathering of political will, but signs of that momentum are already visible. The Kyiv Independent: Many individuals, frankly speaking, seem uninterested in the developments occurring in countries like Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran, and the threats they represent, leading to a lack of urgency among the populaces of democracies. Unfortunately, democratic leaders have not effectively communicated these threats, which enables bad actors to mock and exaggerate concerns, such as the potential for Russian interference in U.S. elections. How can we better communicate to people that these threats are more interconnected than one might realize? Anne Applebaum: First, they would need to truly understand the issue, and I&#x2019;m not sure all of them do. They&#x2019;d also have to make it a priority. Foreign policy issues rarely take center stage in domestic election campaigns, so it&#x2019;s important to find a way to make them relevant. That&#x2019;s why, in my book, I focused on how autocratic practices are impacting us directly and influencing our internal politics. I believe that framing it this way is key to convincing people of its importance. I also recently co-produced a podcast with Peter Pomerantsev, who writes extensively about Ukraine. The podcast, &#x201C;Autocracy in America,&#x201D; explores how autocratic practices are present in the U.S. itself, aiming to engage American voters on this issue. It&#x2019;s all about finding new ways to connect with people and raise awareness. The Kyiv Independent: In &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.,&#x201D; you describe how authoritarian regimes frequently co-opt the language of independent media to present themselves as legitimate sources of information. Still, they spread disinformation that, in the internet age, quickly goes viral. Looking ahead, what strategies can democratic nations adopt to fortify their information ecosystems against such tactics? Is there anything that makes a democratic society more susceptible to propaganda and disinformation? Anne Applebaum: This is a complex issue, and at its core, it involves regulating social media. I don&apos;t see a solution without doing that. People like Maria Ressa have tried creating online networks to counter propaganda, but even she seems to have concluded that regulation is the only real answer. By regulation, I don&#x2019;t mean censorship &#x2013; I mean holding social media platforms legally responsible for the content on their sites. In the U.S., Section 230 currently protects platforms from being held liable for what users post, unlike newspapers or TV companies, which are responsible for what they publish. I believe we will eventually need to change that law, and I hope we&#x2019;ll see progress on this under a future administration, perhaps under Harris. To illustrate, if a bank were found to be funding terrorism or enabling the sale of child pornography, we wouldn&apos;t hesitate to hold the CEO accountable &#x2014; those actions are clearly illegal. Yet, somehow, internet platforms continue to avoid such accountability. It&apos;s time to change that. The Kyiv Independent: You dedicate &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.&#x201D; to the optimists. In a world where authoritarianism is on the rise, what does it mean to be an optimist, and how can such optimism be sustained in the face of these growing threats? Anne Applebaum: It&apos;s important to remember that history is not predetermined. There&#x2019;s nothing that guarantees democracy will fail, autocracy will succeed, or vice versa. We aren&#x2019;t promised victory in the end &#x2013; that&apos;s not how it works. The optimistic view is that what we do today directly shapes what happens tomorrow. Each of us has the power to influence and change the world, to make a difference. Recognizing that we have this agency is what should give us hope.	https://kyivindependent.com/anne-applebaum-russia-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-unstable-autocracies/	2024-10-08T11:12:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-186531437.jpg
Trump reportedly spoke with Putin as many as 7 times after out of White House	Former U.S. President Donald Trump secretly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after he left office, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Oct. 8, citing a book by journalist Bob Woodward. According to Woodward&apos;s latest book &quot;War,&quot; the two might have spoken a half-dozen other times after Trump left the White House in 2020, the unnamed aide claimed. Putin and Trump allegedly spoke even as the latter was reportedly pressuring Republicans to block the $60 billion aid package for Kyiv. Trump&apos;s views on Ukraine are causing concern among Ukraine&apos;s partner countries, as the ex-president seeks re-election this November, sparking fears his potential cutting of military support as Ukraine struggles to hold the line against intense Russian offensives. In early 2024, Trump ordered an aide out of his office at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to hold a phone call with Putin, the book alleged. Trump also allegedly secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test devices for personal use at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In a phone conversation with Trump, the Russian president asked his U.S. counterpart not to publicly disclose this information, the NYT reported. &quot;I don&#x2019;t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,&quot; Putin told Trump, according to the book. After the start of the pandemic, Putin drastically reduced his amount of personal contacts, and many of those he met have reportedly been forced to quarantine. The Russian president claimed he had been vaccinated, without elaborating on which vaccine. The Trump campaign denied the reports, calling the stories from the Woodward&apos;s book &#xA0;&quot;made up.&quot; The NYT reported earlier in October that Trump asked Putin for advice when deciding on whether to send arms to Ukraine early during his presidency in 2017. The ex-president has promised to end the full-scale war within a day if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. One plan reportedly involves Kyiv ceding territory to Russia. Kamala Harris, Trump&apos;s Democratic rival, said in an interview aired on Oct. 7 that if she is elected, she would refuse to engage in peace talks with Putin without Ukraine&#x2019;s involvement. Trump met Zelensky during the latter&apos;s visit to the U.S. at the end of September, during which he touted his supposed &quot;good relationship&quot; with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-reportedly-spoke-with-putin-7-times-after-out-of-white-house/	2024-10-08T10:52:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1083470486.jpg
Biden postpones visit to Germany due to hurricane ahead of Ramstein meeting	U.S. President Joe Biden is postponing his upcoming trip to Germany and Angola due to the approach of Hurricane Milton, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said on Oct. 8. Biden was supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12, where President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to present his victory plan. The U.S. president put off his visit in order to oversee the emergency response to Hurricane Milton, according to the spokesperson. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming Ramstein meeting will be the first one held on a leader-level. During the last one Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. Zelensky already presented his five-point plan to Biden during his trip to the U.S. in late September. Ukraine&apos;s president also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. Kyiv also may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the Ramstein summit, the Washington Post reported, citing an undisclosed diplomat. On Oct. 2, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. had reviewed Ukraine&apos;s victory plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps&quot; there. &quot;The victory plan that Ukraine presented is not just a question of actions that Ukraine would take. It&#x2019;s a question of actions that other countries around the world would take as well,&quot; Miller said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-3/	2024-10-08T09:40:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175587602.jpg
Hungary blocks EU sanctions changes, holding up $50 billion G7 loan package for Ukraine	The landmark decision to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan from the profits of frozen Russian assets has been held up after Hungarian Finance Minister Mihaly Varga announced the blocking of necessary changes to the European Union&apos;s sanctions regime on Oct. 8. During the June Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed a deal on the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year, which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. The funds for covering the loan will not come from the confiscation of Russian assets themselves, but through profits generated by them and accumulated over time. According to EU officials, Washington is demanding that the EU change the rules for renewing sanctions against Russia from every six months to every three years as a condition to contribute about $20 billion to the G7 loan, halving the EU&apos;s own contribution. The remaining $10 billion will be provided by G7 members Canada, the U.K., and Japan. &quot;We believe that this issue, the prolongation of the Russian sanctions, should be decided after the U.S. elections. We have to see in which direction the future U.S. administration is going with this issue,&quot; the minister said. The 2024 U.S. presidential elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. Explaining Hungary&apos;s position, Varga said that the two presidential candidates &#x2014; Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have different views on how to support Ukraine in the future, and that Europeans should wait for the election results to see what course Washington will take. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. The vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-to-hold-up-50-billion-g7-loan-for-ukraine-until-after-the-us-election/	2024-10-08T08:44:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2170911681.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 150	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 150 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Sept. 29 &#x2013; Oct. 5, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Cabinet completes the composition of UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board. On Oct. 4, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Timur Bondaryev as an independent member of Ukrainian Defense Industry&#x2019;s (UDI) supervisory board. This appointment completes the composition of the board, liga.net explained. Timur Bondaryev is the founding and managing partner of Arzinger Law Firm, as well as a senior lecturer at the department of private law at the Kyiv Mohyla Academy. As we wrote in June 2023, the State Concern Ukroboronprom was dissolved and replaced by a joint-stock company called Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI). See Issue 95 for more detail. In January 2024, we reported that the Cabinet of Ministers appointed UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board. Oleksiy Honcharuk and Serhiy Konovets are independent members, while Tymofiy Mylovanov, David Lomjaria, and Linndy Smith are state representatives. On Jan. 16, Lomjaria was elected as the board chair. See Issue 115 for more detail. Note that according to UDI&#x2019;s charter, the supervisory board should consist of six members: half of the board must be made up of independent members, and the other half, of state representatives. Note also that we are not aware of any public information on the competitive selection for UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board, in particular, the selection of its independent members. NABU completes the pre-trial investigation into the Sennychenko case, says SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices embezzled millions. On Ot. 4, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) announced that they had completed their investigation into a criminal group run by the former head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) in 2019-2021. Although NABU or SAPO do not name the suspect, Dmytro Sennychenko was the SPFU head during that period. NABU and SAPO said that the group embezzled more than Hr 700 million (roughly, 23 million euros at the average exchange rate over the period to which the investigation refers) from state-owned enterprises, including the Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and the United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC), as well as laundered Hr 10 billion (around 333 million euros) in 2019-2021. As we reported in March 2023, NABU and SAPO said that they had exposed a criminal group run by Sennychenko. See our Issue 80 for detail. Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022. Back then, Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) contacted Sennychenko for comment, and he replied that he would &#x201C;definitely provide a comment after consultations with a legal team,&quot; which he said would take several days. We are not aware of any public comments by Sennychenko since March 2023. As we reported in Issue 83, the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list in April 2023. In November 2023, we wrote that NABU and SAPO filed additional suspicions against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalizing criminal proceeds of over Hr 10 billion (around 333 million euros in 2019-2021). According to NABU, Sennychenko&#x2019;s accomplices included: In addition, on Dec. 12, 2023, NABU and SAPO served a notice of suspicion to Denys Kudin, former first deputy head of the SPFU. (He also served on the supervisory board of OPZ. See our Issue 114 for detail. In February 2023, Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Serhiy Koretskiy wrote that Kudin, who had recently stepped down as first deputy economy minister, was appointed to head Ukrnafta&#x2019;s department for strategy, development, and government relations. See Issue 75 for more detail. Kudin worked with Koretskiy for the WOG chain of petrol stations in 2013-2018. Kudin has been the first deputy economy minister since November 2021. Before that, he was first deputy head of SPFU. On the same day, Dec. 12, 2023, Kudin confirmed that he had received the notice of suspicion. He stated that he would prove his innocence via legal means. On Jan. 17, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) court set bail for Kudin at Hr 9 million (around 218,000 euros at that time), after which he posted on Facebook that he did not agree with the court ruling and would challenge it in an appellate court. We are not aware of any statements by Kudin on his criminal case since then. As we reported in May 2024 (Issue 131), the HACC ordered detention for Sennychenko, who is wanted internationally. PrivatBank sells petrol stations and land plots, previously controlled by Kolomoisky, for almost Hr 700 million ($16.9 million). On Sept. 27, PrivatBank held an auction on the SETAM platform for the sale of 245 petrol stations and 33 land plots located in 21 oblasts, EP reported. Back in 2016, PrivatBank, then controlled by the Privat group associated with tycoons Ihor Kolomoisky and Hennadiy Boholyubov, received 120 oil depots and 248 petrol stations as collateral at the request of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). During August-September 2016, the bank leased all of them to companies related to its former shareholders. The lessees then subleased them to other companies associated with the Privat group. On Dec. 18, 2016, PrivatBank was nationalized due to a shortage of funds and the risk of bankruptcy. For the first four months after the nationalization, PrivatBank received payments under leasing agreements, but the borrowers then stopped paying. This forced PrivatBank to start the process of terminating these agreements and regaining control over the petrol stations in 2019-2020. The court allowed PrivatBank to seize 245 of these stations in November 2023. According to EP and Forbes Ukraine, most of the former ANP and Avias petrol stations controlled by the Privat group were put up for sale. The winner offered Hr 695.9 million ($16.9 million), which was only 0.3% more than the starting price. The winner undertook to pay in full within 10 banking days. The winner&#x2019;s name was not disclosed on the SETAM platform. However, according to EP, it is a little-known company Max Energy Resource LLC, founded and owned by Ihor Suprunenko. Max Energy Resource only started importing fuel after the outbreak of the full-scale war, when the EU became a dominant source of fuel supplies to Ukraine, EP added. According to Suprunenko, the company only imports petroleum products and is not part of any oligarchic groups. He added that Max Energy Resource has several co-owners but did not disclose their identities. In his interview with EP, Suprunenko also stated that the company&#x2019;s 2023 revenue was approximately Hr 1.5 billion (37.9 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). He explained that the main goal of the purchase was to develop the network. &#x201C;We want to take a certain segment in the petroleum products market, increase competition, and supply quality fuel,&#x201D; he said. Suprunenko said the company planned to launch up to half of the petrol stations they acquired over the next year, with 55-60 petrol stations in the first stage (six months) and another 50-60 stations in the second stage. The remainder required restoration, and about 50 petrol stations were either destroyed or located in the occupied territories, he clarified. According to Suprunenko, a total of Hr 1.2 billion ($29 million) will be invested in the project over the first year, which includes the above Hr 700 million ($16.9 million) to be paid for petrol stations. Max Energy Resource has yet to obtain a merger clearance from the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine, he added. UDI to cooperate with four NATO arms companies. On Oct. 2, UDI reported that it signed partnership documents with arms companies from the U.S., France, and Poland. The partnership includes cooperation in the areas of ammunition and special chemicals, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as electronic intelligence and electronic warfare. UDI did not disclose the names of the companies, probably for security reasons. As we wrote in Issue 114, during 2023, Ukrainian state-owned defense companies reported that they started manufacturing new weapons and signed cooperation and joint production contracts with various counterparts in NATO member states.&#x202F;See Issues 74, 79, 88, 91, 97, 105, 108, and 111 for more detail. Land Bank holds first auctions, leases state agricultural land for Hr 35 million ($849,000). On Oct. 1, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) reported the results of the first 16 online auctions for sublease of state agricultural land within the Land Bank project. According to the SPFU, 94 bidders competed for 16 land plots in Vinnytsia Oblast with a total area of 1,075 hectares. The total value of the sublease increased by more than eight times compared to the starting prices. The average sublease price was Hr 33,000 ($801) per hectare, the SPFU added. The sum of the winning bids was slightly over Hr 35 million ($849,000), and 10 bidders won the auctions. They must sign sublease agreements within 20 working days and then pay the price of the assets plus VAT within the next five working days. Then, they will obtain the right to use the land plots for a period of 14 years, the SPFU explained. By the end of 2024, another 1,900 auctions are planned for more than 100,000 hectares in 20 oblasts. As we reported in June 2023, the SPFU was working out plans to centralize state property management, which included setting up a land bank (see Issue 93). We then wrote that the Cabinet transferred 25 SOEs, previously managed by the National Academy of Agrarian Science, to the SPFU on Aug. 11, 2023. (see Issue 100). In June 2024, the Cabinet took away 2,764 agricultural land plots with a total area of more than 104,000 hectares from SOEs. The SPFU-managed Agrarian Investment Fund was given control. The SPFU then announced that preparations for the Land Bank were complete. The next step was to corporatize the Agrarian Investment Fund, so it could act as a land auction operator (see Issue 136). In August, the SPFU completed the corporatization of the Agrarian Investment Fund, creating State Land Bank LLC on its basis (see Issue 144). Shortly after that, the SPFU-managed State Land Bank announced the first 16 auctions on Prozorro.Sale for the lease of state agricultural land (see Issue 145). Starting from July 1, 2021, Ukrainian citizens can legally buy and sell agricultural land. However, the sale and purchase of state-owned and communal agricultural land remain banned.

Second Russian strike hits Kharkiv in a day, deaths, injuries reported	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Russian forces attacked a densely populated area of the city of Kharkiv with a guided aerial bomb on Oct. 8, killing at least two people and injuring three others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The attack is the second strike on Kharkiv to cause civilian casualties in the day. Earlier in the morning, another attack injured more than 20 people, including a 16-year-old child. The city&apos;s Mayor Ihor Terekhov said that according to preliminary data Russia hit a multi-story building in the second attack. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kharkiv-2nd-time-in-a-day-casualties-reported/	2024-10-08T07:49:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1388000475.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 76	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 76 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Sept. 30- Oct. 6, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The CMU formed a competition commission to select the Bureau of Economic Security director. On Oct. 4, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed a competition commission to select a new director of the Bureau of Economic Security. Three members of the Commission, selected by the Cabinet of Ministers, are representatives of academic institutions: Members of the commission submitted by the international partners are: The Tax Committee approved the draft law on tax increase, the final reading is scheduled for this week. On Oct. 4, the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy approved for the second reading draft law #11416-d on the record high increase of taxes. The key provisions haven&#x2019;t changed, such as: increase of the military levy from 1.5% to 5%; introduction of a military levy for individual entrepreneurs; 50% tax on bank profits; increase of minimal land tax; 25% profit tax for financial companies; cash back tax exemption; transition to monthly income tax reporting for economic reservation of conscripts. Overall 1,388 amendments to the draft law were submitted in the second reading. So far, the Cabinet of Ministers denied a suggestion to replace (at least partly) the increase of the military levy with an increase of value-added tax. Also, all provisions will come into force retroactively from Oct. 1. The draft law is included to the agenda of the Verkhovna Rada&#x2019;s plenary week scheduled for Oct. 8-11. The CMU fulfilled another one benchmark from the Memorandum with the IMF. On Sept. 30, the last day of the deadline, the Finance Minitry adopted the methodology to evaluate tax incentives and their financial impact on the state budget. It&#x2019;s structural benchmark #24 of the Memorandum with the International Monetary Fund. According to the document, the Finance Ministry adopted the relevant resolution on Sept. 27. This week the parliament will consider several draft laws within the Ukraine Plan. During the parliamentary meetings scheduled for oct. 8-11, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, will consider two draft laws which were designed to fulfill Ukraine&#x2019;s obligations under the Ukraine Facility financial mechanism. First of all, the parliament will vote on the final reading of draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy. Second, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the first reading the resubmitted revised draft law #12039 on plea agreements. The new draft law was designed to take into account all warnings of the anticorruption experts regarding the previous draft law on this matter. Ukraine made several steps to meet two requirements of the Ukraine Plan. Last week, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted the Strategy of Demographic Development until 2040 and signed the technical task for the development of an IT-system to ensure the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Public Utilities performs its functions. Both steps were made to meet two indicators of the Ukraine Plan within the Ukraine Facility mechanism, which deadlines were scheduled for the third quarter. The Cabinet fulfilled these obligations on the last day of the scheduled deadline. The Tax Committee recommended for the 2nd reading draft laws on establishing a bank of development. On Oct. 4, the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy approved for the first reading draft laws #11238 and #11239 on establishing a National Development Agency (submitted by Danylo Hetmantsev and other lawmakers). As we reported in Issue 58, according to draft laws, the National Development Agency is aimed to be a state specialized institution with a special mandate for the recovery and structural transformation of the economy, which will implement lending programs for the recovery of the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-76/	2024-10-08T07:17:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1643784979--2-.jpg
Russian forces outnumbered Ukrainians tenfold in battle for Vuhledar, commander says	Russian troops committed to the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast outnumbered defending Ukrainian forces by around 9:1, Oleksandr Okhrimenko, commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, said in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Glavkom published on Oct. 8. Kyiv announced the withdrawal from Vuhledar on Oct. 2, after Russian forces first swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and then entered its urban area. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade had defended Vuhledar, one of the key strongholds of Ukraine&apos;s defense of southern Donetsk Oblast, for over two years without rotations. Located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vuhledar has faced a heavy Russian onslaught since 2022. According to Okhrimenko, Moscow deployed Russia&apos;s 36th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, 39th Brigade, 57th Brigade, 91st Separate Rifle Regiment and other units to the final assault Vuhledar. &quot;The enemy&apos;s forces had superiority in tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, anti-tank weapons, and personnel,&quot; the commander said. The attacking side can gain an advantage on the battlefield if it has three times as many forces and means as the other one, Okhrimenko said, referring to a ballpark ratio commonly upheld in military doctrine around the world. &quot;It was 1:9 in Vuhledar. You can objectively understand the chances to hold this settlement and the line of defense in the brigade&apos;s sector of responsibility,&quot; he added. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Apart from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-outnumbered-ukraines-tenfold-in-battle-for-vuhledar-commander-says/	2024-10-08T07:15:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175895776-1.jpg
Top medical official in Kyiv suspected of faking disability certificates for draft-age men	The head of one of the inter-district Centers for Medical and Social Experts in Kyiv will appear in court for allegedly handing out fake disability certificates, the police said on Oct. 8. The falsified documents allowed draft-age men to delay mobilization and travel abroad, according to the statement. The centers are responsible for establishing the degree of disability after an injury or illness, which applies to both military and civilians. They can also issue exemptions from military service based on health conditions. As Ukraine ramps up its mobilization efforts, various illicit schemes involving falsified medical documents to help men avoid the draft have only mounted. The official, whose identity was not revealed, was charged with forgery and illegal trafficking of individuals across Ukraine&#x2019;s state border. Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not allowed to travel abroad under martial law without permission. The suspect falsified medical reports with fake diagnoses for men otherwise eligible for duty to evade conscription, the police believe. If convicted, the accused could face a maximum sentence of up to seven years in prison. During searches, law enforcement officers seized more than $25,000 and 1,600 euros in the suspect&#x2019;s apartment.	https://kyivindependent.com/medical-official-kyiv/	2024-10-08T06:20:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Test.jpg
Two months into Ukraine’s Kursk offensive, anger in Russia's border regions fuels war support	Ever since Ukraine launched a lightning incursion deep into Russia territory in early August, Yan, a local resident in the city of Kursk, has been volunteering at a local drop-off point, helping to distribute clothes and bedding. &quot;The number of people arriving at the humanitarian aid points every week is increasing,&quot; Yan, his full name withheld so as to speak freely, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Now, with the cold weather setting in, the need for warm clothes and insulated bedding has become very urgent, whilst food parcels and hygiene products remain important,&quot; he added. For two months now, Ukrainian troops have been in control of dozens of settlements in Russia&#x2019;s border region, with refugees continuing to pour into the Kursk Oblast&#x2019;s provincial capital as fierce fighting in the west of the region continues. The Kursk offensive, which comes as Ukraine increasingly strikes Moscow&apos;s military assets deep inside Russia, has demonstrated Kyiv&apos;s ability to bring about a new phase of the war in the third year of Russia&#x2019;s brutal all-out invasion. But some analysts warn these audacious tactics, rather than presenting a thorn in the Kremlin&apos;s side, only fuel war support in the regions affected. &quot;The logic that by trying to target Russian society and make life in the country unbearable will turn Russians against the Kremlin is flawed. In fact, the more the situation appears threatening, the more they will stand with the state,&quot; Tatyana Stanovaya, an analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told the Kyiv Independent. On Wednesday, Russian forces captured the city of Vuhledar in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast. The loss of the strategic city, which has bore the brunt of heavy fighting for over two years, symbolizes the slow and grinding advances of Russian forces in Ukraine&apos;s east. The incursion into Kursk was Kyiv&apos;s attempt to redress that momentum, drawing Russian forces away from the country&#x2019;s east and boosting morale across Ukraine. It was also meant to show Ukraine&#x2019;s Western backers that Russian &#x201C;red lines&#x201D; are not backed by action, potentially helping Kyiv to receive permission to strike Russian territory with Western-made missiles. President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the situation in Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk regions following an invasion of Ukrainian troops in the course of the Russia-Ukraine conflict via video link at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia on Aug. 22, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP)&quot;What it has done is show our partners what we&#x2019;re capable of. We have also shown the Global South that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who claims to have everything under control, in fact, does not,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the Kursk incursion in an interview with The New Yorker. In recent weeks, Ukraine has also stepped up its strikes deep inside Russian territory, taking out three munitions depots. Satellite imagery showed the burnt-out Oktyabrsky and Toropets storage facilities in the Tver Oblast, as well as the Tikhoretsk depot in the Krasnodar Krai, all but destroyed following a series of drone strikes. And whilst disrupting Moscow&apos;s ability to carry out its war of aggression, Stanovaya argues this tactic has one major side effect &#x2013; the Russian population gets accustomed to war and wants it to continue until some sort of victory is achieved. What victory means for them, is rarely crystallized. &quot;One of the most significant outcomes of the Kursk attack may be a reinforcement of anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western sentiment, which in turn could boost support for Putin and prolong the war,&quot; she wrote in a report on R.Politik, a website providing analysis into Russian affairs. In July, hopes for a speedy end to the conflict among Russians polled at a record high of 58% of the population. In the wake of the Kursk offensive, that figure dwindled to 49%, according to Russian pollster the Levada Centre, seen as autonomous from government interference. This uptick in war support comes as Ukraine reportedly looks for an off ramp from the war that has ravaged the country for almost a thousand days. In a landmark trip to the U.S in late September, Zelensky unveiled a &quot;victory&quot; plan to the U.S. President Joe Biden. &quot;After 10 years of war, including two and a half years of full-scale war, people are getting tired,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Despite this, we have no other option but to continue to fight and persevere. It&#x2019;s a war of attrition, and to survive and win, we need to outlast the enemy. It&#x2019;s the only way,&quot; Merezhko added.

(Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)A desire to want to end the war, but also recognising the need to keep fighting it, was also highlighted in further polling across Russia in October. Research carried out by &#x415;xtremeScan and the Chronicles project, which conducted telephone interviews across the country between July and September, showed that roughly half of the respondents supported a truce in the next year if Putin decides to end the war even with the country&#x2019;s military goals unfulfilled. Yet, many have questioned the efficacy of polling in wartime Russia, where strict laws prohibit any criticism of what the Kremlin calls its &#x201C;special military operation.&#x201D; &quot;(Polling) as a thermometer of the will of the Russian people has zero validity,&quot; Greg Yudin, professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Under authoritarian conditions, it is explicitly prescribed not to have any preferences,&quot; Yudin added in a paper that rebutted figures about President Putin&apos;s popularity ratings in Russian media outlet Important Stories. But residents of the border regions who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on conditions of anonymity demonstrated a sharpened anger at Ukraine and a desire among some to want to settle the war militarily. In Kursk, where tens of thousands of refugees have arrived since the beginning of August, many believe that a drawn-out war may be the only way to eventually return to normality. &quot;People orient themselves around the views of the (government-controlled) media. The mood is very much, let&apos;s end this one so we can return home,&quot; said a lawyer from Kursk Oblast who has recently moved to Leningrad Oblast due to cross-border shelling. &quot;(People) blame the Ukrainian army and its government, believing that because of their actions, they find themselves internally displaced,&quot; Yan said. &quot;They want to return home. They recognise this is only possible if the territories where they lived are liberated by military means,&quot; he added. &quot;The invasion of the Kursk Oblast and the raids in Belgorod Oblast politically make these regions the most &apos;militaristic,&apos; ultra-patriotic and anti-Ukrainian,&#x201D; said independent sociologist Alexey Gusev. Two years ago, shortly after the Kremlin announced its mobilization drive, the lawyer from Kursk who spoke to the Kyiv Independent left Russia due to fears he may be called up to fight. He saw little reason why he should be forced to fight in a war beyond Russia&apos;s borders, especially one that he did not support. Since returning to Russia, the lawyer now admits that the Kursk incursion has made avoiding the war more difficult. &quot;I believed that my country didn&apos;t need defending, even as someone who completed military service and promised to defend my country. But now, even though it is a small part of my country, it is a part of my country that has been attacked,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, it is difficult to say what people think about peace negotiations. In my opinion, people just want Russian territory to be returned to Russia. That is the minimum,&quot; he added. And despite discussions in Washington D.C. and a pivotal U.S. presidential election on the horizon, Merezhko said the time for negotiation talks could still be some way off. &quot;I don&#x2019;t believe that right now Putin is ready for any negotiations. He is not interested in peace, because peace creates danger for his stay in power,&quot; he said. &quot;There can be a peace through strength approach applied to Putin when the pressure on him on the battlefield and from sanctions is high enough to make him stop the aggression,&quot; Merezhko added. But for now, Kyiv&apos;s attempts to notch up that pressure, only takes us further away from any prospects for peace, Stanovaya said. &quot;The more dangerous the situation becomes, the more robust the support for the authorities in Russia will be. So it decreases Russia&apos;s willingness to talk to Ukraine,&quot; she said. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/two-months-into-ukraines-kursk-offensive-anger-in-russias-border-regions-fuels-war-support/	2024-10-08T06:07:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
As signs of talks about West Germany model for Ukraine peace emerge, experts weigh in on feasibility	Ukraine is seeking membership in the NATO military alliance as a part of its plan to end Russia&#x2019;s war, and recent reports suggest a West Germany model is seriously being discussed among Kyiv and its allies. During a September visit to the U.S., Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said that accession to the alliance is part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; to cease the bloody battles that have now been raging for more than two and a half years. While Ukraine&#x2019;s long-dreamed NATO membership has widely been dismissed as a non-starter, especially after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the alliance&apos;s former Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the Financial Times that there may be ways to make it possible. &#x201C;If there is a line that is not necessarily the internationally recognized border,&#x201D; Stoltenberg told the FT in an interview published on Oct. 4. Referring to the historical examples of NATO protecting West Germany or Japan&#x2019;s security guarantees from the U.S., Stoltenberg, while warning that &#x201C;no parallels are 100 percent correct,&#x201D; suggested a membership model for Kyiv-controlled parts of Ukraine. Russia currently controls about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory. &#x201C;When there is a will, there are ways to find the solution. But you need a line which defines where Article 5 is invoked, and Ukraine has to control all the territory until that border,&#x201D; he told the FT. His reference to Article 5 relates to the part of the NATO pact treaty that obliges all members to consider an attack on one member of the alliance as an attack on all in the territory defined by Article 6. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Breckelman confirmed that talks are ongoing about the potential peace plan in which the Ukrainian-controlled part of the country enters NATO in the West Germany model. He did not elaborate further on the allies&#x2019; reactions thus far or how far the talks are at this stage. But in an interview aired Monday with CBS News&#x2019; 60 Minutes, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harras, the Democratic party candidate facing off with Donald Trump on the Republican ticket in this autumn&#x2019;s presidential election, suggested that talk of Ukraine joining NATO would be discussed at a later point. Asked if she supported the expansion of NATO to Ukraine, Harris said it was one of the &#x201C;issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point &#x2026; right now, we are supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself against Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked aggression.&#x201D; The issue, along with further weapons supplies for Ukraine, is expected to be further discussed by Western allies at the Oct. 12 Ukraine Defense Contact Group gathering at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, which gathers countries almost monthly to agree upon support for Ukraine, and will this time be convened by U.S. President Joe Biden. The Kyiv Independent asked six experts about the feasibility of a potential NATO membership model without Ukraine regaining control over all of its borders, whether such a peace formula would work, and whether it is actually deliverable or instead being used by the Ukrainian side as a negotiating tactic. a non-resident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) &#x201C;(Regarding the feasibility of the NATO membership on parts of Ukraine) No. First, Ukraine needs to hold more terrain in Kursk (Oblast) and other areas for Russia to be deeply concerned. Second, NATO is too split to make a decisive move. Especially as Hungary and Slovakia deviates from what has been traditional NATO outlooks. Also, it is evident that Hungary sees an opportunity in a Ukrainian downfall to regain the limited areas that have a Hungarian population in Western Ukraine. So Hungary is ready to trade decades of European geopolitical instability for small-minded national chauvinistic goals. There are several countries that firmly believe that a Russian victory will lead to a larger, more devastating war in the near future, so a Russian win-peace plan is no peace; it is the overture and staging for a disaster that will spread over the continent.&#x201D; co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center &#x201C;There are some confusing messages coming from different sources. The official position of the Ukrainian government, President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has been that there will be &#x2018;no trade of territory for a ceasefire, for peace.&#x2019; At the same time, we learned from international sources that first it was a kind of idea, and later on from kind of controlled leaks that there are some negotiations behind closed doors, considering these kinds of options: granting NATO membership for the government control territories in exchange for Ukraine&apos;s government changing position towards these maximalist goals of liberating the whole territory of Ukraine in its international borders. &#x201C;It seems to me that there is a kind of game underway. Definitely, there must be some discussions about a possible compromise. I don&apos;t know whether Ukrainian officials clearly stated their readiness to consider such a compromise. I suppose that, for the moment, there is some discussion like this. The Ukrainian government doesn&apos;t admit it publicly. I don&apos;t know how we can proceed if President Zelensky maintains the same position. &#x201C;It (possible NATO membership on Ukrainian-controlled territories of the country) hardly looks possible at the moment. We all know the position of other NATO members who are not ready to take such a risk. They don&apos;t want to buy a ticket for war. It&apos;s what they see in this proposal if it is to be realized. &#x201C;(A potential NATO membership on Ukrainian-controlled parts being part of a peace formula) could involve negotiating tactics, both with our partners and testing the ground of the possible compromises or negotiations with the Russian Federation. Our international partners are not ready to make such a radical political step; let&apos;s talk about practical decisions of lifting the restrictions or providing more weapons. It&apos;s important to see what the Kremlin&apos;s reaction is. Again, if you assume that there are some closed-door talks or consultations on the second track, maybe these issues are now discussed somewhere in different formats. This is my assumption, and I can&apos;t prove it by any evidence.

(Photo by Libkos/Getty Images)&#x201C;(Regarding the &apos;Victory Plan&apos;) I also assume that Biden&apos;s visit next week or this week to Ramstein (Germany for the Ukraine Defense Contact group talks) is probably one reason that he&apos;s going to meet his European counterparts personally. &#x201C;Maybe he will discuss the details not just limited to Zelensky&apos;s plan of victory but broader because we also know that the White House recently presented its own strategy for Congress, which is also confidential. Maybe that&#x2019;s a format. Ramstein format will be the place where leaders, Ukrainian leaders, European and American leaders will try to find some common ground or to develop at least a common strategy. There can be talks in a wider format because there are 50-plus countries. I don&apos;t think that President Biden is ready to share with all of them all the details. But at least in the NATO format, I think that they will be quite sensitive discussions.&#x201D; retired U.S. Lieutenant General and former Commanding General of US Army Europe &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t comment on the Victory Plan as I have not seen it myself. I will say that I have zero confidence that Russia will ever fully live up to any agreement about Ukraine and therefore it is in the best strategic interest of the West to help defeat Russia and crush its imperialistic ambitions. &#x201C;I would also say that I trust President Zelensky and his judgment about what is best for Ukraine.&#x201D; Ukrainian political analyst &#x201C;Ukraine has not said anywhere that it will leave these territories. It did not publicly announce anywhere that the territories temporarily occupied by Russia would be left behind. &#x201C;Japan does not recognize the occupation of the Kuril Islands, but the rest of Japan&apos;s territory is protected by the U.S. &#x2013; in this case, we are talking about NATO. There is a similar story with Germany. When (partitioned) Germany joined NATO, a part of its territory was covered by Article 5. The rest of the territory joined later. In fact, this is not only about Article 5, but also about Article 6, which states that Ukraine joins NATO, but not the entire territory is covered by this. For example, continental France is covered by protection, but there are some islands that belong to France, somewhere in the distant overseas territories &#x2013; &#xA0;they are, well, not under the umbrella of NATO. And this gives Ukraine the opportunity to try to find the possibility of joining NATO, or at least receiving an invitation. Because Russia&apos;s motivation was to attack Ukraine, so that it did not join NATO, as (Russian Foreign Minister) Lavrov said today in an article in Newsweek, to ensure that Ukraine did not have opportunities and capabilities. &#x201C;But, for example, today, the Moscow Times reported that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not go to his estates in Sochi because Ukrainian drones are flying there. That is, after two and a half years of war, Russia was not able to destroy all military capabilities here (in Ukraine). On the contrary, they grew. &#x201C;Today we have drones that fly to the aurora borealis &#x2013; they can fly two thousand kilometers. Ukraine today has the ability to increase its military capabilities, to produce more weapons and to unite more of the world in order for it to help Ukraine.

(Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;Second, it changed the very essence of the obligation. More than half of the Russian population wants Russia to leave the territory of Ukraine. The so-called &#x2018;special military operation&#x2019; did not achieve any military plans and goals. &#x201C;That&apos;s why Putin may consider agreeing to Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO, for example, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions or the return of usage of the gas pipeline through Ukraine. Therefore, it is possible to negotiate with Russia. Where possible, there is a comprehensive package of agreements. For example, maybe Russia could accept Ukraine joining NATO but with the absence of military bases and nuclear demilitarization, such that Ukraine will not have nuclear weapons. This is a possible scenario. &#x201C;Today there is another problem. Ukraine should be given hope and given a hand. &#x201C;Ukraine should be given a hand of support and help not only with weapons that immediately go to the battlefield. Ukraine is now making enormous contributions to the security situation of the West. But we also need an understanding that you and I stand on these common values, that it is queued up to enter NATO, and there is an application for entry. A partial introduction is a demonstration that we are together and that we are really doing the same job and they are waiting for us there. But (for the West to) just to use Ukraine and say, well, like, &#x2018;Sorry, friends, we helped you, but like no (you can&apos;t enter NATO),&#x2019; well, that would be a very strong blow to pro-Western sentiments (in Ukraine). &#x201C;Ukrainians have greatly contributed to weakening the enemy, the biggest enemy on the European continent. And the Ukrainians say that we would also like to join this big family, but a safe one, because we cannot be in a constant state of war. If Ukraine is left like this in the future, the results can be very negative for everyone.&#x201D; Ukrainian political analyst and Head of the Platform for Social and Humanitarian Initiatives and Innovations &quot;United Coordination Center&quot; &#x201C;I am not aware that such a scenario is in the plan. It seems unlikely to me, because it will not be accepted by (the Ukrainian) society, it will not be accepted by some of the NATO countries that avoid war with the Russian Federation at all costs. It will free Russia&apos;s hands to attack other European countries in a hybrid way now (for example, with Moldova, Armenia, the Balkans and the Baltics), to incite other regions aligned with China&apos;s actions in the Indo-Pacific region. Such a variant of freezing would be an anaesthetic that does not cure but would simply make the destructive processes less visible to the general public and more dangerous.&#x201D; Senior Lecturer in International Politics, Aberystwyth University &#x201C;I believe that Putin is not likely to accept such an offer, trading land in Ukraine for NATO protections for the rest of Ukraine, unless Russia is clearly defeated on the battlefield and Putin believes he has no better options. The whole purpose of invading Ukraine, both in 2014 and afterward, has been to remove Ukraine from NATO&apos;s influence and return it to Russia&apos;s control. &#x201C;Some members of NATO probably would be willing to offer Ukraine full membership or close to the equivalent protection sooner rather than later, although by no means all, in large part out of precisely the concern of a direct military confrontation between NATO and Russia that has dictated the hesitations over providing Ukraine with certain types of weapons or permission to use Western-supplied weapons in certain ways.

(Contributor/Getty Images)&#x201C;Overall, then, I don&apos;t think this proposal has a realistic chance of success. &#x201C;But Zelensky may be using it to try to move his supporters off the fence and push them to make more concrete security guarantees to Kyiv. He may also be trying to score a public relations victory over Putin, who keeps claiming that he is ready to negotiate (although, in fact, he has shown himself unwilling to consider any change in his demands or compromise).&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/as-signs-of-talks-about-west-germany-model-for-ukraine-peace-emerge-experts-weigh-in-on-feasibility/	2024-10-08T06:04:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161661645.jpg
UK slaps sanctions on Russian forces for chemical weapons use in Ukraine	The United Kingdom issued sanctions against Russian units involved in the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, the country&apos;s Foreign Office said on Oct. 8. Russia&apos;s Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defence Troops and their chief, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, were among those sanctioned, with two Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers also on the list. Russia&apos;s use of gas attacks is rising, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed. In January, 229 cases were recorded compared to 639 in June and 358 in July, according to the Ukrainian military&apos;s Support Forces, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has recorded over 4,000 cases of Russian chemical agents used on Ukraine&apos;s front line, including over 3,100 reported cases since December 2023. &quot;The U.K. will not sit idly by whilst (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his mafia state ride roughshod over international law, including the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement. &quot;The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces&apos; desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,&quot; the U.S. Department of State said in May, asserting that Moscow has violated the Chemical Weapons Convention by deploying riot control agents as a method of warfare.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-forces-for-chemical-weapons/	2024-10-08T05:37:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1240855736.jpg
Cuba asks to join BRICS as partner country in letter to Putin	Cuba has requested to join the BRICS group as a &quot;partner country&quot; in an official letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Cuban Foreign Ministry official said on Oct. 8. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. &quot;Cuba has officially requested to join the BRICS as a &apos;partner country&apos; through a letter to the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who holds the presidency of the group,&quot; said Carlos M. Pereira, the director of bilateral relations at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, in an X post shared by the ministry&apos;s official account. Russian Ambassador to Cuba Viktor Koronelli also told the Russian state agency TASS on Oct. 7 that Havana has officially applied for a partnership with BRICS. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined the international organization at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. The &quot;partner country&quot; status, which does not mean full membership, has been promoted by BRICS diplomats as an alternative way to engage countries of the Global South. Cuba requested to join the organization as a full member in 2023 but did not receive a positive response. The Caribbean island country ruled for decades by the communist party has deepened cooperation with Moscow over their shared rivalry with the U.S. Russian warships briefly docked at Cuba in June as a likely demonstration of strength to Washington, which has backed Ukraine against Russian invasion forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/cuba-asks-to-join-brics-as-partner/	2024-10-08T05:20:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1618574407.jpeg
Ukraine's SBU investigating director of controversial 'Russians at War' documentary Trofimova	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened an investigation of Anastasia Trofimova, the Russian director of the documentary Russians at War, said Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, head of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, on Oct. 7. Canadian-Russian director Trofimova&apos;s documentary has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. The movie was brought into the spotlight when it appeared on the official list of screenings at the prestigious Venice and Toronto film festivals. &#xA0; Trofimova is investigated on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories. The Kyiv Independent requested a press copy of the film for review, but we were not provided with one. According to testimonies, the movie portrays Russian soldiers in Ukraine as ordinary people, never shows or mentions the war crimes committed by them in Ukraine, and subtly questions the truthfulness of Ukrainian testimonies of them. Earlier in her career, Trofimova worked for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet. At first, Toronto Film Festival organizers decided to pull the film from the schedule, citing security concerns, but later decided to hold a special screening for the film after the end of the festival in September, drawing widespread criticism. Trofimova received $340,000 from the Canada Media Fund for her movie. Although Yurchyshyn welcomed Canadian lawmakers&apos; conclusion that Canada should not fund such films, he initiated the case to be opened against Trofimova because &quot;it is Ukraine that should be the first to initiate Trofimova&apos;s case.&quot; The Ukrainian lawmaker also said that he would aim for &quot;a tougher punishment for violating the Ukrainian law&quot; than merely suspending Canadian tax-payer money to finance her movies.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-investigating-trofimova/	2024-10-08T04:40:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170326498.jpg
North Korea likely sending soldiers to Ukraine to aid Russia, Seoul says	North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to help Russia, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers on Oct. 8, the Yonhap news agency reported. &quot;As Russia and North Korea have signed a mutual treaty akin to a military alliance, the possibility of such a deployment is highly likely,&quot; the minister said in the parliament. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. Asked about a recent report by Ukrainian media that North Korean service members were killed and injured near occupied Donetsk, Kim said that this is also likely true. The group of North Korean soldiers arrived in the Russian-held part of Ukraine to exchange experience with their Russian counterparts, Interfax-Ukraine reported on Oct. 4, citing a military intelligence source. Six were reportedly killed and three injured in a missile attack. &quot;We believe there have been injuries and fatalities among North Korean troops in Ukraine,&quot; Kim said, according to Politico. North Korea has been supplying Russia with vast quantities of artillery shells and with ballistic missiles during the full-scale war. Moscow&apos;s military strategy requires large quantities of artillery shells fired to destroy the opponent&apos;s positions or prepare ground assaults. There have also been reports of North Korean military or police personnel traveling to join &quot;reconstruction efforts&quot; in occupied Donbas in early 2023 and plans to send military trainers in July this year. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year. &quot;The relations between Russia and North Korea are evolving to be almost as close as a military alliance,&quot; Kim said. &quot;As such, more North Korean troops could be deployed in the war, from how we look at it.&quot; There were no details on the scale of support North Korean soldiers are expected to provide to Russia in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-likely-sending-soldiers-to-ukraine-to-aid-russia-seoul-says/	2024-10-08T03:33:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2157616618.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure around 50 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 49 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on the morning of Oct. 8. Ukrainian air defenses shot 18 attack drones across various regions, the Air Force said. Russian forces struck Odesa with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles from the occupied Crimea, targeting its port infrastructure. The missile hit a Palau-flagged civilian vessel, killing a 60-year-old worker and injuring five, all foreign citizens. This is the second such attack in recent days by Russia on civilian vessels in the port. One person died, and seven were injured in Sloviansk in Donetsk Oblast when Russian forces hit a residential building. Among the injured is a 2-year-old girl. Four people were injured in Kostiantynivka and one in Sontsivka. Six people were wounded as a result of Russian strikes in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Local authorities reported 392 strikes on 13 settlements in the region. Russian military targeted educational institutions, a cultural institution, a library, and an administrative building in Kherson Oblast. As a result of the attack, 14 high-rise buildings and 15 private houses, as well as private cars, were damaged. As a result of the strikes, one person died, and 24 more were injured, four of whom were children, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 35-year-old man and 57-year-old woman were injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast on Oct. 7, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Sumy Oblast, 143 explosions were reported, mainly by artillery, mortar fire, drones, and glide bombs. There was no mention of casualties. Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Luhansk, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-5/	2024-10-08T02:48:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Donetsk-Oblast-Oct-8.jpg
