Supervisory board extend arms procurement head's contract, initiates audit following proposed merger	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) extended a 1-year contract to Maryna Bezrukova, the current director of the DPA, the agency announced on Jan. 21. The contract extensions comes after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov walked back on plans to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency, following a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards established &quot;to perform their tasks and supporting their independence and anti-corruption policies.&quot; In addition to the contract extension, the board said in a statement that it had initiated a &quot;comprehensive audit of the Agency&apos;s activities,&quot; which will involved NATO&apos;s International Board of Auditors (IBAN). Bezrukova, whose contract was extended by a unanimous vote, is a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, before being appointed to head the DPA. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing.	https://kyivindependent.com/supervisory-board-extend-arms-procurement-heads-contract-initiates-audit-following-proposed-merger/	2025-01-21T14:59:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01371.jpg
Albania signs 10-year security cooperation agreement with Ukraine	Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 10-year security cooperation agreement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. The wide-ranging agreement includes cooperation between the two countries in areas including defense, intelligence sharing, cyber security, nuclear safety, as well as mutual support for each others accession into the European Union, among other topics. &quot;Albania reaffirms its unwavering support for Ukraine&apos;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as of 1991,&quot; the agreement reads, adding that the document does not &quot;substitute for Ukraine&#x2019;s future membership in NATO.&quot; &quot;Albania has been providing military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and it will continue its support throughout the ten-year term of the agreement,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;I am grateful to Albania for supporting our European integration path, strengthening our positions on the battlefield, and bringing us closer to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.&quot; As Albania&apos;s military support for Ukraine continues, the agreement notes that Albania will &quot;continue to support Ukraine in the same way as in 2022-2024.&quot; The agreement also committed Albania into its participation in the fighter jet coalition, an allied initiative helping Ukraine acquire U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets and the necessary training. &quot;Albania will make its contribution to the fighter jet coalition by providing English language training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians,&quot; the agreement reads. Albania, a member of NATO, previously signed a joint cooperation agreement with Ukraine in February 2024. A few days prior on Jan. 19, Tirana opened its first embassy in Ukraine, establishing the country&apos;s first permanent diplomatic mission in Kyiv since the two countries entered into diplomatic relations in 1993.	https://kyivindependent.com/albania-signs-10-year-security-cooperation-agreement-with-ukraine/	2025-01-21T13:46:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/174cb142ba68ea04f71ed9529473c5e2_1709114474_extra_large.jpeg
Syria reportedly cancels deal with Russian construction firm following Assad's downfall	Syria&apos;s port of Tartus has terminated a 49-year investment agreement with Russian construction company Stroytransgaz, the independent Russian outlet Important Stories reported on Jan. 21, citing Riad Joudeh, head of customs in the city of Tartus. The decision follows the collapse of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime on Dec. 8, after a swift offensive by opposition forces that captured Damascus, significantly undermining Russia&#x2019;s influence in Syria. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. The new Syrian government has also blocked a Russian vessel from evacuating military equipment from the Tartus naval base, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 9. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha discussed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the same day that Kyiv and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not revealed.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-reportedly-cancels-russian-investment-agreement-for-tartus-port-modernization/	2025-01-21T13:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
Ukraine-Russia peace deal would require at least 200,000 peacekeepers, Zelensky says	At least 200,000 European soldiers would be required to serve as peacekeepers on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing,&quot; Zelensky said during the panel. Zelensky&apos;s comments comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to quickly negotiate the end of the war. Although a detailed plan has not yet been proposed, the deal that would likely require the presence of European peacekeepers. Trump, who has previously stressed he needs to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first, is working to actively arrange a meeting with Ukraine, Zelensky said. During his remarks in Davos, Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. Zelensky ruled out Moscow&apos;s demand of reducing the size of the country&apos;s military in order to achieve a peace deal. The new U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Earlier in his remarks, Zelensky called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-would-require-at-least-200-000-peacekeepers-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T13:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/f798ed2187a644a475ac0e3db9836c62_1692023126_extra_large.jpeg
Following Trump's inauguration, Russian pundits and politicians show some enthusiasm, some reserve	Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, issuing a short statement before the start of the inauguration ceremony in Washington. &quot;We were always ready to support relations of equal cooperation with any American administration,&quot; Putin told members of the country&apos;s National Security Council in a call on Jan. 20, claiming that Russia was &quot;open to dialogue on the &apos;Ukrainian conflict,&apos;&quot; a name used by the Kremlin for the war it wages against Ukraine. Later reporting suggested that Trump&apos;s team was already preparing a call with Putin, which could take place &quot;very quickly.&quot; On the following day, however, Putin&apos;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov denied any preparations. Russian parliamentarians, whose role is diminished to approving Putin&apos;s agenda and attacking his enemies, on Jan. 20 showed signs of reserve. Trump simply &quot;doesn&apos;t have a final stance&quot; on the war, according to Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, which has little to no real power in the country. This would explain why Trump didn&apos;t mention Russia&apos;s war a single time in his inauguration speech, Kosachev argued. This also means that improving Russian-American relations &quot;will be difficult,&quot; said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Russian Parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs. Slutsky, the leader of one of the country&apos;s pro-Putin political parties, blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for the tarnished relations between the two countries. The U.S. will remain &quot;hostile to Russia,&quot; said Russian Senator Andrey Klishas. Kremlin pundits, meanwhile, didn&apos;t turn their tune, blaming Ukraine for, well, everything. Olga Skabeeva, the host of a popular evening talk show, connected with Ekaterina Moore, a Washington correspondent for Russian state-controlled media, who demonstrated her invitation to Trump&apos;s inauguration on air. &quot;They invited you, but neither (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky nor (French President Emmanuel) Macron,&quot; Skabeeva commented, passing next to the fact that Putin was not invited either. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council Meeting in Igora ski resort, north of Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Dec. 26, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)Zelensky, in addition, would have been desperate to receive an invitation, according to Skabeeva, who quoted Donald Trump Jr, the son of the current U.S. president, who has been actively attacking Kyiv online. Fellow pundit Vladimir Solovyev, on his end, reposted a publication on Telegram according to which &quot;Trump mentioned democracy 637 times and Ukraine not a single time&quot; in his inauguration speech. In another post, Solovyev attacked Biden, claiming that the ex-president needed to pardon former U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci because U.S. Covid vaccines had &quot;side effects, which were ordered to stay silent on.&quot; Biden&apos;s last-minute presidential pardons were also a topic for Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who claimed that these decrees were &quot;self-incriminating.&quot; Zakharova also welcomed Trump&apos;s executive order on the recognition of only two genders, insinuating that under Biden, the U.S. government had been actively promoting non-binary identities in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, &quot;many people&apos;s lives were broken,&quot; Zakharova claimed. Back on Skabeeva&apos;s evening show, Russian parliamentarian and political scientist Andrey Isayev saw this year&apos;s Inauguration Day as a &quot;competition between Trumpists and globalists.&quot; Russian propaganda&apos;s talking points have long been similar to the ones expressed by right and far-right pundits in the U.S. The first group, according to Isayev, is &quot;obviously prevailing.&quot; However, this does not change much for Russia as &quot;both parties fight for Western domination.&quot; With regards to Ukraine, Trump&apos;s presidency would not change much, as the new president &quot;will not leave Europe,&quot; the Russian parliamentarian argued. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the crowd as Vice President J.D. Vance looks at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 20, 2025. (Bill Clark / Pool / Getty Images)Similar arguments came up on the popular pro-war Telegram channel Rybar, which called upon its readers to &quot;judge (U.S. foreign policy) based on concrete decrees and actions in the next three months,&quot; not based on Trump&apos;s inauguration speech. Meanwhile, Kremlin-aligned economists showed hope that sanctions against Russia could be lifted, even if Trump&apos;s policies on Russia could be &quot;tough,&quot; according to industry expert Leonid Khazanov, who was quoted by pro-Kremlin outlet Lenta. For 15 years, Lenta was one of the leading Russian independent news outlets. In 2014, months after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, the news outlet was taken over by the Russian government. Fired journalists left for Riga, Latvia, and founded the Meduza news outlet. Despite Russia&apos;s cautious optimism and lack of outright criticism of the incoming administration, Trump didn&apos;t return the favor. On Jan. 20, Trump said that Putin was &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration.	https://kyivindependent.com/donald-trump-was-long-seen-as-russian-candidate-of-choice-in-moscow-however-reactions-following-inauguration-are-mixed/	2025-01-21T12:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194304549.jpg
Israel proposes sending seized Russian weapons in Lebanon to Ukraine, deputy FM says	Israel&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel proposed transferring Russian weapons seized by Israel in Lebanon to Ukraine during a Jan. 21 meeting with Ukrainian Ambassador Yevhen Korniychuk, Ukraine&apos;s embassy reported. The initiative follows Israel&apos;s September 2024 ground invasion of southern Lebanon as part of its campaign against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. The discussion also addressed military collaboration between Iran and Russia, which poses security risks to both nations. Moscow and Tehran recently formalized their partnership, signing a strategic agreement on Jan. 17. The Ukrainian ambassador thanked Haskel for the proposal, emphasizing the significance of recognizing shared threats faced by Ukraine and Israel. Ukraine&apos;s embassy expressed hope for a positive resolution to the initiative, which it called an important step in strengthening cooperation. Iran has supplied Russia with thousands of Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, weapons frequently used in Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine has supported Israel, expressing solidarity after the deadly attack by Hamas terrorists in October 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/israel-proposes-sending-seized-russian-weapons-in-lebanon-to-ukraine-deputy-fm-says/	2025-01-21T12:20:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/meeing-.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	Key developments on Jan. 21: The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on Facebook that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot; Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission, which determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 21 reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025 &quot;not just quickly but fairly and reliably.&quot; Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelensky stressed the importance of ensuring Ukrainians can safely return home and rebuild their lives. &quot;We want to end the war this year - not just quickly but fairly and reliably for all of us, for Ukrainians,&quot; he said. &quot;So that they can return home, live in safety, and work.&quot; Zelensky underscored the need for strong European engagement, calling for allies to provide accurate information to U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;We have very good relations with President Trump,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;voices conveying disinformation or pro-Russian positions could present risks.&quot; Zelensky also expressed concerns over possible Russian demands in peace negotiations, including calls for Ukraine to reduce its military and abandon NATO membership. Newly inaugurated on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring a swift resolution to the war but acknowledged that consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be necessary. Trump criticized Putin&apos;s handling of the conflict on Jan. 20, claiming he is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal.&quot; The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates leveraging military and political power to secure a just peace. Key speakers include Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Zelensky&apos;s appearance follows his attendance at the January 2024 forum, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, paving the way for the global peace summit later that year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20. Asked about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. Rubio became the first high-level cabinet member of the new Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, making him the new U.S. secretary of state. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said, without specifying what these concessions might be. The chief U.S. diplomat acknowledged that Russia &quot;is the aggressor&quot; but stressed that the war &quot;needs to end.&quot; Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Although Trump vowed during his campaign in 2024 to put an end to the conflict in 24 hours if elected, aides revised the timeframe to the first 100 days after he took office. The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed details on any specific plans to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. An initial proposal leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2013; freezing the war along its current front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2013; has already been rejected by Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-soldier-reports-harsh-conditions-fatal-accidents-in-regiment-unit-launches-investigation/	2025-01-21T12:18:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
Early voting begins in Belarusian presidential election	Early voting began on Jan. 21 in the Belarusian presidential election scheduled for Jan. 26, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The previous election, held in August 2020, was accompanied by large-scale voting fraud and the largest protests in Belarusian history. Most Western governments refused to recognize the 2020 election results and do not consider Alexander Lukashenko the country&apos;s legitimate leader. Lukashenko, who has been in power in Belarus since 1994, announced last year that he intended to run again in the Jan. 26 presidential election. Meanwhile, human rights activists call the early election procedure one of the mechanisms of vote rigging, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Up to 40% of voters usually take part in early voting, and the executive branch determines the number of people who are supposed to participate. Early voting plans are distributed among regions and enterprises, effectively forcing citizens to vote during this period, according to the media outlet. Elections in Belarus &quot;no longer fulfill their functions but are used by the authoritarian government to show a positive picture of general support and thus legalize the authoritarian government,&quot; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, citing human rights activists. Lukashenko claimed victory in the 2020 presidential election, which was widely denounced as rigged in his favor. It was followed by mass protests across the country, which were brutally suppressed by the authorities. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who leads Belarusian democratic forces in exile, said she had won 60% of the vote. The Belarusian dictator is also a close ally of Russia and has backed Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing Belarusian territory as a staging area for Russian invasion troops in 2022. Russia has also been using Belarus to launch missiles against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/early-voting-in-presidential-election-begins-in-belarus/	2025-01-21T12:14:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/4888dde3-a15f-e3f0-3ad7-8b6b4f2b02d9.jpeg
Germany's KNDS launches joint venture with Ukraine for military equipment repair, minister says	Germany&apos;s KNDS Deutschland, a manufacturer of Leopard 2 tanks, has officially opened a joint venture with a Ukrainian defense company, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin reported on Jan. 21. &quot;This will significantly speed up repairs and strengthen our defense capabilities,&quot; he said. The collaboration aims to expedite equipment repairs for Ukrainian armed forces and boost the local economy with investments and job creation. Smetanin noted that Ukrainian specialists have already been trained in Germany, and initial systems have been installed at local facilities. The joint venture aligns with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to localize weapons production. In July 2024, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall also confirmed plans to construct an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The ammunition factory project is expected to take several years to complete, marking a critical step in fortifying Ukraine&apos;s defense infrastructure and deepening its partnerships with Western defense companies amid the ongoing war with Russia. Over the past year, Ukraine has significantly increased its domestic weapon productions, accounting for about 33 - 34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-knds-launches-joint-venture-with-ukraine-for-military-equipment-repair/	2025-01-21T12:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1669833933.jpg

Zelensky&apos;s appearance follows his attendance at the January 2024 forum, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, paving the way for the global peace summit later that year.	https://kyivindependent.com/fairly-and-reliably-zelensky-reaffirms-commitment-to-end-war-in-2025/	2025-01-21T10:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
‘A team of attention-seekers’ — Ukrainian soldiers and politicians react to Trump's Inauguration speech	Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president on Jan. 20, giving a speech containing a bombastic series of announcements and executive orders, not to mention the declaration of two national emergencies. Setting out the goals of his second term, with billionaires Elon Musk, Amazon&apos;s Jeff Bezos, and Meta&apos;s Mark Zuckerberg at his side, Trump took aim at everything from transgender rights and electric cars to drug cartels and a mountain in Alaska. Yet he kept his comments on U.S. foreign policy relatively vague and general, and never once mentioned what is likely to be one of his administration&apos;s biggest challenges &#x2014; ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,&quot; Trump said without elaborating which events he was referring to. Trump declared open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas, saying it was time to &quot;drill baby, drill!&quot; Although he didn&#x2019;t speak about it in the speech, flooding global markets with U.S. oil and gas could potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil, the country&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine. A slightly stronger allusion to the war in Ukraine came when he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden for giving &quot;unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders&quot; at what he said was the expense of &quot;American borders, or, more importantly, its own people.&quot; Trump also said he would &quot;build the strongest military the world has ever seen,&quot; adding that success would be measured &quot;not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.&quot; &quot;My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That&#x2019;s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier,&quot; he added. Trump went on to highlight the ceasefire in Gaza which came into force the day before he was sworn in, but made no mention of any ceasefire or peace negotiations in relation to the war in Ukraine. The new president campaigned on a message of ending the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After his election, he has since admitted that bringing an end to the fighting in Ukraine will take much longer. In terms of apparent concrete foreign policy actions his administration will undertake, Trump only made reference to the Panama Canal which he&apos;d previously pledged to reassert U.S. control over. &quot;We&#x2019;re taking it back,&quot; Trump said, accusing Panama of mismanaging the critical trade route and allowing China to take de facto control of it. We asked six Ukrainians what they made of Trump&apos;s omission of Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion from his inauguration speech. lawmaker from the European Solidarity faction Trump is the president of the United States, not of Ukraine. It&#x2019;s understandable why his speech was focused on the U.S. I don&#x2019;t see a huge problem in the fact that he didn&#x2019;t mention Ukraine. Aryev said that it&apos;s more important for him that Trump is planning to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal and to increase oil production, which would reduce prices. It&apos;s a bigger blow for Russia than any statements.

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson / Pool / Getty Images)Yaroslav Yurchyshynlawmaker and head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s committee on freedom of speech We understand that Trump will prioritize internal affairs over external matters. Like any political consultant will tell you, talking about something traumatizing in an inauguration speech is not as effective as something motivating. We remember that Trump promised to finish the war in 24 hours, but even before the inauguration speech, he and his team understood, that for that goal, they needed much more time and that not hours, not days, not even months would be enough. And just after the inauguration speech, talking with the mass media, Trump said that he was ready to speak with Putin, but only after the beginning of the negotiation process. Yes, for Ukraine it would have been better to have been mentioned in the inauguration speech because it (would) show that Ukraine, the end of the Russia-Ukraine war, is among the priorities for Trump&apos;s new term. But we know that it&apos;s not. author and soldier in the Ukrainian army (Ending the war in) 24 hours is over, isn&#x2019;t it? Elon Musk kind of overwhelmed even Trump with the show (Musk made a controversial salute in a separate speech later in the day). I don&#x2019;t believe it matters what they say publicly, it&#x2019;s just a team of attention-seekers.

I&apos;m referring to his view on the U.S.&apos;s mission and role in ongoing or potential wars and conflicts. This is enough for me personally (to understand his perspective). Now, seeing how (Trump will approach ongoing wars), it is necessary to work with him on a practical level. medic in the 166th brigade, Kupiansk I can&#x2019;t say if things will be better for us (now Trump has been inaugurated) because Trump is definitely not a sympathizer of Ukraine. He loves himself and will make decisions and measures to keep face. He promised to stop the war in 24 hours. Well, in 24 hours, of course, he will not stop it. But in any case, he will lead such a policy to keep face, his status, his machismo, so to speak. And in this spectrum of his vision, Ukraine is unlikely to be a priority. lawmaker and chair of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee I&#x2019;m not disappointed because it was expected. In fact, he implied Ukraine when he was talking about the need to finish the wars in the world, and to prevent them from breaking out. Besides, Trump comes to power as, first and foremost most, the president who will focus on internal problems. The crux of the matter is whether he can come up with a realistic plan to stop Russian aggression. As of now, I don&#x2019;t see such a plan.

Zelensky says Ukraine working on arranging his meeting with Trump	Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump, Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;The teams have been working on a meeting; they are currently in the process,&quot; Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine&apos;s commitment to ending the war with Russia. Zelensky noted Trump&apos;s public pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot; Trump, sworn in on Jan. 20, has previously claimed he could swiftly broker peace, though he stressed the need to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first. On Jan. 20, Trump expressed doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. Zelensky also used his Davos address to urge Europe to strengthen its security framework and warn against reliance on the U.S. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; he said, highlighting Russia&apos;s growing military capacity and alliances with Iran and North Korea. He underscored the imbalance in military production, with Russia outpacing Europe in ammunition and equipment output despite its smaller economy. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; convenes nearly 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 addressed European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to pressure Russia into a just peace. Key speakers included Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics. Topics also ranged from geo-economic challenges to the evolving role of artificial intelligence in global cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-to-secure-zelensky-trump-meeting-president-announces/	2025-01-21T09:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Trump team may meet Ukrainian delegation in early February, MP says	Members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team may meet a Ukrainian delegation during Ukraine Week in Washington in early February, David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s faction in parliament, said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are now working to ensure that the relevant meetings are held at the inter-parliamentary level and other levels,&quot; he said, as cited by Interfax Ukraine. Following his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump reiterated his intent to pursue a peace deal in Ukraine but offered few specifics. Trump has instructed his aides to arrange a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after his inauguration, CNN reported on Jan. 19. The U.S. president told reporters on Jan. 20 that Putin is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal&quot; while acknowledging doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, was expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. However, he postponed his visit due to the U.S. Logan Act, which restricts unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi explained on Jan. 10. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 15 that Kyiv and Moscow must make concessions to achieve peace, signaling potential challenges in crafting a mutually acceptable agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-expected-to-meet-ukrainian-delegation-during-february-ukraine-week-arakhamia-says/	2025-01-21T08:44:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1263380211.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 10	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 10 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 13&#x2013;19, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Rada approves IMF-backed budget code reform for public investment The Ukrainian Parliament has passed draft law #12245, amending the budget code to streamline public investment management. The measure fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund benchmark. It establishes a centralized public investment fund to be overseen by the government&#x2019;s Strategic Investment Council, which currently mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers itself. This &#x201C;fund of funds&#x201D; will consolidate various expenditures, including the road fund, radioactive waste management, water resource development, decarbonization, and internal waterway projects. Ukrainian Parliament fails to advance reform to meet one of structural benchmarks The Committee on Law Enforcement reviewed four draft laws addressing the repeal of the &#x201C;Lozovyi amendments.&#x201D; However, it refrained from endorsing a specific proposal, recommending instead that parliament decide which draft to support. Despite the critical importance of these reforms, last week&#x2019;s parliamentary session failed to secure sufficient votes even to include the issue on the agenda.At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) supported the alternative draft law introduced by David Arakhamia, head of the Servant of the People faction. The bill proposes: Energoatom oversight board faces shortfall of international experts According to Forbes Ukraine, Energoatom&apos;s supervisory board is operating without a majority of its international experts, with contracts signed for only four members &#x2014; two from the Cabinet of Ministers and two international representatives. Journalists&#x2019; sources claim that Timothy Stone, a prominent figure in the U.K.&#x2019;s nuclear industry, declined to sign his contract, leaving a vacancy that the Cabinet must now fill through an open competition. According to Ukraine&apos;s Economy Ministry, on Jan. 17, the board convened for its first substantive meeting, electing former Lithuanian Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovich as chairman. Neverovich is expected to use his decisive vote in the event of a tie. The supervisory board&apos;s first major decision is anticipated to be the announcement of a competitive selection process for the position of Energoatom CEO. Ukrainian Parliament extends martial law and mobilization The Verkhovna Rada has voted to extend martial law and military mobilization, marking the 14th time such measures have been approved. The extension will remain in effect from Feb. 8 to May 9, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-10/	2025-01-21T07:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155584026.jpg
Europe must become stronger in face of Russian hostility, Zelensky says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, urging Europe to take charge of its own security amid escalating Russian threats. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. He called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. Despite having a smaller economy than Europe, Russia outpaces European nations in ammunition and military equipment production, a disparity Zelensky urged Europe to address collectively. Zelensky also emphasized the growing strategic ties between Russia, Iran, and North Korea, describing them as threats to Europe, the U.S., and global stability. &quot;These are their strategic priorities, and our priorities must meet this challenge &#x2014; in politics, defense, and economics. We can only counter such threats together,&quot; he said. Zelensky also said that Russia is evolving into a &quot;North Korea-like state,&quot; where human life holds no value, but nuclear weapons and hostility toward neighbors dominate its agenda. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to push Russia toward a just peace. High-profile speakers include Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics. Topics range from geo-economic uncertainty to the role of artificial intelligence in shaping global collaboration. Zelensky&apos;s appearance at the forum follows his attendance in January 2024, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, a precursor to the global peace summit in Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-must-step-up-as-global-player-in-face-of-russian-hostility-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T07:21:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on his Facebook channel that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/78-air-assault-regiment-deadly-accidents/	2025-01-21T07:05:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, von der Leyen says	The EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, while only 3% of its oil is imported from Russia, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. The share of Russian coal in Europe&#x2019;s imports also went from 50% before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion to zero by 2025, she said. &#x201C;Our gas imports from Russia went down by roughly 75% and now we import from Russia only 3% of our oil and no coal at all anymore,&quot; von der Leyen said. Europe began to wean itself off Russian energy commodities after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &quot;This (Russian) energy appeared cheap, but it exposed us to blackmail. So when (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s tanks rolled into Ukraine, Putin cut us off his gas supplies, and in return, we substantially reduced our dependency on Russian fossil fuels in record time,&quot; she added. Kyiv&apos;s decision not to prolong a gas transit deal with Gazprom past December 2024 ended the supply of Russian pipeline gas to the EU. European countries continue buying Russian liquified natural gas, purchasing record amounts in 2024. Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement in 2019 to transit 40 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually through Ukraine to buyers in the EU. Gazprom raked in an estimated $5&#x2013;$6.5 billion annually from the deal. Thousands of participants, including political leaders and CEOs, have gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also attending the forum and is expected to meet top political and business officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-has-reduced-russian-gas-imports-by-75-von-der-leyen-says/	2025-01-21T06:22:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194490301--1-.jpg
Kyiv court arrests former host of pro-Russian channels Max Nazarov	Max Nazarov, a former host of shuttered pro-Russian news channels, was taken into custody on suspicions of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21, citing a court ruling. Nazarov has been sent to custody for 60 days pending trial, with an alternative of bail of Hr 12 million ($285,000). Nazarov, whose real name is Nazar Diorditsa, previously worked as a news presenter at the Nash and NewsOne television channels, both of which were considered among the leading pro-Russian news outlets in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced charges against Nazarov after searches of his home on Jan. 18, saying that &quot;large-scale evidence&quot; and &quot;conclusions from independent experts&quot; point to the news host&apos;s &quot;anti-Ukrainian activities.&quot; After the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Nazarov regularly invited pro-Russian guests to his own YouTube channel show and used the discussions to justify Russian aggression and war crimes, the SBU said. Nazarov claimed on his Telegram channel that he bears no responsibility for the words of the guests he interviewed. Nash was owned by Yevheniy Muraiev, a wanted pro-Russian politician who fled the country after the full-scale invasion began and recently resurfaced in China. Ukraine sanctioned Nash in February 2022, leading to its closure. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. NewsOne was also formerly owned by Muraviev but later became part of the unofficial media empire of pro-Russian politician and former lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk, who lives in exile in Russia after being released from Ukrainian custody in a prisoner exchange in 2022. The news channel was banned in 2021 amid a broader crackdown on Medvedchuk&apos;s media operations, which were accused of promoting pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian narratives.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-court-arrests-former-host-of-pro-russian-channels-max-nazarov/	2025-01-21T05:31:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/e4df9e96f6019058f5aed403f88d5cea.jpg
‘It needs to end’ — State Secretary Rubio’s position on Russia’s war against Ukraine	Republican Senator Marco Rubio was confirmed as the new U.S. secretary of state on Jan. 20, becoming the first member of President Donald Trump&apos;s new cabinet. In a rare display of bipartisan consensus, Rubio was confirmed just hours after Trump was sworn in for a second term in the White House. As secretary of state, Rubio will oversee the implementation of Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, including that relating to Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; neither of which were directly referred to by the new president during his inauguration speech. Since Rubio was nominated for the position in early November, the signals coming from Trump and those around him about how the war in Ukraine might end have shifted dramatically, going from a swift end in &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; to a much more drawn out process that could take &quot;100 days.&quot; &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;It&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; Rubio said after being confirmed. Regardless of the approach the Trump administration takes, Rubio will be at the forefront of any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Rubio, 53, is a former Republican senator from Florida. The son of Cuban immigrants, he would be the first Latino U.S. secretary of state. Rubio ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 2016 but lost out to Trump after a heated, and at times bitter contest. Despite the rivalry at the time, Rubio went on to endorse Trump in 2016, albeit in not the most convincing of terms. &#x201C;I disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for president,&#x201D; he said. He endorsed Trump once again in 2024. Amid Rubio&#x2019;s confirmation, Trump revoked the former U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s last-minute decision to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in what became the first foreign policy decree by the new administration. &#x201C;Cuba belongs on the list,&#x201D; Rubio said a few days prior. The secretary of state job is Washington&#x2019;s top diplomatic position, and the person in this role is responsible for &quot;carrying out the president&apos;s foreign policy decisions and advising the president on issues of international concern,&quot; according to the National Museum of American Diplomacy. Rubio replaces Antony Blinken, who played a leading role in the U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. It was Blinken, along with his British counterpart David Lammy, who in September first received President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s detailed account of why Ukraine needs permission to strike targets deep inside Russia using Western missiles. Blinken has made numerous important announcements regarding Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance from the U.S., the provision of air defenses, and F-16 fighter jets. He has also made numerous trips to Kyiv during Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine. While on the job, Blinken was largely supportive of Ukraine and of providing Kyiv with what is needed to fight back against Russia&apos;s invasion. Rubio has publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. In terms of a resolution to the war, Rubio&apos;s statements and actions have been very much geared towards negotiation and an end to the fighting rather than giving Ukraine what it needs to push Russian forces from its territory. &quot;I think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia,&quot; Rubio said on Nov. 6. &quot;But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.&quot; In September, he insisted he was &quot;not on Russia&#x2019;s side&quot; but that the &quot;reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement.&quot; &quot;I would be comfortable with a deal that ends these hostilities and that I think is favorable to Ukraine, meaning that they have their own sovereignty, that they don&#x2019;t become a satellite state or a puppet state that is constantly held hostage by the Russians. I&#x2019;m not going to prejudge any agreement.&quot; Rubio has refrained from setting out any kind of timeline, and based on public statements, it&apos;s been left up to other members of the Trump administration to manage expectations. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without ever elaborating on how he planned to achieve it. After winning the presidential election in November, these expectations were significantly dampened by Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who said adjusted the timeline to within 100 days. Asked on Jan. 20 about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. It&apos;s too early to say what sort of peace deal Trump&apos;s new administration will pursue and be able to forge. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said on Jan. 20, without specifying what these concessions might be. &quot;Russia is the aggressor in this conflict, but this war needs to end. And ultimately, that&#x2019;s the complexity of foreign policy.&quot; Some reports in recent months have provided clues as to the shape of any peace process. The latest report came last month when the Financial Times, citing its sources close to Trump&apos;s team, reported that he planned to freeze the war. According to the paper, the new Vice President J.D. Vance, in September outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside the NATO military alliance. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create temporarily autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts which would later be fully reintegrated with the rest of Ukraine. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk agreements. In July, Politico reported that Trump was reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia. One of the sources told Politico that Trump &quot;would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have pushed back against the notion of any sort of ceasefire that would cement Russia&apos;s battlefield gains. &#x201C;When (Putin) gains strength, he might issue an ultimatum &#x2014; to recognize all occupied territories, to stay out of NATO, to forget about European integration,&#x201D; Zelensky said in June.&#x201C;And there will be many such conditions, depending on how strong (Putin) is at that moment. Therefore, a ceasefire is a trap,&#x201D; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-needs-to-end-state-secretary-marco-rubios-position-on-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2025-01-21T04:57:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
Chinese imports of Russian coal reportedly dropping over sanctions, price	China has been decreasing coal imports from Russia despite a steady growth in domestic demand, turning instead to Australian and Mongolian suppliers, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 21, citing Chinese customs data. This development signals another blow to the Russian coal industry, which is already facing multibillion-dollar losses and mass bankruptcies. Russia&#x2019;s share in Chinese coal imports shrank despite the latter&#x2019;s demand growing by 14% in 2024 compared to the previous year, The Moscow Times reported. Russia&#x2019;s coal exports to China were said to have dropped by almost 7%, with Mongolian and Australian coal export volumes growing 18% and 60%, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023. Warnings that Russia&#x2019;s coal industry was beginning to nosedive appeared in the second half of 2024, when AC TEK, a Russian state analytical center under the Energy Ministry, published a dire assessment. Western sanctions, insufficient transport infrastructure to the east, and Chinese tariffs levied on Russian coal are contributing to the industry&apos;s setback. Despite growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing, the Western sanctions have presented an increasingly serious obstacle to Russian-Chinese trade relations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-coal-imports-to-china/	2025-01-21T04:30:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1234072071.jpg
Russia’s Baltic Sea sabotage is no accident, it’s strategy	Intelligence officials in the U.S. and Europe have suggested that recent incidents damaging critical cables in the Baltic Sea were accidental, according to a Washington Post report. Western geostrategic self-deception has overly emphasized fears of escalation and cornering Russia. It would be na&#xEF;ve to assume that the repeated cutting of cables in the Baltic Sea, along with the recent leak, is purely accidental. Persistent incidents of &#x201C;poor seamanship&#x201D; in one of the world&#x2019;s most strategically significant maritime environments cannot be easily dismissed. Some within the Western foreign policy establishment may believe that this assessment signals de-escalation and patience toward Russia &#x2014; particularly with Donald Trump poised to take office. For them, the recently announced NATO operation in the Baltic is framed as mere maritime traffic control and accident prevention, requiring a more militarized presence for the sake of efficiency. The leak aligns with an unfortunate pattern of de-escalatory signaling to Russia. Yet others see the pattern of shadow fleet accidents as deliberate provocations with deeper geostrategic motivations, reflecting a tendency to escalate. A reasonable alternative to the &#x201C;accidents happen&#x201D; explanation is that the current and past incidents, which remain under investigation due to the inherent deniability, are the result of deliberate malice. Instead of downplaying these actions, a strong message of strategic resolve must be sent to Moscow. The cable-cutting occurred due to the self-evident, deliberate, and negligent actions of Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet. While tactical leaks to the media may ease tensions, they only do so for the intended audience. For Russia, however, these leaks signal Western discord, encouraging both recklessness and further sabotage. There are clear geopolitical reasons for giving Russia the benefit of the doubt when it comes to these sabotage incidents. The investigation is challenging and may not produce conclusive evidence. Authorities may want the issue to disappear to avoid unwanted attention and scrutiny. Moreover, the situation drains already limited military resources, and some countries are less motivated to escalate tensions in the Baltic Sea, particularly with elections on the horizon. However, putting too much emphasis on these concerns risks provoking further Russian aggression and weakening deterrence. As the Finns say, &#x201C;The Russians will keep pushing with their bayonet until it hits something hard.&#x201D; (L-R) Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb attend the Summit of Baltic Sea Allies at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, on Jan. 14, 2025. (Roni Rekomaa / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another Finnish saying, from their geopolitically pressured times, is that &#x201C;Moscow is not a district court.&#x201D; Russia respects the law only when it benefits them or when forced to do so, while Finland has always been committed to international law. Investigations are being conducted as thoroughly as possible, but conclusive attribution is difficult, as seen in numerous other suspected instances of Russian sabotage across Europe and North America. While the intent remains hard to establish, that shouldn&#x2019;t lead to granting Russia an implicit plea deal or allowing them to escape accountability. It&#x2019;s essential to see the forest for the trees. The repeated reckless actions by Russia should already be alarming enough to warrant countermeasures. The precautionary principle demands the establishment of deterrence. NATO has contributed to this by launching the Baltic Sentry operation. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte initiated the summit in Helsinki last week. Although not all NATO countries were invited, it was not just a Nordic-Baltic effort. More than half of Russia&#x2019;s energy exports pass through a critical corridor from St. Petersburg, through the narrow Gulf, and into the Danish Straits. If Russia&#x2019;s recklessness continues, this vital corridor, which allows for innocent passage, must be tightened. Legal measures to restrict this main artery include environmental, seaworthiness, and insurance inspections. The United Nations&apos; maritime convention, UNCLOS, also provides valuable alternatives. If Russia continues to abuse the line between war and peace, other legal frameworks, beyond UNCLOS, could become actionable. Russia views the Black, Baltic, and Arctic Seas as part of a unified geopolitical theater. The West should not engage in petty tactics like selective intelligence leaks. These are highly strategic waters, which Russia considers its imperial playground. Unfortunately, Chinese-registered ships have also been involved, as the Baltic Sea may serve as a rehearsal for the maritime blockade of Taiwan. Western reactions are carefully monitored. Ultimately, the Baltic Sea incidents are about testing Russia&#x2019;s defense thresholds. Leaks should not stem from minor disagreements or short-term considerations; when intelligence is leaked, it must convey a message of containment and deterrence.

Xi declares readiness to bring China-Russia ties to 'new height' in call with Putin	Chinese President Xi Jinping declared readiness to lead China-Russian relations to &quot;a new height&quot; together with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin&apos;s press service reported on Jan. 21 after a video call between the two leaders. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has nevertheless denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. In the call with Putin, Xi added that China is ready to stand with Russia to &quot;face external uncertainties based on maintaining the stability and stress resistance of China-Russia relations for the prosperity of the two countries, international justice, and equality.&quot; The Chinese president stressed that bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Moscow is gradually expanding and that joint trade is trending upward. Putin, in turn, noted a 7% increase in trade between the two countries, which amounts to more than $220 billion. The Russian president also called China Russia&apos;s leading trading partner. &quot;China is the largest consumer of Russian energy resources. We hold the first place in terms of oil exports to China. Five years ago, together with you, we launched the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, and today Russia has taken the first place in natural gas supplies to China,&quot; Putin said. Since February 2022, Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and again in May 2024. Xi visited Russia in March 2023, where he was welcomed by his &quot;dear friend&quot; Putin. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, while NATO has named Beijing a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/xi-declares-readiness-to-bring-china-russia-relations-to-new-height-together-with-putin/	2025-01-21T03:32:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1730511481--1-.jpg

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Davos, Switzerland, to participate in the annual World Economic Forum, his spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, confirmed for Suspilne on Jan. 21. Zelensky&apos;s itinerary will include bilateral talks with leaders of Latin American and Asian countries and meetings with top business officials. Some 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and governments, are expected to attend this year&apos;s forum, taking place between Jan. 20 and 24.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-davos-for-world-economic-forum/	2025-01-21T03:14:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Ukraine's SBU detains chief military psychiatrist over suspected illicit enrichment	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission that determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-detains-chief-military-psychiatrist-over-suspected-illicit-enrichment/	2025-01-21T03:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_10-00-03.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire is 'top priority' for Trump, US Secretary of State Rubio says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20. Asked about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. Rubio became the first high-level cabinet member of the new Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, making him the new U.S. secretary of state. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said, without specifying what these concessions might be. The chief U.S. diplomat acknowledged that Russia &quot;is the aggressor&quot; but stressed that the war &quot;needs to end.&quot; Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Although Trump vowed during his campaign in 2024 to put an end to the conflict in 24 hours if elected, aides revised the timeframe to the first 100 days after he took office. The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed details on any specific plans to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. An initial proposal leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2013; freezing the war along its current front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2013; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ceasefire-is-top-priority-for-trump-us-secretary-of-state-rubio-says/	2025-01-21T01:59:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194097519.jpg
Ukraine attacks Russian oil depot, aviation plant, command post overnight, military says	Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-aviation-plant-military-confirms/	2025-01-21T01:35:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-56-23.jpg
Trump pauses US foreign development aid for 90 days, orders review	U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. foreign development assistance for 90 days and ordered reviews of aid programs to ensure they align with Washington&apos;s foreign policy, according to an executive order published by the White House on Jan. 20. Trump signed numerous decrees after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Ukraine tops the list of U.S. development assistance recipients, receiving over $17 billion in economic aid in 2023 as it faces Russian aggression, official data shows. It remains unclear what programs will be affected or what the immediate impact of the order will be for Ukraine. As the federal budget is set by the U.S. Congress, it also remains unclear what funding could be cut by the order. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. &quot;All department and agency heads with responsibility for United States foreign development assistance programs shall immediately pause new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such programs for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States foreign policy,&quot; the executive order reads. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Trump has previously hinted at a possible reduction of military support for Ukraine and vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-pauses-all-us-foreign-aid-for-90-days-pending-review/	2025-01-21T01:04:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 15 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured at least 15 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 21. Russia attacked Ukraine with four Iskander-M ballistic missiles overnight, the Air Force said. Moscow also launched 131 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 72 drones, while 59 other drones were lost in the airspace without causing further damage. Three people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. These included two railway workers, Ukrainian Railways said. Three people were also injured in Russian strikes in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. The casualties were reported in Kostiantynivka, Lyman, and Druzhkivske. Two police officers were injured during a Russian attack on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, six people were injured in strikes against Kherson and 38 other settlements, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 49-year-old man was wounded in a Russian attack on the Vasylivka district of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-injure-15/	2025-01-21T00:30:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-36-32.jpg
Ukrainian drones reportedly attack Russian aviation plant in Smolensk	A Ukrainian drone attack targeted the Smolensk Aviation Plant in western Russia overnight on Jan. 21, starting a fire at the facility, the independent news channel Astra reported. Russian authorities confirmed a drone attack against Smolensk Oblast but made no mention of the plant. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses intercepted 55 drones overnight, including 10 in Smolensk Oblast. &quot;Fallen drone debris caused fires on the ground and on the roofs. Windows of residential buildings were also damaged,&quot; Governor Vasily Anokhin said on his Telegram channel. The governor also warned against alleged &quot;fake information and videos&quot; appearing on social media regarding the drone attack. At least two high-rise residential buildings were damaged as a result of the attack, the Russian Telegram channel Shot claimed. No casualties were reported. The Ukrainian military did not comment on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The same night, an oil depot in the village of Lisky in Voronezh Oblast caught fire due to fallen drone debris, Governor Alexander Gusev said. Ukrainian drones previously attacked the facility on Jan. 16.

US Senate confirms Marco Rubio as new secretary of state	The U.S. Senate confirmed Marco Rubio as the next secretary of state by a rare bipartisan consensus on Jan. 20, making him the first confirmed high-level member of the new Trump administration. Rubio will oversee the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, which is expected to entail a quick push to end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Trump has sent mixed signals about his approach to ending the conflict. Rubio recently said that both Russia and Ukraine would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal, possibly indicating an agreement that would allow Moscow to hold on to at least some of the occupied territories. Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Rubio replaced Antony Blinken, who, in the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, has played a leading role in U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-senate-confirms-marco-rubio-as-next-us-secretary-of-state/	2025-01-20T23:24:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Putin is 'destroying Russia by not making a deal' to end war, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-destroying-russia-by-not-making-a-deal-trump-says/	2025-01-20T22:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194451398.jpg

German FM urges Scholz to act and support aid to Ukraine amid election campaign	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has urged Chancellor Olaf Scholz to avoid politicizing aid to Ukraine during Germany&apos;s election campaign, n-tv reported on Jan. 20. Baerbock made the comments in Berlin, speaking alongside Lithuania&#x2019;s foreign minister. &#x201C;Times are too difficult now, Germany has too much responsibility for us all to indulge in pre-election rhetoric in the coming weeks,&#x201D; she said. Baerbock emphasized that Germany has pledged to support Ukraine and its Eastern European partners for as long as necessary. &quot;This is a crucial issue for trust in Europe, whether we are able to act in the interests of the security of all of us, our European security,&#x201D; she noted. Her remarks come amid reports of a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-urges-scholz-to-act-and-support-aid-to-ukraine-amid-election-campaign/	2025-01-20T22:04:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Erdogan intends to discuss ending Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that there was an urgent need for a &#x201C;just and lasting peace&#x201D; in Ukraine, at a press conference on Jan. 20. He made this statement after meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. &#x201C;A just and lasting peace must be achieved in Ukraine as soon as possible&#x2026;before the consequences of the war in our neighboring geography deepen even further,&#x201D; Erdogan said. He reaffirmed Turkey&apos;s ongoing commitment to this goal and noted his plans to discuss the matter with newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump. Slovak Prime Minister Fico acknowledged his country&#x2019;s limited influence in the outcome of the war, and noted that if the new U.S. administration can quickly end the war, it should be fully supported. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s take off our rose-colored glasses,&#x201D; Fico said, saying that there was a low likelihood of Russia withdrawing from occupied territories in Ukraine. The two leaders also signed agreements elevating Turkish-Slovak relations to a strategic partnership and expanding cooperation in military, cultural, and defense industries. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-intends-to-discuss-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine-with-trump/	2025-01-20T19:48:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1410425074.jpg
Macron warns of prolonged Ukraine war, urges stronger European defense strategy	French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned on Jan. 20 that Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is far from over, as Donald Trump, who vowed to quickly end the conflict, assumed office again. &quot;Let us not delude ourselves,&quot; Macron said earlier during his New Year&#x2019;s address to the French armed forces, according to AFP. &quot;This conflict will not end tomorrow or the day after,&quot; he added, with the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s invasion approaching next month. Trump has previously pledged to end the war &quot;in 24 hours&quot; without detailing his plan and later extended the timeline to several months. Speaking in Cesson-S&#xE9;vign&#xE9; in northwestern France, Macron emphasized the importance of strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s position. &quot;It is essential to provide Ukraine with the means to endure and to negotiate from a position of strength in the future,&quot; he said. He also stressed the need to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security and prevent a resurgence of war on its territory. Macron renewed his call for Europe to take greater responsibility for its defense, a point he has often raised. &quot;There can be no peace and security in Europe without Europeans,&quot; he said, referencing the war in Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s role in future negotiations. Trump&#x2019;s questioning of NATO commitments and his remarks about reducing support for Ukraine have sparked fresh urgency among European nations to reassess their defense capabilities. In 2023, France approved a record 413-billion-euro ($450 billion) military budget for 2024-2030, marking its most significant defense spending boost in decades. Macron also directed the government and armed forces to submit plans by May to mobilize more young volunteers to support the military. This appears to acknowledge the end of his long-championed universal national service project. &quot;In order to build up this reserve, the Defense and Citizenship Day will be revamped,&quot; he added, without elaborating. Currently, France requires all citizens to participate in a one-day &quot;Defense and Citizenship&quot; program at age 18, which introduces the country&#x2019;s military forces and includes a French language test. Macron called for better efforts to identify willing volunteers. During his 2017 presidential campaign, Macron proposed a month-long mandatory national service, aiming to expose young people to military life. The army&#x2019;s lukewarm response led to the government pivoting toward a civic service initiative instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-warns-of-prolonged-ukraine-war-urges-stronger-european-defense-strategy/	2025-01-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1522719294.jpg
EU plans to eliminate Russian fossil fuels, aims to end gas imports	The European Commission is developing a strategy to eliminate Russian fossil fuels from the European Union&apos;s energy market. However, gas deliveries from Russia to Europe persist despite the EU&apos;s efforts, and Brussels is determined to halt this, Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the EU&#x2019;s spokesperson for energy and housing, said. Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Jan. 20, Itkonen noted that work on a comprehensive roadmap to fully phase out Russian fossil fuels is ongoing. &quot;This initiative was announced as a priority for the Energy Commission to deliver within its first 100 days, so we still have a little time before the deadline,&quot; she said, according to Interfax news agency. Itkonen highlighted that the EU has already made substantial progress in reducing its dependence on Russian energy. &quot;We have significantly reduced imports of Russian gas, eliminated all coal imports from Russia, and cut most oil imports,&quot; she explained. Despite these achievements, Russian gas continues to be present on the EU market, which remains a concern. &quot;This is an issue we aim to address in the roadmap that will be unveiled in the coming weeks,&quot; Itkonen added.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-to-eliminate-russian-fossil-fuels-aims-to-end-gas-imports/	2025-01-20T13:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1013825882.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Key developments on Jan. 20: Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half amid the long-term impacts of Ukrainian strikes on Russian military targets, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said when asked what the impact of Ukrainian strikes has been on Russia&apos;s military supply-chain. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrskyi said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian ammunition depots in an attempt to stall Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Fighting has intensified in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv and Moscow try to gain an upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations following the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately, mobilization does not cover demand from the front line, Syrskyi said. President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. They are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. The prisoner of war (POW) in the newly released footage said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their position for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-following-ukrainian-strikes-commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained/	2025-01-20T12:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/2023-04-10-09.52.06.jpg
China’s support for Russia falls short in replacing Western materials, media reports	China has emerged as Russia&apos;s largest supplier of goods, but Chinese imports have failed to fully replace Western equipment and raw materials lost due to sanctions, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 20, citing data from the Gaidar Institute. The trade between the two countries is hindered by payment difficulties as the West intensifies sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese imports have partially compensated for Russian losses in key sectors. Medical and optical equipment imports rose by $1.3 billion annually compared to 2021, covering only 60% of pre-sanction European shipments. Plastics and polymers imports increased by $1.6 billion, replacing just 40% of EU supply. In mechanical equipment, Chinese imports covered 60% of losses, while electrical equipment saw less than 25% replacement. Chinese exports fell short in several categories. Aircraft shipments from Europe dropped by $3.1 billion annually, while Chinese exports amounted to only $201 million, just 7% of the shortfall. For pharmaceutical production, China supplied $108 million annually, far below the EU&apos;s pre-war level of $9.3 billion. Despite an initial surge in trade, growth has stagnated. After increasing by 30% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, mutual trade turnover grew by just 1.9% in 2024, reaching $244.8 billion. Chinese exports to Russia in yuan grew by only 5%, compared to 53% the previous year, while imports from Russia rose by 1%. Russian crude oil exports to China hit a record high in 2024, growing by 1% compared to 2023, according to Reuters. Broader trade figures highlight the limitations of Russia&apos;s pivot to China in offsetting the impact of Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-support-for-russia-falls-short-in-replacing-western-materials-media-reports/	2025-01-20T11:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Arms procurement head should keep post, supervisory board says	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency advised the Defense Minister to extend its director&#x2019;s work in a statement posted on Facebook on Jan. 20. &#x201C;The Supervisory Board submitted to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov a recommendation to extend the contract of the current director of the Defense Procurement Agency, Maryna Bezrukova, for one year,&#x201D; the statement read. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov planned to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency but changed his mind after a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards should be established. Bezrukova, a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, was appointed to head the DPA. &#x201C;This decision is based on an assessment of her performance and the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime,&#x201D; the supervisory board statement read. In a separate move, the supervisory board also announced initiating an independent audit by the International Board of Auditors of NATO (IBAN), the results of which will form a &#x201C;center of excellence for Ukraine&apos;s military procurement,&#x201D; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/arms-procurement-head-should-keep-post-supervisory-board-says/	2025-01-20T11:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01273.jpg
False story' — Denmark denies Russian claims of F-16 instructor killed in Kryvyi Rih strike	The Danish Defense Ministry on Jan. 19 denied Russian claims of the death of a Danish F-16 instructor in a missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17. &quot;This is a false story being spread by the Russian media &#x2014; probably with the aim of discrediting Denmark,&quot; Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. The Russian strike killed four people and injured 14 others, with damage reported to high-rise buildings, houses, vehicles, and an educational institution. Russian state news agency TASS alleged on Jan. 18 that a Danish F-16 instructor was killed during the attack, citing unnamed sources in Russia&apos;s security services. Denmark&apos;s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as false, emphasizing that no Danish military personnel have died in Ukraine. Poulsen condemned the disinformation, citing it as part of broader influence campaigns amid a serious security situation. Denmark, along with the Netherlands, has provided Ukraine with U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, which have been used in air defense operations to counter Russian missile strikes on cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/false-story-denmark-denies-russian-claims-of-f-16-instructor-killed-in-kryvyi-rih-strike/	2025-01-20T10:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996068.jpg
Massive Russian hack on government database shows cracks in Ukraine's digitalization drive	At the start of December, Ukrainians suddenly found themselves unable to sell cars, file legal claims, or register marriages through Ukraine&#x2019;s recently digitized government registries. Cybersecurity specialist and frequent coordinator of Ukrainian hackers, Karla Wagner, noticed when she went to register an NGO through the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. &#x201C;I was getting inconsistent results from the Justice Ministry website; I was able to submit the document, but I was not able to digitally sign it. And at first, I was annoyed because I&apos;m thinking, yeah, this is a crappy system,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;I was getting different results every time, from timeouts to errors to &#x2018;something didn&apos;t seem to work right, please try again later.&#x2019;&#x201D; The Justice Ministry on Dec. 19 formally announced that a Russian hack had taken a laundry list of critical government databases that had been put under the Justice Ministry offline. The databases contain sensitive information from property ownership to biometric data to tax records. Relevant Ukrainian offices quickly called it an act of war from Russia. &#x201C;The information space is one of the key directions of the enemy&#x2019;s attacks,&#x201D; wrote the State Communications Service, the national cybersecurity agency, in a statement provided to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russian hackers, who have become full-fledged participants in this war, are constantly getting better, improving their toolkits, tactics and strategy of operations.&#x201D; The statement contained no information on the technical details as to how the systems were compromised. XakNet, a hacking group previously tied to Russian intelligence, took credit for the attack, posting on Telegram data they claim to have hacked from the Ukrainian civil registry. The hackers claimed to have deleted at least some of the registry data. The Justice Ministry has since announced that all its state registries were ready to operate but that access to some registers was still limited, as their data still needs to be updated. Access to government services through the Diia app would be available in the near future, the ministry said on Jan. 20. The hack posed a major informational threat, highlighting how vulnerable government and Ukrainians&#x2019; personal data is to cyber attacks. In pushing to digitize its services quickly, the government also may have taken shortcuts that opened the door to digital onslaughts. Attacks of these kinds also erode public trust in the government, experts say. The core problem, as Wagner diagnoses, was the pace at which Ukraine rewired systems ranging from passports to tax payments into a single digital portal, all under the auspices of the Justice Ministry, in order to show positive results to foreign observers. &#x201C;It was very, very, very, very, very fast progress,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;And any IT project that has the heat on to make fast progress will cut corners where needed and save resources where needed with the best of intentions, which is meeting the deadlines and satisfying the requirements. (That) created not only a long string of vulnerabilities but also over-centralization in tech admin infrastructure.&#x201D; A woman uses her laptop as she takes shelter in a metro station during an air strike alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Mykyta Knysh, who formerly worked in cybersecurity for Ukraine&#x2019;s security services, the SBU, and currently runs the hacking collective &#x201C;HackYourMama,&#x201D; says the agencies involved should have known better. &#x201C;I understand that the Justice Ministry doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to have this kind of expertise, but the State Office of Security and Communications, the Digital Transformation Ministry, the SBU &#x2014; they should have that expertise,&#x201D; says Knysh. Hardly the most eye-catching of Russia&#x2019;s military operations against Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, the attack nonetheless presents a serious threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s security. &#x201C;If the Russians occupy more territory they can use that information, maybe to threaten or blackmail or defraud people who fall under them,&#x201D; says Knysh. Knysh hails from Kupiansk, a town in eastern Kharkiv Oblast that currently lies within five miles of Russian positions. The registries attacked included information like individuals&#x2019; addresses and assets, as well as familial relationships. It is not yet known whether the hackers involved have actually re-written the information for certain civilians. Knysh fears the hackers may have forged digital identities to grant Russian agents access to the front. The hack &#x201C;provides opportunities for Russian intelligence to obtain additional information about Ukrainian military and civilian government employees, and identify vulnerable or otherwise suitable people in Ukraine who can be recruited or coerced into conducting espionage activities and sabotage,&#x201D; analysts at cybersecurity firm Flashpoint wrote in a comments to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;However, more likely uses of such information include conducting future cyberattacks on other organizations in Ukraine using the information from public registries for reconnaissance, identity theft, social engineering, doxxing, harassment, and crafting convincing phishing emails,&#x201D; Flashpoint wrote. A Ukrainian soldier works with a computer next to a shelter in his fighting position in the direction of Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, Nov. 18, 2023. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Oleh Burba, who works as a component leader for EU4DigitalUA and coordinates registry integration says that while anything is theoretically possible if Russians have the access, there is currently no confirmed information they have changed anything in the registries. Though any such impacts have yet to materialize, the attack has already proved a major inconvenience to civil society, which Wagner sees as the biggest issue. &#x201C;You attack the Justice Ministry and the day-to-day business of government cannot go on,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Okay, nobody&apos;s going to die if I can&apos;t register my NGO. But it erodes confidence in the Ukrainian government.&#x201D; For Russia, Wagner considers it an extension of a propaganda war, similar to bombardments of Ukrainian national monuments. &#x201C;You don&apos;t need to hit strategic targets in a country. All you have to do is make it appear to be ungovernable.&#x201D; XakNet hackers also claimed to have destroyed backup data in servers in Poland. In its message the hacker group mocks Ukraine&#x2019;s government, saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very telling to store government data on foreign storage &#x2014; that&#x2019;s what independence Ukrainian-style looks like, apparently.&#x201D; The systems affected were under the umbrella of massive digitalization of government services that has taken place under the administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky, particularly his Digital Transformation Minister Mikhailo Fedorov. This digitalization has been enormously popular, largely seen as reducing opportunities for low-level corruption among a patchwork of regional agencies ruled by unscrupulous bureaucrats. But cybersecurity experts question the wisdom of the technical centralization of these systems within one office, with Knysh jokingly dubbing Fedorov&#x2019;s agency the &#x201C;Digital Degradation Ministry.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the beginning of the full-scale invasion we realized that Ukraine&apos;s digital infrastructure was overly centralized, according to the old Soviet model,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Centralization and single points of failure are a well-known anti-pattern. And it&apos;s highly vulnerable.&#x201D; &#x201C;My personal opinion was that (the hack) was through this system, &#x2018;Trembita,&#x2019;&#x201C; says Knysh. Trembita is a core data management system that provides the backend for government systems, specifically Diia, an app that has digitized government services like passports and tax paying. Knysh helped organize a hack on Russia&#x2019;s government services portal last year that among other impacts, immobilized digital voting. Independent hackers have been warning government agencies about the centralization of everyone&#x2019;s information under Diia since 2021. Trembita manages the digital communication between different registries. &#x201C;Trembita is a trip by rail,&#x201D; wrote Burba in an op-ed for Economic Pravda defending the system in May, describing the registries as cities, their digital links as railroads, and individual identifying codes as tickets. A mobile phone displays an error message for a marriage online on the &apos;Diia&apos; mobile app in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sept. 10, 2024. (Viktor Fridshon / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)&#x201C;Trembita specifically in this situation was not damaged or broken, it functioned just as it should have functioned and protected the information exchange between these registries,&#x201D; Burba told the Kyiv Independent. Knysh is especially concerned that authorities provided no details on the hack, citing &#x201C;a whole monopoly on what they are saying.&#x201D; Given that hackers re-use hacking techniques, he was concerned for other nations. It&#x2019;s not a problem limited to the Zelensky cyber team and Digital Transformation Ministry. Having worked for the Ukrainian SBU under former president Petro Poroshenko&apos;s administration, Knysh says &#x201C;Poroshenko was almost just the same,&#x201D; and acknowledged the need for a stronger digitized and federalized system of managing data. &#x201C;Before Trembita, there was total chaos,&#x201D; says Knysh. &#x201C;But then they said &#x2018;you will have a government of smartphones&#x2019; and now we have a government of smartphones open to the SBU and HUR,&#x201D; he continued, referencing Ukrainian intelligence agencies.

Trump sworn in as 47th US president	Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Vice President J.D. Vance took the oath of office alongside the president. Trump assumes office as the war in Ukraine enters its third year. While Trump initially vowed to end the war within 24 hours, his team later revised the timeline to 100 days, citing the intricate challenges of resolving the conflict. Ukraine remains cautious about the incoming administration, as Trump&apos;s past remarks on NATO and his perceived sympathies toward Russian President Vladimir Putin raise concerns about potential compromises unfavorable to Kyiv. During his first meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&apos;s desire for a ceasefire but avoided discussing specifics. Trump has pledged to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; and has tasked his aides with organizing a call. According to CNN, discussions for a face-to-face meeting are ongoing. Since his election victory on Nov. 5, Trump and his administration have sent mixed signals about their approach to peace. Trump&apos;s national security picks illustrate a range of perspectives on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, nominated for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and faced criticism for echoing Russian narratives. Michael Waltz, the likely national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state nominee, are considered hawkish on Russia. Defense Secretary nominee Peter Hegseth, an isolationist, walked back earlier calls to scale back U.S. involvement in NATO during confirmation hearings, emphasizing the alliance&apos;s importance. Special envoy nominee for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg has co-authored a draft peace plan involving a frozen front line, a delay in Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, and European peacekeepers in Ukraine. The plan also reportedly proposes continued U.S. military aid and security guarantees for Kyiv, though it partially lifts sanctions on Russia. Kellogg insists the proposals aim to &quot;save Ukraine and their sovereignty,&quot; not to appease Russia. Moscow has dismissed Trump&apos;s signals as &quot;unformed&quot; and reiterated demands for Ukraine&apos;s territorial concessions and NATO exclusion. Putin has expressed willingness for dialogue, though he maintains his insistence on Russia&apos;s terms, including complete control of four Ukrainian regions. Trump has urged European leaders to take a more active role in deterring Russian aggression, including deploying peacekeepers and pressuring China to influence Russia through trade measures. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-sworn-in-as-47th-us-president/	2025-01-20T09:02:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362623.jpg
Lithuania sends drones, thermal imagers, loaders in new Ukraine aid package, Defense Ministry says	Ukraine received a new military aid package from Lithuania, including domestically-produced drones, thermal imagers, and five-ton telescopic loaders, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 20. &quot;Keeping Ukraine safe means taking care of our security. We have as much time as Ukraine has,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said. The country has also removed bureaucratic barriers to expedite the delivery of support to Ukraine. Vilnius has committed to prioritizing air defense systems, ammunition, drones, and anti-drone weapons in its 2025 aid packages, along with funding Ukraine&apos;s defense industry to boost local production. Kyiv plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production in 2025, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13. Lithuania has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine, pledging 0.25% of its GDP annually in military assistance. By October 2024, Vilnius had provided &#x20AC;840 million ($860 million) in aid, making it one of the top donors relative to GDP, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-sends-drones-thermal-imagers-loaders-in-new-ukraine-aid-defense-ministry-says/	2025-01-20T08:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1-4.webp
Russia's primitive glide bombs are still outmatching Ukraine's air defenses, killing more civilians	When a glide bomb exploded at an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, the 13 dead, and 122 injured marked the highest number of civilian casualties in a Russian attack on Ukraine in almost two years. Despite being one of the most primitive and numerous weapons in the Russian Air Force&apos;s arsenal, Ukraine&apos;s sophisticated, Western-supplied air defense systems are still ill-equipped to deal with the threat they pose. Compounding the problem, Russia continues to modify and adapt its glide bombs, increasing their range and destructive power, meaning more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are coming under threat. &quot;Aerial glide bombs have become one of the greatest threats to civilians in cities along the frontline,&quot; Danielle Bell, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Jan. 9. &quot;They are also one of the main reasons why the number of killed and injured in 2024 increased by 30 per cent compared with 2023.&quot; According to HRMMU figures, Russian glide bombs killed 360 Ukrainian civilians in 2024, and injured 1,861, a threefold increase in fatalities, and a sixfold increase in injuries compared to 2023. A glide bomb is a standard air-dropped bomb modified with wings and often a satellite navigation system, so they can be launched from a distance rather than directly over a target. Their origins date back as far as World War II, and have been used in conflicts since including Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Russian glide bombs are often Soviet-era FAB weapons upgraded with a Unified Gliding and Correction Module (UMPK), which allows it to glide to its target, but Moscow is also developing newer, dedicated versions.

(Russian Defense Ministry / Handout / Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian forces employ various sizes of glide bombs weighing 250, 500, and 1,000 kilograms (kg). The most powerful in Russia&apos;s arsenal is the FAB-3000, a 3,000-kilogram high-explosive bomb, which the Russian Defense Ministry claimed in March had gone into mass production. In July, it released footage of what it said was a FAB-3000 being dropped on Ukrainian territory for the first time, saying it has a combat power that &quot;cannot be ignored.&quot; Crucially, converting an unguided &quot;dumb bomb&quot; into a glide bomb is cheap. Each conversion costs around $20,000, far less than cruise and ballistic missiles that cost millions of dollars to produce. Russian forces began using glide bombs against Ukraine in early 2023 to compensate for the lack of precision-guided munitions, dropping hundreds a week, according to figures from Kyiv.

(Ivan Samoilov / Gwara Media / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Glide bombs are most effective against static targets, including &#x200B;&#x200B;bridges, command posts, bunkers, and weapons depots, and Russia has used them to great effect on the front lines as they advance slowly in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Despite many problems and shortfalls, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) is learning, and adapting its tactics in a constantly changing combat environment,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent. But Moscow has also used them to devastating effect against Ukrainian population centers, with Sumy, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts particularly hard hit. Glide bombs are highly-destructive, and incredibly difficult to shoot down. &quot;Glide bombs, unlike missiles, do not have a propulsion system, so they don&apos;t generate much heat and are therefore largely immune to interception by infrared homing missiles, like the AIM-9 Sidewinder, or the FIM-92 Stinger,&quot; Jacob Parakilas, research leader in RAND Europe&apos;s Defence, Security and Justice Research Group, told the Kyiv Independent. Parakilas said anti-aircraft guns like the German-made Gepard are more effective at shooting down glide bombs, but their short range makes them ineffective at policing the hundreds of miles of front line in Ukraine. &quot;The limited range of those systems means that they would have to be right on top of the target, and able to identify and open fire on it in a very short time window &#x2014; which is difficult even if sufficient numbers of those systems were available,&quot; he said. The range of the weapons also allows the Russian fighter jets that launch them to stay out of range of Ukraine&apos;s advanced air defense systems such as the U.S.-supplied Patriot. Ukraine did have a string of successes early last year, downing several Russian military planes of the types used to launch glide bombs. But positioning air defense assets so close to the front lines is risky, and after Russian forces allegedly managed to destroy two Patriot launchers in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine appears to have abandoned the tactic. &quot;Russia can exploit gaps in Ukraine&apos;s air defense, which is stretched thin and needs to cover a very large territory,&quot; Borsari said. Russia is constantly upgrading UMPK kits to increase the range and accuracy of its glide bombs. When interviewed by the Kyiv Independent in May of last year, experts said the range of glide bombs being used by Russia was &quot;generally considered not to exceed 50-60 kilometers.&quot; But in the months since, a number of modifications mean newer models can now fly up to 90 kilometers, placing many more Ukrainian civilians within their deadly reach.

(Yevhen Titov / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Borsari said that particular attention should be paid to the relatively new and more advanced UMPB-D-30SN system which, in addition to wings and a guidance system, also has a small jet-propulsion engine which extends the glide bomb&apos;s range. Then there are the improvements to the electronic systems. Russian forces have been improving the navigation systems that guide the UMPK via satellite, allowing it to be more accurate. They are also often equipped with Kometa antennas which stabilize satellite communications signals, and are particularly resistant to electronic warfare countermeasures. In lieu of an effective means of targeting glide bombs in flight, experts say Ukraine&apos;s best options are to target both the planes that drop them, as well as the production and storage facilities they pass through before they&apos;re used. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s allies should prioritize speeding up the pipeline for delivering, supporting, and providing training for the crews of F-16s, which can target and push back the Russian jets dropping glide bombs,&quot; Parakilas said. The first General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons received by Ukraine fly on the Day of Ukrainian Air Force in an unspecified location, Ukraine, on Aug. 4, 2024. (Vitalii Nosach / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;Adding other air defense fighters &#x2014; as France has promised to do with the Mirage 2000 and Sweden has considered with the Gripen &#x2014; would also help, although every new type of aircraft added increases the complexity of Ukraine&apos;s supporting infrastructure and supply chain,&quot; he added. Ukraine&apos;s long-running, long-range drone strike campaign has reportedly had successes targeting sites where Russia stores FAB bombs, most recently in a series of strikes last week. But their continued and widespread use suggests Ukraine can&apos;t currently destroy them at a rate quicker than Russia can produce them. &quot;In the long-term, another possibility is the use of directed-energy weapons, such as lasers, which are being developed and tested in various countries as a cost-effective countermeasure to aerial threats,&quot; Eken said. However, the widespread deployment of such weapons is far off, and in the meantime, more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are likely to come within range of Russia&apos;s ever-evolving glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-primitive-glide-bombs-are-still-outmatching-ukraines-air-defenses-killing-more-civilians-2/	2025-01-20T07:00:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192463415.jpg
Putin congratulates Trump amid inauguration, signals readiness for talks	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-trump-amid-inauguration-signals-readiness-for-talks/	2025-01-20T06:50:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
Commander of scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade detained, accused of failing to report desertions	The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained-accused-of-failing-to-report-desertions/	2025-01-20T06:11:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Trump sees peace in Ukraine as a deal but refuses to play his winning hand	The impending Donald Trump presidency has fueled market speculation that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached soon &#x2014; bolstered by Trump&#x2019;s campaign trail rhetoric promising to end the war within days of taking office, if not sooner. Ukrainian Eurobonds have been among the best-performing assets in emerging markets in recent months, notably alongside Lebanon, another &quot;war or peace&quot; play. However, achieving a durable peace deal between Ukraine and Russia may not be as simple as Trump has implied &#x2014; a realization that seems to have dawned on him. His initial promise of peace within days has now been extended to six months. General Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s designated Ukraine envoy, has also tempered expectations, expressing hope for a breakthrough within the first 100 days of the Trump administration &#x2014; a timeframe that is likely to slip further. Does Trump actually have a peace plan for Ukraine? It&#x2019;s doubtful. The shifting deadlines for progress reflect this uncertainty. Trump and Kellogg don&#x2019;t appear to have a deep understanding of Ukraine, Putin, or European security. Ukraine&#x2019;s fate doesn&#x2019;t seem to rank high among Trump&#x2019;s priorities, which focus instead on &quot;Making America Great Again.&quot; Campaign promises to pull financial support for Ukraine resonated with voters when framed as reallocating resources to neglected U.S. communities. However, even if U.S. support for Ukraine is cut, it&#x2019;s unlikely those funds will find their way to disadvantaged Rust Belt communities. For Trump, Ukraine is a problem for Europe. His recent comments about U.S. territorial ambitions &#x2014; regarding Canada, Greenland, and Panama &#x2014; suggest his intent to extract a quid pro quo from Russian President Vladimir Putin for signing off on Russian territorial gains in Ukraine. Trump may be signaling that if he accepts Russia&#x2019;s terms, he expects something in return, such as turning a blind eye to a U.S. claim on Greenland. This mindset underscores Trump&#x2019;s transactional approach, with Ukraine at risk of being sold out in the process. While Kellogg and Mike Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s pick for national security adviser, might attempt to articulate a coherent strategy, it&#x2019;s unclear if Trump is aligned with their efforts. Trump holds significant leverage over Putin, particularly regarding Ukraine. Russia needs a deal more than the U.S. does. A prolonged war risks economic collapse from sanctions, potential Yevgeny Prigozhin-style military mutinies, and rising social unrest. While Ukraine also faces challenges &#x2014; manpower shortages and donor fatigue &#x2014; these are manageable compared to the risks for Putin. For the U.S., the cost of supporting Ukraine, at roughly $100 billion over three years (40% from the U.S.), is a fraction of the defense budget. Much of this spending benefits the U.S. directly through payments for American arms, often older equipment being replaced by modern upgrades. Additionally, the war has prompted NATO allies and Ukraine to ramp up U.S. arms purchases, while Europe is expected to increase defense spending by over $250 billion annually. The longer the war continues, the more the U.S. benefits economically while Russia&#x2019;s capabilities are depleted &#x2014; all without risking U.S. troops.

(Charly Truballeau/AFP/Getty Images)A more effective negotiating strategy for Trump would be to pressure Putin by threatening increased support for Ukraine or imposing harsher sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s economy &#x2014; steps that would come at minimal cost to the U.S. Trump could signal support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership or approve the use of long-range missiles capable of striking deep into Russia. He holds all the leverage. Yet, instead of using this leverage, the Trump administration appears to be giving it away to Putin. Trump has signaled no NATO membership for Ukraine, no long-range missiles, a halt to financial aid for Ukraine, and potential sanctions relief for Russia. Meanwhile, figures like Kellogg and Waltz have floated proposals to freeze front lines, effectively allowing Russia to retain the territory it currently occupies. Despite holding all the aces, Trump seems to have handed the game to Putin. For Ukraine, security is paramount in any peace deal. The country can survive losing the territories currently occupied by Russia, but its economic prospects depend on security guarantees. These could come through NATO membership, bilateral security assurances, or robust Western military and financial support akin to the U.S.-Israel relationship. However, Trump&#x2019;s concessions &#x2014; rejecting NATO membership and dismissing bilateral guarantees &#x2014; have shifted the debate to limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive capabilities. Putin will exploit this to keep Ukraine vulnerable to future invasion, deterring investment and stalling reconstruction. The resulting insecurity would discourage millions of Ukrainian refugees from returning home, risking further emigration and domestic instability. Europe faces dire consequences if Ukraine collapses: waves of Ukrainian refugees, fueling far-right populism, and a bolstered Russian military-industrial complex. A resurgent Russia, emboldened by victory in Ukraine, might target the Baltics or Moldova next. Europe&#x2019;s security hinges on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself as the front line against Russian aggression. Trump may not grasp the stakes for Europe, but European leaders must. With the U.S. stepping back, Europe must wake up to its existential threat from Russia and take responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. A $150 billion annual price tag to support Ukraine is manageable for Europe&#x2019;s $25 trillion economy &#x2014; especially compared to the $250-$500 billion yearly increase in defense spending likely required if Ukraine falls. Unlocking the $330 billion in immobilized Russian central bank assets could provide Ukraine with significant financing. Additionally, Europe should appeal to Trump&#x2019;s economic priorities by framing support for Ukraine as a boon for U.S. jobs, branding it as the &quot;Trump Plan for the Defense of Europe&quot; or a modern Marshall Plan. Unfortunately, European leaders remain in denial, ignoring the risks of a Trump presidency and failing to connect the dots between Ukraine&#x2019;s security and their own. Ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s stability isn&#x2019;t just about protecting one country&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about safeguarding the future of Europe as a whole.

China imports record amount of Russian crude oil in 2024, Reuters reports	Imports of Russian crude oil to China reached a record high in 2024, rising by 1% compared to 2023, Reuters reported on Jan. 20. The Russian fossil fuel industry is the primary economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Despite sanctions and Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil production, China, the world&apos;s largest crude oil buyer, continues to import from Russia. According to China&apos;s General Administration of Customs, in 2024, 108.5 million metric tons were imported, including through pipelines and sea deliveries, equivalent to nearly 2.17 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, China has reduced supplies from Saudi Arabia by 9%. Saudi Arabia shipped 78.64 million tons, or about 1.57 million barrels per day, which is 1.72 million barrels per day less than in 2023. China has been reducing its imports from Saudi Arabia due to rising crude oil prices in the country and the growing share of oil from Russia and Iran at lower prices, according to Reuters. Yet, in the fourth quarter, Saudi Arabia&apos;s share of China&apos;s imports increased after Iran&apos;s supplies declined and prices of the OPEC oil cartel, which Russia is a member of, fell. China also imported 28% more than usual from Malaysia, the main transshipment center for sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela. In December, almost 295,000 tons were exported from Venezuela. This country&apos;s total volume of supplies in 2024 amounted to 1.5 million tons or 30,000 barrels per day. No oil imports from Iran were recorded for the whole of 2024. Total crude oil imports to China decreased by 1.9%. This is the first annual decline since the pandemic due to weak economic growth and lower demand for fuel, Reuters reported. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down their economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-imports-record-amount-of-russian-crude-oil-in-2024-reuters-says/	2025-01-20T05:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1209343725--1-.jpg
I didn't know who I'd be fighting' — North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine speaks in new footage	President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. Both soldiers were injured but survived. The prisoner of war (POW) said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw He joined the army at the age of 17 and served on conscript duty in a reconnaissance battalion and said his mother does not know where he is now. The POW said he did not know he was going to war or know who he would be fighting against. The full conversation conducted via a translator is as follows: Interrogator: Did you and other North Korean servicemen undergo training on the use of Russian weapons and military equipment? If so, where and when? POW/Translator: There were a few soldiers from North Korea who were trained to use heavy Russian equipment, but I personally did not undergo such training. Interrogator: Where did you serve? In which unit? POW: (I work) in a reconnaissance battalion. Interrogator: Does your mother know where you are? POW: No she doesn&apos;t. Interrogator: How many people were on the ship that transported you from North Korea to Russia? POW: Approximately over one hundred. Interrogator: What kind of ship was it? POW: I believe it was a Russian ferry, but not a military vessel &#x2014; just one for transporting cargo. Interrogator: Were only people on board or was there cargo as well? POW: It was only us. Interrogator: How many seats were in the train car you traveled in? POW: The same people who were on the ferry were also on the train &#x2014; there were no others, it was the same group. Interrogator: Were there beds in the carriage, how many? POW: There were six tables and beds. In total there were about 100 people. Interrogator: Tell us about the beginning of your service in the ranks of the North Korean armed forces. Specifically, when did you begin your military service? How did it happen and so on? Where did you serve? POW: Typically, after finishing school all men join the military. I also joined the army after finishing school and joined the reconnaissance division and stayed there for my entire service. Interrogator: How old were you when you started your service? POW: I was 17 years old. Interrogator: Are you serving under contract or conscription? POW: Not under contract, conscription. Interrogator: Do you voluntarily wish to give truthful testimony about the circumstances of your participation in hostilities against Ukraine? POW: First of all, as I&apos;ve already said, I didn&apos;t know before coming to Russia that I would be fighting here, in Russia and I didn&apos;t even know who we were fighting against. Interrogator: What do you know about the losses suffered by North Korean units during combat operations against the Armed Forces of Ukraine? In which battles, from what types of weapons, and how many casualties &#x2014; both wounded and irrecoverable? POW: There were a lot of casualties when I was there alone, starting from the battle on Jan. 3. Overall, it&apos;s hard to answer about such large-scale numbers. Interrogator: What did you know about the world outside of North Korea? POW: Not much. Interrogator: Did you know anything about South Korea? What did you know? POW: I only know that South Korea has fewer mountains than North Korea. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-releases-new-footage-of-interrogation-of-north-korean-soldier-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-20T04:18:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 5 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 20. Russian forces launched 141 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also struck Sumy Oblast with an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 93 drones in Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kherson, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Forty-seven drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day.

Russia launched nearly 550 drones, 60 missiles, over 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine in a week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched around 550 attack drones, nearly 60 missiles of various types, and more than 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine during the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 20. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Jan. 15, targeting Lviv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts. On Jan. 18, Russia attacked Kyiv with missiles, killing three people, and injuring three others. Over the week, the Ukrainian military shot down 33 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and 311 attack drones, according to Zelensky. Another 136 drones used in daily attacks on infrastructure &quot;did not reach their targets,&quot; the president added. &quot;I am very grateful to all our soldiers, military aviation, anti-aircraft gunners, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups. But the task remains unchanged &#x2014; continue strengthening our skies&apos; protection,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;More Patriot (air defenses) for Ukraine means more protection of life. More long-range capability for Ukraine means more guarantees that the Russian war will be stopped,&quot; he added. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. Ukraine is also reportedly working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-nearly-550-drones-60-missiles-over-660-aerial-bombs-against-ukraine-in-a-week-zelensky-says/	2025-01-20T02:50:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_6575.jpeg
Trump instructs aides to arrange call with Putin 'in coming days' after inauguration, CNN reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has tasked his aides with organizing a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the days after he is sworn in, CNN reported on Jan. 19, citing undisclosed sources. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments, but added no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. According to CNN, Trump is willing to discuss a face-to-face meeting with Putin by phone in the coming months to try to end the war in Ukraine. Trump&apos;s national security team began preparing a phone call with Putin several weeks ago, but it is unclear whether a date has been finalized, CNN added. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump &quot;sees things differently,&quot; which could mean that negotiations with Putin will differ from the approach taken by the Joe Biden administration, the media outlet reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. At the same time, Trump has not spoken to Putin in almost three years. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Kellogg said the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-instructs-aides-to-arrange-call-with-putin-in-coming-days-after-swearing-in-cnn-reports/	2025-01-20T01:41:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukraine's Svitolina defeats Russian opponent to reach Australian Open quarterfinals	Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina won her fourth match at the Australian Open on Jan. 20, defeating Russian neutral Veronika Kudermentova. Svitolina is the only Ukrainian to reach the quarterfinals in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to that, the 30-year-old defeated WTA No. 4 Jasmine Paolini, Romanian Sorana Cirstea, and American Caroline Dolehide. The match against Kudermetova lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes and ended with a score of 6-4, 6-1 in favor of the Ukrainian. Svitolina served five aces, and made three double faults. The Ukrainian tennis player also converted five out of nine break points. In the first set, Svitolina was down 1-4 but won the next five games and cruised to victory. &quot;I was just trying to fight, you know, for this fighting spirit,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean, the only thing I can do when things are not going your way, you just try to really put your head down and get back to work,&quot; she added. The Australian Open quarterfinals is a personal best for Svitolina. She also played at this stage in 2018 and 2019. &quot;That was a lifetime ago,&quot; Svitolina said during an interview after the match. &quot;You know, so many things happen &#x2014; having a daughter, Skai, then surgery as well. I&#x2019;m really pleased with the performance throughout this tournament,&quot; she added. Svitolina will face Madison Keys of the U.S., who defeated Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, in the quarterfinals.	https://kyivindependent.com/svitolina-reaches-australian-open-quarterfinals-for-3rd-time-beating-neutral-athlete-from-russian/	2025-01-20T01:06:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194508112.jpg
Ukraine Air Force specialists safe from transfer to infantry but mobilization issues remain, Syrskyi says	Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the armed forces. Fighting has intensified in Eastern Ukraine as Ukraine and Russia try to gain the upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately mobilization does not cover demand from the frontline, Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/mobilization-currently-does-not-meet-frontline-needs-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T22:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 820,430 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 820,430 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 20. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,821 tanks, 20,454 armored fighting vehicles, 34,488 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,074 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,049 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,768 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-820-430-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-19T22:10:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_1024.jpg
Fire, explosions reported near aviation plant, airfield in Russia's Tatarstan amid drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted in the city of Kazan in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan republic overnight on Jan. 20 amid a Ukrainian drone attack on the city, Russian Telegram channels reported. Videos posted to social media appear to show a large fire ablaze following a drone attack. Drones appear to be shown striking targets in the region. Rosaviatsiya, the country&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency, said that Kazan International Airport has suspended flights amid the attack. Begishevo airport, located east of the city in nearby Nizhnekamsk also had its flights suspended. Preliminary reports indicate that the explosions and fire originated in the Aviastroitelny district of the city, which is the home to an aviation college and several aviation factories. Russian Telegram media channels also reported that drones appear to be targeting Borisoglebskoye airfield which houses several fuel storage tanks. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reporting. Multiple explosions were reported in the city around 5:30 a.m. local time, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Kazan &#x2013; lying over 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of the Ukrainian border &#x2013; is located in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, which has previously been the target of Ukrainian drone strikes. Ukraine has regularly attempted to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supply-chain through the use of drone attack. The country&apos;s forces regularly target oil refineries that contribute to Russia&apos;s war effort. Overnight on Jan. 18, Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR).	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-flights-suspended-amid-drone-on-russias-tatarstan/	2025-01-19T19:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-19_23-01-15.jpg
150,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine in 2024, Syrskyi says	Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-in-2024-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T16:31:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/5-5.jpeg
Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half following the impact of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrsky said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T15:13:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg
Zelensky, first lady visit wounded soldiers, pledge to address accessibility issues	President Volodymyr Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska on Jan. 19 visited soldiers undergoing medical treatment after in Kyiv being wounded at the front and discussed issues related to mental health and disability access. The battlefield toll on Ukrainian soldiers has exacerbated mental health and accessibility challenges nationwide amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Zelensky met with soldiers that were injured while fighting in Pokrovsk, Kharkiv Oblast, and Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;We want to thank you for defending our country and our people, for your service across different fronts,&quot; the president said. &quot;Every front is important, and you served on the most challenging ones. You are our heroes, and we are deeply grateful to each of you.&quot; Wounded soldiers were presented with awards, including the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Zelensky and the first lady, alongside Veterans Affairs Minister Natalia Kalmykova, met with military medics and psychologists to discuss the steps the country has taken to combat the negative impact Russia&apos;s war has on mental well-being among Ukrainian soldiers. These include introducing operational combat stress control groups, developing psychological rehabilitation departments within hospitals, and increasing access to education in the field of psychology. Mental health support should be comprehensive and extend beyond injured soldiers, the first lady said. &quot;We need to ensure that support is comprehensive. For example, in hospitals, it should extend not only to wounded soldiers but also to their family members and the medical staff working in high-stress conditions,&quot; Zelenska said. Zelensky also highlighted the Movement Without Barriers project, an initiative piloting new wheelchair-accessible routes in 12 cities. The project is being implemented by the community and territorial development ministry as part of Zelenska&apos;s initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-first-lady-visit-wounded-soldiers-in-hospital/	2025-01-19T13:39:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zel.jpeg
Ukraine producing its own air defense systems, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. &quot;Back in Soviet times, we actually produced all the control systems for anti-aircraft systems. That is, we have the capacities and capabilities to create, and we are working on creating, our own domestic air defense complex,&quot; Syrskyi told TSN. Ukraine&apos;s homegrown system aims to match the U.S.-made Patriot air defenses, he said. Syrskyi said that the threat posed by Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, is strong motivation for Kyiv to produce its own anti-missile air defenses. Only a few air defense systems can repel the Oreshnik, Syrskyi said, and Ukraine does not yet possess these capabilities. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; he said. &quot;This encourages us to actively negotiate with our allies to get such a system. And, of course, this should encourage us to create a modern missile system that could be a deterrent against the use of such weapons by the Russians.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Western air defense systems are incapable of intercepting Oreshnik missiles, even going so far as to propose a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West that would involve launching the Oreshnik at Kyiv. &#xA0; The U.S. operates the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system has not been supplied to Ukraine and, therefore, has never been tested against the Oreshnik. Syrskyi said in the interview that work had already begun on developing Ukraine&apos;s own anti-missile system. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he said. &#xA0; Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The U.K. has agreed to finance production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Umerov announced on Jan. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-producing-its-own-air-defense-systems-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T12:16:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 20-Jan. 26. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The global spotlight will be fixed firmly on Washington D.C. next week as Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States on Jan. 20. This is perhaps the most anticipated event of the year, with allies and adversaries bracing for potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy and its impact on global power dynamics. On the same day, the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum will start in Davos, Switzerland, centered around the theme &#x201C;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.&#x201D; The forum will run from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24 and focus on adapting economies to anticipated geopolitical shifts and technological advances, including artificial intelligence. Additionally, European MEPs will gear up for the Jan. 20-23 plenary session at the European Parliament to address the ongoing repression in Belarus and vote on a resolution condemning Russia&#x2019;s disinformation and historical distortions used to justify its war against Ukraine. On Jan. 22, the Polish PM, Donald Tusk, will present the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union to the plenary of the European Parliament. The address is expected to focus on European security, emphasizing Polish strategic objectives during its tenure (Ukraine will be looking for indications of Poland&#x2019;s willingness to help fast-track its negotiation clusters and speeding up EU accession). On Jan. 22, Ukraine marks Unity Day, commemorating the 1919 unification treaty between the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic (the union lasted until 1921). This will be followed by a series of historical dates, culminating with the 3rd anniversary of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 and the war&#x2019;s entry into its 2nd decade on Feb. 27. The week will then be capped off by the Presidential &#x201C;election&#x201D; in Belarus on Jan. 26 with Alexander Lukashenko set for another five-year term. Due to the severe political repression in the country, major protests are unlikely.

Ukraine's General Staff launches investigation into 156th Brigade	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has directed the military to initiate an investigation into the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces announced on Jan. 19. The investigation comes on the heels of a state probe into the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Oleh Apostol will lead the investigation, the General Staff said in a social media post. &quot;The purpose of the work is to check the progress of the brigade&apos;s formation and provide comprehensive assistance in organizing and preparing for combat operations,&quot; the post read. Recent inspections of the 156th Brigade revealed &quot;a number of significant shortcomings,&quot; according to the military. Plans to address these problems include replacing the brigade&apos;s leadership, appointing a commander with practical combat and command experience, and transferring combat-tested officers and sergeants into the unit. Other necessary steps involve improving practical training for personnel and increasing training for drone pilots and electronic warfare operators. &quot;It should be noted that the mistakes that occurred during the formation and training of the 155th &apos;Anne of Kyiv&apos; Brigade have been taken into account, and measures are being taken to prevent them in the future,&quot; the General Staff said. The 156th Brigade is one of 14 new brigades formed by Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in recent months. The newly formed brigades have faced front-line challenges and accusations of mismanagement &#x2014;&#xA0;particularly the 155th, the French-trained brigade at the center of a mass desertion scandal. Ground Forces Chief Mykhailo Drapatyi said on Jan. 8 that &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; contributed to the problems with the 155th Brigade. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, deployed near the front-line hot spot Pokrovsk, suffered heavy losses and deserted in large numbers due to poor command and organization. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-general-staff-launches-investigation-into-156th-brigade/	2025-01-19T11:09:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193363924.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits 2 oil depots in Russia overnight; Zelensky sanctions top pro-Russian politicians	Key developments on Jan. 19: Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts overnight on Jan. 18, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR). The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&apos;s drone attacks on Russia, as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort. The drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) hit the oil depot in Tula Oblast at least 10 times in this attack, a HUR source claimed. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. Ukrainian soldiers also hit an oil depot in the Russian town of Lyudinovo in Kaluga Oblast overnight, causing a fire, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. Lyudinovo lies around 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. The oil depot is owned by Kaluganefteprodukt, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state-controlled oil company Rosneft, according to the statement. &quot;(This is) a logistics center that supplies units of the Russian armed forces directly involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian politicians and propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. Eighteen people were listed on the formal decree. Among them are prominent pro-Russian politicians Yuriy Boyko, Nestor Shufrych, and Yevhen Muraiev. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Shufrych was arrested last year on charges of subversive activities against Ukraine and financing Russia&apos;s National Guard in occupied Crimea. According to the investigation, Shufrych paid Russia&apos;s National Guard to guard his elite real estate in Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Muraiev, former leader of the now-banned pro-Russian Nashi party, was charged with treason in 2023. The Security Service noted that Muraiev used his media empire, including the Nash TV channel, to disseminate pro-Russian narratives. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warnedthat the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. Media reports have stated that Muraiev left Ukraine in 2022. Zelensky also noted that the country is working to deprive pro-Russian figures of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky strip the Hero of Ukraine award from Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&apos;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&apos;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-2-oil-depots-in-russia-overnight-zelensky-sanctions-top-pro-russian-politicians/	2025-01-19T09:55:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
As Trump prepares to take office, Kyiv awaits his team's next moves	As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20, Ukraine&apos;s fate hangs in the balance. While some potential details of Trump&apos;s future peace proposals have been leaked, the overall plan still remains unclear. Since the Nov. 5 presidential election, Trump and his team have sent mixed signals on whether their potential peace proposals will be favorable to Ukraine. Based on their public statements, Trump and his team have realized the complexity of the conflict and revised the timeline for achieving a peace deal. Previously, Trump talked about a 24-hour deadline, but now it has become a six-month timeframe. &quot;Over the past month and a half, they have realized that the contradictions between Ukraine and Russia are quite deep and complex,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This problem cannot be resolved quickly or with a simplistic approach. They are adjusting their approaches and deciding how to move forward.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that &quot;Trump wants an end to the war and he wants credit for achieving it.&quot; &quot;So we should expect plenty of drama and bold statements, perhaps backed up by bold actions,&quot; she added. &quot;But would those bold actions favor Russia or Ukraine? There are signs pointing both ways. Trump clearly admires (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and finds his statements persuasive. But Trump also wants to be seen as strong in his own right, so he might react badly to any suggestion that he is acting as Putin&apos;s pawn.&quot; President-elect Trump has nominated people with polar views on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump&apos;s nominee for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and had previously been accused of promoting Russian narratives. Peter Hegseth, Trump&apos;s pick for defense secretary, is an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to NATO. He backtracked his statements during confirmation hearings, saying that the U.S. won&apos;t leave the alliance and that &quot;we know who the good guy is&quot; in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Michael Waltz, who is expected to become Trump&apos;s national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, are seen as more pro-Ukrainian and hawkish on Russia than other nominees. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s nominee for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is also seen as more favorable to Kyiv. He has stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The Telegraph also reported on Nov. 7 that, under one of the peace plans being considered by Trump, he might call on British and other European troops to enforce a buffer zone that the president would attempt to establish in place of the current front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer (L) and French President Emmanuel Macron (R), at the Elysee palace for a working meeting in Paris, France, on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2024 (Benjamin Girette/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Rubio said on Jan. 15 that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;Any quick deal (even over six months) would likely end the fighting along the current line of control while ensuring that Ukraine has long-term protections and that Russia has financial/economic incentives to stop fighting,&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Beyond that, I&apos;m not sure what the Trump team plans.&quot; As the specific details of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, its timeframe has been shifting. Trump said on Jan. 7 that peace would be achieved within six months. Kellogg said that a concrete plan needs to be established within the administration&apos;s first 100 days. Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the longer six-month timeline is Trump&apos;s effort to weasel out of an unrealistic promise.&quot; Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, also said that &quot;the team has just realized that it will take more time and effort to reach a deal.&quot; &quot;The fact that (Trump) and his team have stepped back from insisting he will end the war in 24 hours to talking about a process that will take months is encouraging and in keeping with his and his team&apos;s practice of walking back some of his most flamboyant campaign promises to manage expectations among voters,&quot; Mathers said. The revised policy may also have had an impact on Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg. Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. However, Kellogg postponed his visit until after the inauguration due to U.S. restrictions on unauthorized negotiations by private citizens with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Jan. 10. &quot;Kellogg postponed his visit because they may have started to realize that the idea of ending the war in 24 hours, or even within six months, is too ambitious and complicated,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They are now more realistic and are slightly adjusting their strategy.&quot; Some statements made recently by Trump and his allies appear to point in the direction of a peace deal from a position of strength. &quot;I want to reach an agreement and the only way you&apos;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon Ukraine,&quot; Trump said in an interview with the Time magazine published on Dec. 12. Kellogg said on Jan. 8 that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 9, citing two European officials, that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would persist following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. &quot;The whole (Trump) team is obsessed with strength and looking strong, so they&apos;re recalibrating the Ukraine approach,&quot; one official said. The official added that Trump&apos;s camp is cautious about avoiding comparisons with President Joe Biden&apos;s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they do not want to see replicated in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky pictured in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, on March 31, 2023. (Photo: President&apos;s Office)Trump advisors are also developing a comprehensive strategy to impose sanctions on Russia to pressure it towards a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. &quot;I don&apos;t think Trump wants to appear weak relative to Putin, or to be responsible for &apos;losing Ukraine&apos; the way the Biden &apos;lost&apos; Afghanistan,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He wants to be seen as a peacemaker who ends, rather than starts, wars &#x2014; and that he wants to look &apos;strong&apos; in doing so.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;the only way (Trump) could end this war as quickly as he promised in his campaign is if he could get Ukraine to surrender.&quot; &quot;I doubt that Trump fancies having an outright defeat in Ukraine get labeled as &apos;Trump&apos;s Afghanistan&apos; &#x2014; not a good look for someone as obsessed with winning as he is,&quot; he added. But some of Trump&apos;s statements point in the opposite direction. He claimed on Jan. 7 that Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership had led to the war. He also claimed, without any evidence, that there had been a deal that Ukraine would not join the alliance. &quot;They had a deal (not to let Ukraine into NATO), and then Biden broke it,&quot; Trump said. Mathers argued that &quot;if Putin is able to persuade (Trump) that the only path to a stable peace is by Russia getting all of its demands met, there is a real danger that Trump will agree to support that position.&quot; &quot;The experience of his first term as president suggests that he is impatient and not good at nurturing the kind of process that would be required to move from the current situation to a stable peace. This may not be good news for Ukraine,&quot; she added. Mathers also said that &quot;Trump seems more attracted by the simple solution to a problem than trying to work through complexity, such as what kind of a meaningful security guarantee for Ukraine would the U.S. be willing to support.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;to get a deal that doesn&apos;t look like a sellout, Trump will probably have to threaten a major expansion in U.S. support for Ukraine unless Putin compromises and that will be both risky and counter to the increasing anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Trump&apos;s base.&quot; &quot;So, I suspect that Trump may stall and try to change the subject rather than facing the uncomfortable choice between midwifing an embarrassing defeat and threatening an expensive and unpopular escalation,&quot; he added. But even if Trump&apos;s peace proposals favor Ukraine rather than Russia, a lot depends on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin&apos;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Jan. 10 that the Kremlin &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s &quot;readiness&quot; for talks but added that plans for any face-to-face meeting would not be drawn up until after his inauguration. Trump also said on Jan. 13 that he planned to meet Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. &quot;I actually find the prospect of a face to face meeting between the two men very alarming, especially if no other comparable political figures are present,&quot; Mathers told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We know that Trump admires Putin as the archetype of the strong man leader that Trump himself aspires to be.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin during a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)She added that, after a meeting between Putin and Trump at the 2018 Helsinki summit, &quot;Trump emerged looking beaten down and Putin was full of smiles.&quot; &quot;Everything Trump said at the press conference immediately afterward suggested that Putin got whatever he asked for, or at least persuaded Trump to echo Russian talking points in public,&quot; she added. The Helsinki meeting, conducted on the backdrop of the revelations that Russia had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, had drawn criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Russia has so far refused to agree to any compromise. Putin said in June 2024 that Moscow would only agree to a ceasefire and enter peace talks if Ukrainian troops withdraw from Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Ukraine maintains control of the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, holds a substantial part of Donetsk Oblast, and maintains a foothold in Luhansk Oblast. The Kremlin&apos;s other demands include the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia, Ukraine&apos;s refusal to join NATO, &quot;demilitarization&quot; &#x2014; most likely implying the decrease in the number of Ukrainian military personnel &#x2014; and &quot;denazification&quot; &#x2014; a likely reference to restrictions on nationalist parties and giving Russia an ability to bolster pro-Russian parties in the country. Meanwhile, Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 19, imposing new sanctions on the country&apos;s pro-Russian politicians and propagandists. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29 that the Kremlin was dissatisfied with the reported peace proposals on Ukraine from Trump&apos;s team. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) chairs a meeting regarding the situation in the Kursk region, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, Russia on Aug. 12, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Experts... tend to concur that Russia will not begin to face extremely tough constraints on its war effort during 2025, certainly not over the six months we&apos;re talking about,&quot; William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Hence, most do not expect Putin to be in the mood to make any kind of reasonable concessions.&quot; He said, &quot;The real question is, what does the Trump administration do when it discovers this?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m sure Trump really does want a deal, and I&apos;m sure he&apos;s prepared to use U.S. aid conditionality as a lever with Kyiv to get one,&quot; Biddle said. &quot;The problem here is Putin, who seems unlikely to accept anything that isn&apos;t actually tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s position appears to be the opposite of Russia&apos;s demands. Zelensky&apos;s peace formula envisages punishing those responsible for war crimes, withdrawing all Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, restoration of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, and the release of all prisoners of war and deportees. Mathers said that &quot;the most difficult element to resolve will be providing Ukraine with meaningful security guarantees, and without this in place, I assume that Kyiv would be very reluctant to agree to a peace deal.&quot; &quot;It is also important to remember that Ukraine will have a voice in this process,&quot; Graham said. &quot;There will be no deal without Kyiv&apos;s approval. While Washington might have leverage over Kyiv, it lacks the ability &#x2014; and I would imagine the will&#x2014; to impose a deal on Kyiv. What is (Ukraine) prepared to concede in order to achieve a lasting peace?	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trump-prepares-to-take-office-kyiv-awaits-his-teams-next-moves/	2025-01-19T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194069797.jpg
Fico accuses Slovak opposition leader of 'kissing Zelensky's ring'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico accused opposition leader Michal Simecka of &quot;kissing Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; during his recent visit to Kyiv and said the MP wanted to stage a coup d&apos;etat in Bratislava. Simecka, the pro-Western leader of the Progressive Slovakia party, headed a delegation of Slovak opposition MPs on a visit to Kyiv Jan. 17. The aim of the visit was to &quot;reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka said. In an address posted to Facebook late on Jan. 18, Fico said the delegates were &quot;kissing (President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; and &quot;promising him support for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO.&quot; Fico said the opposition wanted to stage a coup and alluded to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan revolution in his accusation. &quot;We are preparing for all possible alternatives,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be ready for everything. Especially for Maidan, that is, a coup d&apos;etat across the street, which the opposition, especially Progressive Slovakia, is so tenaciously trying to achieve.&quot; Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. &#xA0;He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. As tensions mount, Zelensky and Fico have signaled they may hold talks in the coming days. Fico told reporters on Jan. 16 that he might meet with Zelensky at an unspecified location in the &quot;next few days.&quot; Zelensky on Jan. 17 invited Fico to visit Kyiv. &#xA0; In his address, Fico showed no signs of softening his rhetoric against Ukraine. &quot;Robert Fico is the Slovak Prime Minister, not a Ukrainian servant,&quot; he said. The prime minister said he would likely veto future financial aid to Ukraine from the European Union and reiterated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;The government I lead will never support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO, because it would only lead to World War III,&quot; Fico said. &quot;The government will also never propose sending soldiers to Ukraine to turn their weapons against the Russian Federation.&quot; Fico&apos;s friendliness towards the Kremlin has sparked outrage both at home and abroad. His meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December drew condemnation from other European leaders. Mass protests erupted in Bratislava in early January, with thousands chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot; A coalition of Slovak opposition parties announced on Jan. 14 that they planned to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-slovak-opposition-leader-of-kissing-zelenskys-ring/	2025-01-19T09:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Syria bans goods from Russia, Iran, Israel	Syria&apos;s new administration has banned all Russian, Iranian, and Israeli goods from entering the country in a new decree issued by the country&apos;s finance minister on Jan. 17. Any relevant goods discovered at land and sea border crossings will be confiscated, according to the ban, reported regional media outlets. The decision came shortly after the country had restricted entry of Iranian and Israeli passport holders. Ukraine has moved quickly to restore ties with Syria after rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha visited Syria, marking the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he said he hoped to increase trade with Syria. As the new Syrian government looks to establish itself and reset foreign relations with its former partners and adversaries, the trade ban may exacerbate tensions in the region and impact trade.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-bans-goods-from-russia-iran-and-israel/	2025-01-19T07:53:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Lack of medical treatment, problems with unit transfers are most common causes of appeals, new military ombudsman says	Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. &#xA0; More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. In one appeal that she cited, a serviceman with HIV voluntarily mobilized at the start of the war, but has since developed bleeding ulcers and faces worsening health effects. The soldier received a referral for surgery but was threatened with a desertion complaint if he left. While Reshetylova said she is personally calling commanders in some cases to address the issues, &quot;attention to the health of a serviceman should become a priority for both military doctors, unit commanders, and the entire system as a whole,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not difficult to understand that in such a state the effectiveness of performing combat missions is low, and the mortality rate among servicemen due to diseases will grow. In addition, in the case of untreated mental disorder, a serviceman can pose a danger either to himself or to his comrades,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&#x2019;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&#x2019;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. The third largest category of appeals comprised of questions from relatives of prisoners of war missing soldiers, according to Reshetylova. &#xA0; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. The ombudsman &quot;will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of service members, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of service members and their families,&quot; the Defense Ministry said at the time. Reshetylova previously co-founded and headed the Media Initiative for Human Rights, which has investigated war crimes related to the Russian war in Ukraine since 2016 and advocates for changes in government policies and social practices related to protecting human rights.	https://kyivindependent.com/lack-of-medical-treatment-and-problems-with-unit-transfers-are-most-common-causes-of-appeals-to-new-military-obudsman/	2025-01-19T06:12:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1240353607-1.jpeg
Zelensky imposes new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. He also noted that the country is working to deprive them of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky to strip the Hero of Ukraine award from parliamentary member Yuriy Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. &quot;There are still many names in the request for the revocation of awards,&quot; lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said after the parliamentary vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-imposes-new-sanctions-on-pro-russian-propagandists/	2025-01-19T05:28:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Slovenia provides Ukraine's State Emergency Service with specialized demining, transport vehicles	Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service announced Jan. 18 that it received three specialized demining vehicles from Slovenia. The vehicles, Cossack PM-L specialized off-road trucks, can be used for demining and for transporting equipment and explosive objects.

Officials believe Baltic Sea cable damage caused by accidents, not Russian sabotage, WP reports	Amid a series of incidents that have damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly convinced that they were caused by accidents, according to a report by the Washington Post on Jan. 19. The incidents had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. The Washington Post report cited senior officials from three countries involved in investigating the cause of the incidents, who said they found no evidence that the ships suspected of dragging anchors across the cables were directed by Moscow or that they damaged the cables intentionally. The officials instead noted that intercepted communications and classified intelligence pointed to maritime accidents as the likely cause. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The events had heightened tension between Russia and Europe, as Russian activities have been linked to intensifying hybrid warfare attacks across the continent, including cyberattacks, espionage, and election interference. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that U.S. officials warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to carry out plan plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes. Intelligence sources suspect Russia was behind similar cases last summer when packages mailed by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K.	https://kyivindependent.com/officials-increasingly-believe-baltic-sea-cable-damage-caused-by-accidents-not-russian-sabotage-washington-post-reports/	2025-01-19T04:04:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258782719.jpg
Ukraine downs 43 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 43 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 19. Russia launched Shahed-type drones and decoy drones from bases in Millerovo, Oryol, and Bryansk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of 15 decoy drones Russia launched alongside the attack drones, saying that this resulted in no negative effects. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv oblasts. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine jumped to record levels at the end of 2024, with Moscow planning to ramp up its production or UAVs in 2025. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure.

Merkel highlights NATO's role in supporting Ukraine, urges transatlantic unity, media reports	Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has emphasized the critical role of the United States and NATO in ensuring Ukraine&apos;s independence amid Russia&apos;s invasion. Speaking at the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU&apos;s New Year&apos;s reception in D&#xFC;sseldorf, Merkel said that the transatlantic partnership is more essential now than ever, underscoring its importance as Donald Trump prepared to take office as U.S. president. &quot;The attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin has shattered the principle of territorial integrity that underpinned Europe&#x2019;s post-war order,&quot; Merkel said, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She argued that only through a united NATO effort, with strong U.S. leadership, can Putin&apos;s ambitions be thwarted and Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty preserved. Merkel described Trump as a &quot;unique president&quot; who focuses on defending U.S. interests but views international cooperation as a zero-sum game. Unlike multilateral approaches that seek mutual benefit, Trump operates on the belief that every negotiation produces a winner and a loser, she said. While acknowledging that Trump&#x2019;s outlook cannot be changed, Merkel urged Europe to consolidate its own interests and remain a steadfast partner to the U.S. &quot;Europe is our life insurance,&quot; she said, highlighting the continent&#x2019;s strategic value in global alliances. Merkel also took aim at the challenges facing Germany&#x2019;s current government and expressed her support for Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, to take the chancellorship after the upcoming federal election on Feb. 23. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/merkel-highlights-natos-role-in-supporting-ukraine-urges-transatlantic-unity-media-reports/	2025-01-18T21:55:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2154776902.jpg
Russia condemns 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and UK	Russia criticized a newly announced 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K., rejecting any cooperation between the two nations in the Azov Sea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Jan. 18 declared such claims to the region a &quot;gross interference&quot; in Russia&#x2019;s affairs, claiming they would face firm resistance. The Kremlin expressed concern on Jan. 17 over potential deployment of British military assets in Ukraine under the agreement, particularly in the Azov Sea. Russia views the sea as part of its territory, citing its proximity to Russian borders, areas of southern Ukraine under Russian occupation, and Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zakharova dismissed the agreement as meaningless from Russia&#x2019;s perspective, calling it a &quot;PR campaign&quot; by Kyiv. She added that Moscow considers the Sea of Azov an &quot;internal sea.&quot; The partnership, announced on Jan. 16 during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, includes commitments to strengthen military cooperation in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azov. Starmer pledged to support Ukraine with robust security guarantees if negotiations for a ceasefire with Russia move forward. The agreement marked Starmer&#x2019;s first visit to Ukraine as prime minister and highlighted the U.K.&apos;s continued support for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Starmer described the long-term partnership as a commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s security and sovereignty. Russia&#x2019;s objections underline ongoing tensions over control of the Azov Sea, a strategic waterway central to both economic and military interests in the region. Moscow&#x2019;s position signals potential challenges to Ukraine and U.K.&#x2019;s efforts to enhance cooperation in contested areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-100-year-partnership-agreement-between-ukraine-and-uk/	2025-01-18T21:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/213eb4fab6527c39e0ce5fa008b4f0b8_1737025391_extra_large.jpeg
Trump eyes China visit amid strained ties, WSJ reports	President-elect Donald Trump has expressed interest in visiting China shortly after assuming office, potentially within his first 100 days, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. This potential trip would aim to stabilize relations with Beijing, strained by Trump&#x2019;s pledge to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. While Trump&#x2019;s transition team has not commented, advisers have also discussed the possibility of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United States to jump-start dialogue on critical issues. A possible meeting with Xi could come during a pivotal moment for U.S.-China relations, as both leaders navigate fraught economic and geopolitical challenges, including the war in Ukraine, trade disputes, and Taiwan&#x2019;s status. Trump and Xi spoke by phone on Jan. 17 for the first time since the November election, addressing various topics including trade, the fentanyl crisis, and the social media platform TikTok. Trump shared his optimism about their collaboration, sharing on social media that he expects the two nations will &quot;solve many problems together, starting immediately.&quot; During the conversation, however, Xi underscored the importance of handling Taiwan prudently, emphasizing its significance to China&apos;s sovereignty, according to the Wall Street Journal Beijing&#x2019;s official account of the call highlighted plans to establish a strategic communication channel between the two leaders. Trump reportedly conveyed his eagerness to meet Xi in person, though it remains unclear if a potential visit to China was explicitly discussed. Xi declined an invitation to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, opting instead to send Vice President Han Zheng, a figure seen as a pragmatist in Washington and a signal of Beijing&#x2019;s openness to future negotiations. China&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine looms large in the broader U.S.-China dynamic. Beijing has provided indirect support to Moscow, drawing criticism from American lawmakers. While Trump did not reference the war in his post-call remarks, he suggested a desire to work with Xi to promote global stability, saying: &quot;President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-eyes-china-visit-amid-strained-ties-wsj-reports/	2025-01-18T19:25:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Russia's Jan. 18 attack damages Ukraine's oldest McDonald’s in Kyiv	A Russian missile strike on Kyiv early on Jan. 18 damaged Ukraine&apos;s oldest McDonald&#x2019;s, located near the Lukianivska metro station in the city&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi district. Open since 1997, this is the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant in the country. McDonald&#x2019;s Ukraine confirmed the damage in a statement: &quot;Today, during an aerial attack on Kyiv, a McDonald&#x2019;s restaurant near the Lukianivska metro station was damaged. Our staff were able to evacuate to a shelter in time thanks to our safety protocols.&quot; The restaurant is currently closed but the company pledged to repair the damages. Kyiv remains a frequent target of Russian attacks since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The missile attack caused significant destruction in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Three people&#x2014;a 41-year-old woman and two men aged 25 and 43&#x2014;were killed, and three others sustained injuries, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported additional damage in the area, including shattered windows and smoke filling the entrance of a residential building. The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station was also damaged in the attack. Several cars caught fire, and a water pipeline was damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-jan-18-attack-damages-ukraines-oldest-mcdonalds-in-kyiv/	2025-01-18T15:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193884529-2.jpg
Germany may consider sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, defense minister says	Germany may consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on January 18. The idea of sending a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as EU countries prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. When asked if Germany was prepared to deploy troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire agreement, Pistorius indicated that Berlin was open to the idea. &quot;We&apos;re the largest NATO partner in Europe. We&apos;ll obviously have a role to play,&quot; Pistorius said in an interview with the German media outlet Suddeutsche Zeitung. The matter will &quot;be discussed in due time,&quot; Pistorius said. The U.K. and France are reportedly already discussing the possibility of deploying French and British troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the option with President Volodymyr Zelensky during their meeting in Kyiv. French President Emmanuel Macron, who first floated the idea of European troops in Ukraine, has also been in talks with Zelensky regarding future peacekeepers. Zelensky has previously said that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Other German politicians have also commented on the issue of deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine. Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3 that Berlin should not rule out the possibility. Friedrich Merz, the opposition CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s candidate for chancellor in the upcoming parliamentary elections, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-may-consider-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-18T13:51:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193104154.jpg
Students who fail military exam or refuse oath cannot continue higher ed, official says	Ukrainian university students who fail the basic military training exam or refuse to swear the military oath will not be permitted to continue their studies, Deputy Defense Minister Serhii Melnyk said on Jan. 18. Melnyk&apos;s comments follow the Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Jan. 17 that basic military training for students enrolled in higher education institutions will begin in September 2025. &quot;I would like to emphasize that (basic military training) is mandatory for everyone,&quot; Melnyk said. &quot;And if students cannot pass the exam for some reason or pass it unsatisfactorily, if they refuse to take the military oath, they will not be able to study in higher education institutions in the future.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky approved an updated version of the law on military service in Ukraine that stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theoretical study and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theoretical portion is compulsory for both men and women, ages 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Following completion of the training course, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. The law reflects the changes Ukraine&apos;s educational institutions have undergone since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian goverment has amended enrollment policies to curb draft evasion and launched drone education programs. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program updating the Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since the Soviet era. The updated subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/students-who-fail-military-exam-or-refuse-oath-cannot-continue-studies-official-says/	2025-01-18T13:05:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/melnyk.png
Ukrainian troops withdraw from, launch attack on Chasiv Yar refractory plant	Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. The front-line city of Chasiv Yar has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in eastern Ukraine. The city has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July. Fighting has recently intensified near the city, with Russian forces reportedly using armored combat vehicles in their assault for the first time in late December.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-from-launch-attack-on-chasiv-yar-refractory-plant-military-says/	2025-01-18T12:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1607100920.jpg
Dnipropetrovsk firm helped Russia build nuclear weapons labs, SBU says	A building materials company in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast sent metal products to the Russian Federation that were used to build nuclear weapons laboratories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 18, following an investigation into the firm. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Representatives of the company allegedly shipped a large-scale batch of stainless steel profiles to Russia after the full-scale invasion in 2022, the SBU said. These products were used to outfit the Russian Institute for Nuclear Research. In these labs, &quot;the Russians are developing designs for new models of nuclear-powered missile weapons,&quot; the SBU said. To conceal the shipment to Russia, dealers first sent the materials to a third-party company in the Middle East, according to the investigation. From there, the goods were exported to Russia. Investigators said they uncovered evidence of criminal activity in mobile phones, computer equipment, and documents seized during searches of the company and of suspects&apos; apartments. The owner of the company and three subordinates have been charged with providing assistance to an aggressor state. The suspects face a sentence of up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property if convicted.	https://kyivindependent.com/dnipropetrovsk-firm-helped-russia-build-nuclear-weapons-labs-sbu-says/	2025-01-18T11:10:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/SBU2.jpg
SBU detains metro engineer who allegedly directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, Kharkiv	A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The engineer allegedly recruited acquaintances into the network, including a Kharkiv resident who deserted the Ukrainian military and previously worked for Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) for 10 years. This agent tracked and reported on the movements of Ukraine&apos;s military. Another agent, an international road transport driver, identified and shared the coordinates of military checkpoints. The ringleader then passed this intelligence on to the FSB, the SBU claimed. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged. The suspects face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-detains-metro-engineer-who-allegedly-directed-russian-missile-strikes-on-kyiv-kharkiv/	2025-01-18T10:11:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbuykyiv.jpeg
Russia used chemical weapons 434 times in December, Ukraine's General Staff says	Russian forces used chemical weapons on the battlefield 434 times in December 2024, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 18. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units have been monitoring and recording the use of hazardous chemicals in attacks. The military has recorded 5,389 cases since February 2023. Russian forces used K-51 and RG-VO munitions, anti-riot weapons that are prohibited for use in warfare, the General Staff said in their report. Russia has also used ammunition loaded with dangerous chemicals of &quot;unspecified type.&quot; The use of such weapons &quot;grossly violates the rules of warfare,&quot; the General Staff said. The report noted that chemical weapons attacks have &quot;become systemic&quot; since February 2023. Russia has been intensifying its use of chemical agents on the battlefield in Ukraine. A Kyiv Independent investigation from August 2024 showed that instances of gas attacks are rising, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed on Nov. 18 that a riot control agent known as CS has been used in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said on Dec. 13. Ukraine struck back at Russia&apos;s use of illegal chemical weapons on Dec. 17, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) assassinated Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops. The previous day, Ukrainain prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-chemical-weapons-434-times-in-december-ukraines-general-staff-says/	2025-01-18T09:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2121052659.jpg
Direct threat' — Ukraine's 48th Separate Assault Battalion denounces commander replacement	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 48th Separate Assault Battalion spoke out against the replacement of their commander Lenur Islyamov in a video address to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi published on Jan. 18. The battalion is currently based in the town of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces that has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to the soldiers, they were deployed there 10 days ago after almost a year spent defending another hot spot in the region. &#xA0;Following the redeployment, the battalion learned that Isyamov had been replaced by another commander. &quot;Changing the commander at a critical moment is a direct threat to the unit&apos;s combat capability and undermines the trust of the fighters,&quot; the statement read. The servicemembers praised Islyamov for forming and leading a battalion that consists of 90% volunteers. &quot;We have not surrendered a single position. Instead, we have conducted dozens of successful operations. During this time, we recaptured several settlements where Ukrainian flags were planted,&quot; one soldier said. &quot;All this was possible only thanks to the experience, professionalism, and dedication of our commander.&quot; The soldiers also said that they were not provided with necessary intelligence information after their redeployment. The Ukrainian military leadership has not yet commented on the address. This is the latest appeal by the Ukrainian military in support of a commander allegedly about to be removed. In the summer of 2024, soldiers from Ukraine&apos;s 24th Mechanized Brigade spoke out to oppose the dismissal of its commander, Ivan Holishevskyi. Later, officers from Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade called on Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership to keep brigade commander Emil Ishkulov in his post.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-48th-assault-battalion-denounces-commander-replacement/	2025-01-18T08:16:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-18-174743.png
Lukashenko frees 23 more Belarusian political prisoners	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko freed 23 Belarusians convicted of &quot;extremist crimes,&quot; his press office reported on Jan. 18. Lukashenko has pardoned political prisoners in rounds since July, a move that many see as an attempt to boost his approval rating ahead of the 2025 presidential election. However, political persecution continues in Belarus, according to human rights activists. The eighth round of &quot;pardons&quot; includes three women and 20 men. More than half of them are over 50 years old. Fourteen people have chronic diseases, according to the statement. The names of the released convicts have not been revealed. Since the first round of pardons on July 3, timed to coincide with Independence Day in Belarus, over 200 political prisoners have been reportedly released. Nearly 1,300 prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, Viasna Human Rights Center reported. However, the Lukashenko regime is continuing its crackdown on dissent. In fact, arbitrary repression of political opponents has intensified in Belarus in the run-up to the 2025 presidential elections, the Viasna said. Over November and December, human rights activists added 120 new names to the list of recognized political prisoners in Belarus. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and is looking to reelect himself for the seventh time.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-frees-23-more-political-prisoners-in-belarus/	2025-01-18T06:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1257107756.jpg
Ex-MP, leader of Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church charged with treason	Ukrainian law enforcement officers charged former lawmaker and businessman Vadym Novynskyi with high treason and incitement to religious hatred in absentia, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said. The SBI didn&apos;t mention the suspect&apos;s name, but the description and the video made it clear that this was Novynskyi. Novynskyi is an ex-lawmaker from the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc, which was banned in Ukraine shortly after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, and sponsor of the Moscow-backed church in Ukraine. For years, Novynskyi was listed among the richest Ukrainians, with Forbes estimating his wealth at $1.4 billion in the spring of 2023. According to the investigation, Novynskyi has been publicly promoting Russian narratives since Moscow&apos;s invasion in 2014. &quot;The MP tried to form anti-government and pro-Russian sentiments in Ukrainian society, justify Russian aggression, etc.,&quot; the SBI said. Law enforcement officials called Novynskyi a &quot;handler&quot; of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Ukraine. In December 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions against him and other leaders of the Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The former MP followed the instructions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, maintained close ties with him for a long time, and was hierarchically subordinate to him, the statement read. After the start of the full-scale invasion, Novynskyi resigned from Ukraine&apos;s parliament and fled abroad. He continues &quot;to assist Russia in conducting subversive information activities,&quot; the SBI said. If detained and convicted, he might face up to 15 years in prison with or without confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-mp-leader-of-russia-affiliated-ukrainian-orthodox-church-charged-with-treason/	2025-01-18T05:47:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-628589626.jpg
Former pro-Russian lawmaker charged with treason resurfaces in China	Former Ukrainian pro-Russian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev published a two-hour propaganda interview on Jan. 17, marking his first public appearance after almost three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Murayev was a lawmaker between 2012 and 2019, and later led the pro-Russian Nashi party until it was banned in June 2022. He also was the owner of Nash TV channel, which was banned in 2022 for spreading the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda. Murayev fled Ukraine in May 2022. He said in the interview that he lived in Beijing with his family. He refused to say how he managed to leave Ukraine. In the interview, Murayev parroted Russian propaganda, blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. The ex-lawmaker opposed Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO accession and criticized Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. He said that his reappearance is not related to the post-war elections, which have been the subject of speculations in Ukraine in recent months. &quot;I&apos;m not running for any position, and I don&apos;t see any possibility of returning to Ukraine yet. At least in the short term,&quot; Murayev said. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Murayev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Murayev called on Kyiv to capitulate. In the summer of 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) charged Murayev with high treason.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-politician-charged-with-treason-resurfaces-in-china/	2025-01-18T04:34:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1151714517.jpg
24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier killed in action near Bakhmut	Maria Zaitseva, a 24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action near the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 17, Nasha Niva reported. Zaitseva joined the Ukrainian army after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war and fought with the 2nd International Legion Battalion. She turned 24 on Jan. 16, a day before she was killed by Russian forces. In August 2020, Zaitseva participated in the protests in Minsk against alleged presidential election fraud in Belarus. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed to have won elections by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoking nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. During protests, fragments of a flash grenade severely injured Zaitseva&apos;s arm and head. Her photo from the protests with her face covered in blood went viral. &quot;Gravely injured during the 2020 Belarus protests, she gave her life for freedom,&quot; said Belarusian opposition leader Svitlana Tsikhanouskaya, describing Zaitseva as &quot;an icon of our revolution.&quot; This is utterly heartbreaking.

Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Tula Oblast, source claims	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast overnight on Jan. 18, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the drones, operated by HUR, hit the oil depot at least 10 times in this attack. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort, as well as its military hardware. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone attacks targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones also reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-tula-oblast-source-claims/	2025-01-18T00:47:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 9, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed nine people and injured at least 38 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 24 out of the 39 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 14 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Russia also launched four ballistic missiles of either the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model in the early hours of Jan. 18, with two of them downed by Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Fallen wreckage from the downed missiles killed four people and injured at least three others in Kyiv, according to local authorities. The attack damaged a water pipeline, an administrative building, a business center, a store, and cars, the State Emergency Service said. The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station and the neighboring McDonald&apos;s building were also damaged.

At least 10 people suffered injuries, he added. A Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed five people and injured 19 others, including four children, said Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city&apos;s military administration. Among the victims are four women aged 61, 50, 43, and 22, as well as a 20-year-old man. The attack damaged four high-rise buildings, houses and an educational institution, Governor Serhii Lysak said. One person was also injured in the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 31 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed, and five others were injured over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-1-injure-16-over-past-day-2/	2025-01-18T00:30:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193884644.jpg

Hungary's Orban defends ally Antal Rogan sanctioned by US, media reports	Sanctions imposed by the outgoing U.S. administration against Antal Rogan, Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s cabinet chief and overseer of the secret service, have only strengthened Rogan&apos;s position, Orban said during a state radio interview on Jan. 17. In his first comments since the U.S. sanctioned Rogan earlier this month for alleged corruption, Orban defended his close ally. The prime minister&#x2019;s cabinet office dismissed the sanctions as the &quot;last, petty revenge&quot; of the departing U.S. ambassador. &quot;(Rogan) is the minister in charge of national security services, the number one guardian of Hungarian national sovereignty and if he is punished by a big power that means he does his job well, so this is our starting point,&quot; Orban told the broadcaster, according to Reuters. A long-time supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, Orban expressed optimism for a &quot;golden era&quot; in U.S.-Hungarian relations under Trump&#x2019;s leadership. At home, Orban faces mounting challenges, including a rising opposition party and economic difficulties ahead of the 2026 elections. He pledged to intensify efforts to combat what he described as &quot;foreign networks&quot; undermining Hungary&#x2019;s sovereignty. Orban reiterated his criticism of Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose liberal ideals have been a consistent target. The prime minister declared his foreign policy objective for the year: &quot;to squeeze out the Soros empire from Europe,&quot; beginning with Hungary. &quot;It is time...for us to eliminate the foreign networks that pose a threat to Hungarian national sovereignty and send them home,&quot; he reportedly said. &quot;Hungary will likely be the first country (in Europe) to squeeze out the Soros empire, this is my definite goal for this year.&quot; For over a decade, Orban&apos;s Fidesz party has targeted Soros and his Open Society Foundations. In 2017, the government introduced stricter rules for foreign-funded NGOs, requiring them to register and disclose their funding sources publicly. Orban Defends Aide Sanctioned by U.S. A year later, Central European University, founded by Soros in 1991, began relocating most of its courses from Hungary to Vienna after a prolonged standoff with Orban&#x2019;s administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-defends-ally-antal-rogan-sanctioned-by-us/	2025-01-17T21:33:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1689139196.jpg
3 killed following Russia's attack on Kyiv	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack on Kyiv early in the morning on Jan. 18, killing at least three people, according to city authorities. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, windows were shattered, and smoke filled the entrance of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district. Several cars caught fire following the attack. A water supply pipeline was also damaged in the area. Repair crews have been dispatched to the site, according to Klitschko. &#xA0; The glass entrance to the Lukyanivska metro station was also damaged, Klitschko said, adding that the station is currently closed for entry and exit, with trains bypassing it without stopping. Debris were detected in the city&apos;s Desnianskyi district, Kyiv city military administration head Tymur Tkachenko reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-killed-following-russias-attack-on-kyiv/	2025-01-17T20:20:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1245581440.jpg
Fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Tula Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility overnight on Jan. 18, regional Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town. Milyaev claimed that there were not casualties as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. No information on the extent of the damage was immediately available. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as the country attempts to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supplychain. On Nov. 9, sources told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian drones struck the Aleksinsky chemical plant in the region, which produces gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Amid an uptick in drone attacks, Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, Reuters reported on Jan. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-depot-in-russias-tula-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-17T17:15:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
Media identifies nearly 89,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-December, the names of 3,965 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The confirmed death toll now includes 20,200 volunteers, 15,300 recruited prisoners, and 10,300 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 4,600 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. The journalists note that as Russian military equipment dwindles, commanders may be forced to provide less protective equipment to soldiers, highlighted by their use of civilian cars in attacks &#x2014; which ultimately may lead to a higher casualty rate. As of Jan. 17, Russia has lost a total of 815,820 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement in early December that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-nearly-89-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-17T16:54:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Debris from Russian drones found in Romanian border town, defense ministry confirms	Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed on Jan. 17 that it had found Russian drone fragments in two communities situated on the Romania-Ukraine border. The two attack drones, located in the communities of Chatalchioi and Kiliya Veche in Tulcea County, were found following a Russian overnight drone attack on Ukraine. Residents in the Romanian border communities received air raid alerts amid the attack. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported it had downed 33 out of the 50 drones launched by Russia overnight on Jan. 16 - 17. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said that the Russian drones did not cause any casualties or damage. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones have been found on Romanian territory, which is a NATO country. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. In previous incidents, Romania&apos;s military scrambled F-16 fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s own airspace. The country previously published a draft law that would allow the military to shoot down aircraft that illegally violate Romania&apos;s airspace. Despite the legislative efforts, Bucharest has yet to down Russian drones over its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/debris-from-russian-drones-found-in-romanian-border-town-defense-ministry-confirms/	2025-01-17T14:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg
French patrol aircraft was 'target of Russian intimidation' over Baltic Sea, French defense minister says	A French maritime patrol aircraft was the target of intimidation tactics over the Baltic Sea overnight on Jan. 17, after the aircraft was locked onto by the radar of a Russian ground-to-air defense system, France&apos;s Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on social media. The aircraft was patrolling in international airspace over the Baltic Sea overnight between Jan. 16 - 17 as part of a NATO operation, the defense minister said. &quot;This aggressive Russian action is not acceptable,&quot; Lecornu wrote on X. &quot;Our armies will continue to act to defend freedom of navigation in international air and maritime spaces.&quot; The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. On Dec. 25, four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea were damaged, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. Following the incident, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte vowed to increase NATO&apos;s military presence in the region. On Jan. 14, eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan to address risks to underwater infrastructure following the suspected sabotage. In addition to sabotage efforts, Russia has been repeatedly accused of jamming the GPS signal of various aircrafts, particularly in the Baltic Sea region. In March, Russia likely jammed the satellite signal of a Royal Air Force aircraft used to transport then-U.K. Defence Minister Grant Shapps near Kaliningrad. On Dec. 9, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea. Later they were also scrambled again to intercept a Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft. Russian aircraft frequently operate over the Baltic Sea without transponders or flight plans, actions often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities. .	https://kyivindependent.com/french-patrol-aircraft-was-target-of-russian-intimidation-over-baltic-sea-french-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-17T13:44:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1625904649.jpg
Fire erupts at oil depot in Russia's Kaluga Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at a oil depot in the city of Lyudinovo in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility on Jan. 17, regional Governor Vladislav Shapsha said. Various Russian Telegram channels, citing residents, reported sounds of explosions in the region. Videos which appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the city were posted to social media. Shapsha confirmed a fire had erupted at a &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 9:30 p.m. local time, additionally claiming that no casualties had been sustained as a result of the attack.

US imposes sanctions against Russian oil tankers under construction for 1st time	Six Russian oil tankers still under construction at Russia&apos;s Zvezda shipyard have been targeted by U.S. sanctions imposed last week, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. The latest sanctions targeted over 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. For the first time, Washington imposed a ban on the use of tankers even before they went to sea or transported sanctioned cargo. The sanctions will impact named vessels including the Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Alexander Beggrov, the Alexey Bogolyubov, as well as three yet to be named vessels listed as Zvezda 131080, Zvezda 131060, and Zvezda 131040, according to Reuters. The Alexander Beggrov and Alexey Bogolyubov were purchased by the Russian company Sovcomflot. The other four tankers were bought by Rosneft&apos;s shipping division Rosnefteflot. Both buyers of the vessels are under sanctions. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to undermine Russian oil exports, which are one of the key fuels of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-for-1st-time-against-russian-oil-tankers-under-construction/	2025-01-17T12:23:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia, Iran sign strategic partnership deal; Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment	Key developments on Jan. 17: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed a strategic partnership agreement in Moscow on Jan. 17, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Moscow and Tehran have long ties but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.The document, signed during an official ceremony in the Kremlin, establishes Moscow and Tehran as strategic partners. The agreement covers various areas, including energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and counterterrorism. Russia and Iran have also agreed to strengthen cooperation in security and defense. According to the agreement, if one of the parties is subjected to aggression, the other will not provide any assistance to the aggressor. Moscow and Tehran will also deepen partnerships between their special services, and will assist each other in the event of natural, and man-made disasters. The strategic agreement between Russia and Iran is concluded for 20 years with automatic extension for subsequent 5-year periods. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with namely Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West&apos;s allies. Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of an advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read. Ukrainian forces also attacked positions of the radar company of Russia&apos;s radio engineering battalion of the 336th regiment in Belgorod Oblast. Damage to vehicles and equipment was recorded, the military said. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast lies at the border with Ukraine and is regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Ukraine also struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, the General Staff claimed. Also, a drone strike reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast the same night. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has declassified previously undisclosed efforts to support Ukraine&apos;s drone industry, including $1.5 billion funding sent in September 2024, The New York Times reported on Jan. 17, citing anonymous officials. Ukrainian drones have been utilized for reconnaissance, combat, and other missions, showcasing their versatility and impact in countering Russian forces. U.S. intelligence officers reportedly assisted in advancing Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities, helping to design a new generation of drones intended to revolutionize modern warfare. While much of the U.S. aid for Ukraine has been publicly disclosed &#x2014; covering missiles, air defense systems, tanks, and training &#x2014; support for the drone sector has largely remained secret. The declassified data reveals that the U.S. allocated funds for drone manufacturing and facilitated partnerships between U.S. tech companies and Ukrainian drone producers. These efforts intensified during preparations for Ukraine&apos;s 2023 counteroffensive, which struggled to achieve significant territorial gains, reportedly due to Russia&apos;s extensive drone use. In response, the U.S. accelerated aid to Ukraine&apos;s drone sector. Officials reportedly believe this investment has made Ukrainian drones more effective and deadly. Ukrainian maritime drones, credited with destroying 25% of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, and aerial drones deployed on the front lines have slowed Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. By the end of 2024, Ukraine had delivered over 200,000 domestically produced drones to frontline units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in December. The United States has assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric. Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-iran-sign-strategic-partnership-ukraine-strikes-russian-s-400-radar-equipment/	2025-01-17T12:21:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193780871.jpg
Four Russian officers reportedly killed in Kursk Oblast by Ukraine's Dec. 30 strike	At least four Russian officers were killed in Ukraine&apos;s attack on the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Dec. 30, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17, citing recently published obituaries. Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of Kursk Oblast, claimed on Dec. 30 that the attack had injured an 86-year-old woman and damaged a two-story building. The Russian official did not mention any losses among the military. Yet, according to Mediazona, at least four officers of the 76th Air Assault Division with the rank of lieutenant colonel were killed by U.K.-made missiles. One of the killed was Lieutenant Colonel Valeriy Tereshchenko, Mediazona reported, citing an obituary from the Officers&apos; Hockey League page on social media. Eight people from the division&apos;s senior staff were killed, and 22 others were injured in the attack, the obituary read. Two more obituaries about Lieutenant Colonels Pavel Maletsky and Alexei Seliverstov were found by Mediazona on their relatives&apos; social media pages. Another killed officer is Major Ali Tsurov from Ingushetia, who also served in the 76th Air Assault Division, Mediazona reported, citing Russian media outlet Fortanka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukrainian troops carried out another attack on Lgov on Dec. 26, hitting a Russian command post. The attack allegedly killed 18 Russian soldiers. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-4-russian-officers-killed-in-kursk-oblast-as-result-of-ukrainian-dec-30-strike-media-reports/	2025-01-17T11:44:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240563519.jpg
It's not enough' — Ukrainians react to Biden's farewell speech	In his farewell speech from the White House on Jan.15, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden took the opportunity to highlight his achievements in office in an attempt to help cement his legacy. Yet, despite being one of the world&apos;s biggest international crises that spanned much of Biden&apos;s term in office, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine only gained a single mention. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&apos;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; Biden said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including a stronger NATO military alliance. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&apos;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&apos;ll grow, and they&apos;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; he added. The Biden administration provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, making it the largest donor in absolute terms. But how this aid was given has regularly attracted criticism, particularly over the speed of the decision-making process in the White House. Big ticket weapons, including heavy tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and the decision to greenlight long-range missile strikes deep inside Russian territory often only came after weeks or months of political wrangling, hampering Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back against Russian forces. Then there is Biden&apos;s assertion that &quot;Ukraine is free&quot; &#x2014; Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. We asked Ukrainians for their assessment of Biden&apos;s presidency, his legacy in regard to the full-scale invasion, and what he could have done more to help Ukraine. Professor at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, and research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation We are thankful to the U.S. and personally to President Biden for all the support they have given to Ukraine, including military support. It was of immense importance in rebuffing Vladimir Putin of Russia. I believe that for Biden, Ukraine became a personal issue that he took deeply into his heart. However, all the time support was delayed and not enough. There are different reasons for that but the main one is Putin&apos;s nuclear blackmail which worked, as in the case with other Western leaders, unfortunately. As a result we were not prepared enough for the counteroffensive in late 2022 and summer 2023. The lack of weapons and, therefore, the lack of success have decreased the levels of optimism for Ukrainian soldiers in the war of attrition and, among other reasons, created additional problems for mobilization.

(Leigh Vogel / UPI / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Khrystia VengryniukAuthor, and book publisher At the beginning of the war, I believed that NATO would intervene, protect us, that their planes would fly and close the sky over Ukraine, and that this hell would end very quickly. This did not happen. And when they were destroying Mariupol, I was simply convinced, minute to minute, from day to day, they would close the sky over at least this city, where thousands of people and children were killed every day. The world knew what was happening there, but no one intervened. Now they say that 117,000 people died in Mariupol, 15,000 of them children. This can only mean one thing &#x2014; everyone was afraid of Russia. They were so afraid that they could not even protect innocent civilians. But would we have survived as a state if it were not for America and Europe? No, we would not have survived. And the fact that we still exist is indeed a very great, if not the greatest, merit of the U.S. during the Biden presidency. All the weapons, aid, and sanctions from the U.S. helped us hold out. We lost 20% of our territory, we lost hundreds of thousands of people, but we are here and we will be, thanks to Joe Biden first and foremost. the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy I expected the outgoing U.S. president to devote more attention to Ukraine in his farewell speech. Ukraine was mentioned only once. I understand that it was worded very carefully, but it doesn&apos;t sound optimistic enough. It doesn&apos;t say something encouraging and certain about the future of Ukraine. I would like to hear from the outgoing president something more optimistic and encouraging, something like: &apos;The people of the U.S. will never leave Ukraine alone, and American friends of Ukraine will not allow anyone to throw Ukraine under the bus.&apos; This mention of Ukraine is just a statement of a fact, but it&apos;s not about our future. Just one mention of Ukraine after three years of difficult struggle is not enough. Biden knows that we are worried about our future in connection with the new administration, and a few more words of support and encouragement would be psychologically appropriate.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-not-enough-ukrainians-react-to-bidens-farewell-speech/	2025-01-17T10:44:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193208114.jpg
Ukraine ready to help Slovakia achieve energy stability, Zelensky says	Ukraine is ready for dialogue on energy security with Slovakia and can help it achieve energy stability, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 17 at a meeting with a delegation of the Progressive Slovakia political party, which is led by Michal Simecka. Zelensky&apos;s statement follows Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit via its territory, including supplies to Slovakia. Slovak Prime Minister Robet Fico has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Earlier on Jan. 17, pro-Western opposition leader Simecka arrived in Kyiv. The Slovak politician&apos;s visit comes a few days after Zelensky invited Fico to Ukraine&apos;s capital to discuss the energy situation. &quot;We are ready to help the Slovak people in ensuring their energy stability and security,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is very important for us to hear a signal from the Slovak people that you will also support Ukrainians on our path to the European Union and NATO. This is a key issue for us because of the war, because of the security guarantees that are very important for us.&quot; Zelensky added that the visit of the Slovak delegation &quot;is a signal&quot; that Slovakia will continue to support Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and independence. The president also reminded that he had invited Fico to Kyiv. &quot;We were ready to host the leader of our friends from Slovakia but another leader arrived,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-help-slovakia-achieve-energy-stability-zelensky-says/	2025-01-17T10:25:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg
Biden administration secretly funded Ukraine's drone industry, NYT reports	U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has declassified previously undisclosed efforts to support Ukraine&apos;s drone industry, including $1.5 billion funding sent in September 2024, The New York Times reported on Jan. 17, citing anonymous officials. Ukrainian drones have been utilized for reconnaissance, combat, and other missions, showcasing their versatility and impact in countering Russian forces. U.S. intelligence officers reportedly assisted in advancing Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities, helping to design a new generation of drones intended to revolutionize modern warfare. While much of the U.S. aid for Ukraine has been publicly disclosed &#x2014; covering missiles, air defense systems, tanks, and training &#x2014; support for the drone sector has largely remained secret. The declassified data reveals that the U.S. allocated funds for drone manufacturing and facilitated partnerships between U.S. tech companies and Ukrainian drone producers. These efforts intensified during preparations for Ukraine&apos;s 2023 counteroffensive, which struggled to achieve significant territorial gains, reportedly due to Russia&apos;s extensive drone use. In response, the U.S. accelerated aid to Ukraine&apos;s drone sector. Officials reportedly believe this investment has made Ukrainian drones more effective and deadly. Ukrainian maritime drones, credited with destroying 25% of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, and aerial drones deployed on the front lines have slowed Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. By the end of 2024, Ukraine had delivered over 200,000 domestically produced drones to frontline units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in December.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-admin-secretly-facilitated-ukraines-drone-industry-nyt-reports/	2025-01-17T09:09:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Basic military training to start in Ukrainian higher education institutions in September 2025	Basic general military training for students of Ukrainian higher education institutions will begin in September 2025, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 17. President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier approved amendments to the law on military duty and military service in Ukraine. The updated law stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theory study ,and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theory part is compulsory for both men and women, aged 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Women can attend it at their own request, having previously passed a medical examination. During the course, students will gain basic knowledge of tactical, intelligence, and psychological training, first aid, and the basics of military discipline. They will also master the skills of handling weapons, according to the ministry&apos;s statement. Following the basic military training, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. Men who complete the course will become liable for military service, but according to the law on mobilization training and mobilization, they will not be drafted into the army until they are 25 years old. Up until that age, they can do so voluntarily. As the full-scale invasion broke out, the Ukrainian government began reviewing educational programs in schools and higher education institutions to ensure that civilians were better prepared for the challenges posed by the war. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program of the updated Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since Soviet times. The updated program&apos;s subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/basic-general-military-training-to-start-in-ukrainian-higher-education-institutions-in-september-2025/	2025-01-17T07:54:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2136562481.jpg
Putin, Pezeshkian sign strategic Russia-Iran partnership agreement in Moscow	Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian have signed a strategic partnership agreement in Moscow on Jan. 17, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Moscow and Tehran have long ties but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.The document, signed during an official ceremony in the Kremlin, establishes Moscow and Tehran as strategic partners. The agreement covers various areas, including energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and counterterrorism. Russia and Iran have also agreed to strengthen cooperation in security and defense. According to the agreement, if one of the parties is subjected to aggression, the other will not provide any assistance to the aggressor. Moscow and Tehran will also deepen partnerships between their special services, and will assist each other in the event of natural, and man-made disasters. The strategic agreement between Russia and Iran is concluded for 20 years with automatic extension for subsequent 5-year periods. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with namely Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West&apos;s allies. Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-pezeshkian-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement-in-moscow/	2025-01-17T07:42:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2177151725.jpg
Belarus Week: Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills	OSCE observers not invited to monitor upcoming presidential election in Belarus. Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills with Russia. Belarus sentences EU diplomatic staffer to four years in prison. Irregular crossings into EU from eastern borders more than triple in 2024, Frontex reports. Belarusian state TV airs a propaganda film with jailed journalists, attempting to discredit their coverage of 2020 elections ahead of upcoming vote. Belarusian opposition announced it will issue &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passports, yet legal uncertainty remains for exiles. Minsk has not invited observers from the OSCE&#x2019;s Office for Democratic Institutions to monitor the upcoming presidential elections in Belarus, the OSCE announced on Jan. 9. The presidential elections, which are expected to provide Belarus&#x2019;s longtime dictator Alexander Lukashenko with a seventh term in office, are scheduled for Jan. 26. The poll, dismissed as a &#x201C;sham&#x201D; by the Belarusian opposition, will be the first presidential race since the 2020 election &#x2014; which sparked an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests and an ongoing domestic political crisis. The OSCE said Belarus&#x2019; decision not to invite its member states via the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) was &#x201C;regrettable&#x201D; and &#x201C;deprives the country&#x2019;s citizens of a transparent and full assessment of the entire process.&#x201D; &#x201C;The lack of transparency further undermines faith in the electoral system of Belarus,&#x201D; said OSCE PA President Pia Kauma. This is the third time the office will be unable to observe elections in Belarus since the contested 2020 vote &#x2014; it was not invited to observe the 2022 constitutional referendum or parliamentary elections. Speaking at a meeting with the chairs of regional executive committees on Jan. 3, Lukashenko mentioned the idea of inviting international observers, saying, &#x201C;We should meet with the Central Commission once again and decide whether we will invite these foreigners (Western observers) to the elections.&#x201D; However, Lukashenko raised the issue less than three weeks before the elections, with the key stages of the campaign &#x2014; the nomination of candidates, the formation of local electoral committees, and the selection of national observers &#x2014; already having been carried out. The rushed presidential election campaign is being held nearly half a year earlier than is stipulated in Belarus&#x2019;s election law. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) cleared the heads of three loyalist parties &#x2014; Aleh Haidukevich, Alexander Hizhnyak, and Siarhei Syrankou &#x2014; along with another sham candidate representing the so-called &#x201C;constructive opposition&#x201D; &#x2014; Hanna Kanapatskaya &#x2014; to &#x201C;challenge&#x201D; Lukashenko for the presidency. As of Jan. 8, the Belarusian Central Electoral Committee (CEC) had accredited 362 foreign observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (PA CSTO) &#x2014; all Russia-led international alliances favoring the Lukashenko regime. Among the 28,330 national observers, 79% come from political parties or pro-government professional unions, the independent news outlet Pozirk reports. Since 2020, Lukashenko has eliminated all but four loyal political parties and liquidated over 1,800 civil society organizations. The expert observation mission organized by the Viasna Human Rights Center and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee claims that the electoral campaign is organized in a &#x201C;repressive climate of threat, fear-mongering, pressure, and persecution in connection with any civil activity unauthorized by the state.&#x201D; Over 13,000 Russian troops will participate in the Zapad-2025 joint military exercise, the Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 10, citing Major General Valery Revenka. Military allies Russia and Belarus have been conducting the Zapad (&#x201C;West&#x201D; in Russian) strategic drills every two years since 2009. Approximately 12,800 Russian soldiers were hosted in Belarus in 2021. Another military drill, &#x201C;Union Resolve 2022,&#x201D; followed the Zapad-2021, and was used to disguise a troop buildup on the Ukrainian border ahead of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. In an interview with a state-owned TV channel, Major General Revenka said that Belarus has already notified OSCE member states about the drills in line with the Vienna Document, extending an invitation to &#x201C;allies, friends, partners&#x201D; to observe the exercises. According to Revenka, Belarus &#x201C;views positively&#x201D; only some EU and NATO member countries &#x2014; without specifying which ones. Noting that Belarus had not been invited to observe European military drills last year, Revenka said that a decision regarding an invitation to NATO members remained to be taken. The date of the Zapad-2025 drills has not officially been announced, but they are believed to be scheduled for September 2025. In October 2024, the Belarusian Air Force announced &#x201C;major drills with Russia in September 2025,&#x201D; right after a meeting of the joint board of the Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministries approved a concept plan for the Zapad-2025 joint strategic exercise. The Vienna Document on security and confidence-building requires its members to provide notification 42 days or more prior to holding military drills. Aside from Zapad-2025, Belarus plans to host three military drills &#x2014; Search, Interaction, and Echelon &#x2014; along with members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Russia-led bloc Moscow set up in 2002, over a decade after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. While not committing Belarusian troops to Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory as a jumping off point for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, provided supplies to the Russian army, and offered to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Minsk City Court has handed down a four-year prison sentence to a local staff member of the European Union&#x2019;s diplomatic service in Belarus, Politico reported on Jan. 9. The sentence, issued in late December 2024, has only now been made public. The court found the EU staffer, Mikalai Khilo, guilty of &#x201C;incitement of hatred and calls for actions harming Belarus&#x2019;s national security.&#x201D; The EU&#x2019;s External Action Service condemned the decision and reiterated calls for Khilo to be released. &#x201C;We continue calling for Mikalai Khilo&#x2019;s immediate and unconditional release,&#x201D; EU spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anitta Hipper said in a statement shared with Politico. The EU diplomatic service previously called for Khilo&#x2019;s release ahead of his trial, which was held on Dec. 23. At the time, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, Petras Au&#x161;trevi&#x10D;ius, told Politico that Minsk was &#x201C;testing the EU&#x201D; by arresting its employee. He said Belarusian diplomats should be expelled from the EU if Khilo was convicted. Forty-one-year-old Khilo split his time between working for the EU diplomatic mission and serving as a preacher in a local Baptist church, as confirmed by CV (formerly known as Christian Vision) &#x2014; an international Christian ministry that monitors the repression of clergy and religious groups. &#xA0; According to an unnamed EU official, Khilo was detained by the Belarusian KGB security service in front of the EU delegation office on April 24, 2024. The Viasna Human Rights Center, a human rights organization based in Belarus, recognizes Khilo as a political prisoner. Although there have recently been eight rounds of pardons of political prisoners in Belarus, 1,240 political prisoners remain behind bars in the country. According to CV, 86 clergymen from various confessions are behind bars because of their public support for anti-government protests in 2020. The number of detected cases of migrants irregularly entering the European Union through its eastern borders more than tripled in 2024, to 17,000, the European border agency Frontex said in a report on Jan. 14. Following the introduction of European sanctions in 2021 over the contested 2020 presidential election and crackdown on dissent, the regime of Lukashenko orchestrated an artificial migration crisis, allowing migrants from the Middle East and African to storm Belarus-EU borders. Frontex preliminary data show that while the overall number of irregular border crossings to the European Union declined by 38% (returning to the post-pandemic level of 2021), the eastern border route (including Belarus and Ukraine) bucked the general trend: There were 17,000 illegal crossings of the bloc&#x2019;s eastern border out of a total of 239,000 crossings recorded in Europe last year.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)In 2021, the EU recorded 8,000 illegal crossings of its eastern border, in what Frontex monitoring described as a &#x201C;hybrid operation targeting the EU external border.&#x201D; Following an initial settlement that led to a decline in the registered irregular border crossings to 5,608 in 2023, the artificial migration crisis reignited again, with Russia joining the effort. In late 2024, the EU authorities revealed that 90% of the migrants arriving via Belarus had Russian student or travel visas. The bloc pledged 170 million euros to its eastern members &#x2014; Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Estonia, and Finland &#x2014; and to Norway to fortify their borders. As &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; involving migrants continues, the border security agencies of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have thwarted a total of 36,291 attempts to illegally cross their borders from Belarus in 2024. In 2024, Poland reimposed a 200-meter-wide buffer zone next to its border with Belarus, and considered temporarily suspending the right to asylum. The Belarusian state-owned TV channel ONT aired on Jan. 14 the first segment of propaganda interviews with journalists held in Belarusian prisons, in an apparent attempt to discredit the work of independent media during the 2020 presidential elections. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, widely viewed as neither free nor fair, the free media field in Belarus was eradicated. Thirty-seven journalists remain behind bars on politically motivated charges, and hundreds were forced into exile. In 2024 alone, 35 independent media were branded as &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and banned in Belarus. The first part of the series &#x201C;about employees of American Media,&#x201D; was filmed in prisons, yet is titled &#x201C;Freedom of Speech.&#x201D; RFE/RL&#x2019;s Belarus Service freelancer and political prisoner Andrey Kuznechyk, who was charged with six years of imprisonment for allegedly &#x201C;creating and participating in an extremist formation.&#x201D; In the interview, Kuznechyk appears in a black robe in the prison yard, looking emaciated. The interviewer urges him to condemn the independent media in Belarus for biased coverage and &#x201C;trying to set Belarus on fire&#x201D; during the 2020 elections. The program is airing ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, the first presidential vote since the contested 2020 race, which is expected to provide Lukashenko with a seventh consecutive term in office. After winning the country&#x2019;s first and last fair election in 1994, Lukashenko remained in power for 30 years, gradually giving up parts of Belarusian sovereignty to Russia. Other segments are to feature RFE/RL Belarus Service journalist Ihar Losik, who has been held incommunicado for nearly two years, as well as former reporter Ihar Karney and opposition activist Yuras Zyankovich, who hold dual citizenship of Belarus and the United States. The international press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) &#xA0;placed Belarus 167th out of 180 countries in its 2024 Press Freedom Index, calling the country the fourth largest jailer of journalists in the world, and Europe&apos;s most dangerous country for journalists up until Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. Political opponents of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko will start accepting applications for the alternative identity documents for exiled Belarusians on Jan. 26, Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has announced on her Telegram channel. In September 2023, Lukashenko barred Belarusian embassies from issuing or renewing passports of Belarusians living abroad, forcing the regime&#x2019;s critics to return to Belarus &#x2014; risking arrest &#x2014; to renew their essential documents. As a result of Lukashenko&#x2019;s move, over 300,000 exiles who have fled Belarus since the contested 2020 elections risk finding themselves in legal limbo, unable to prove their identity, renew residence permits, or access essential services in host countries with expired passports. In response, the Belarusian opposition in exile announced the &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passport project in 2023, but there was little progress on it in 2024. After a change of leadership of the project and a scandal involving the Lithuanian contractor for producing the passports &#x2014; which was found to have ties with the Lukashenko regime &#x2014; the opposition has since produced the first prototypes of the passport. However, the new document has yet to be recognized as suitable for travel or as official proof of identity, and it will initially be available only to EU-based Belarusians due to verification constraints, according to project head Marius Gudelaitis. Franak Viachorka, a chief advisor to Tsikhanouskaya, said that the passports will have &#x201C;specific functionality&#x201D; within a year. &#x201C;Our goal is that this document can replace a foreign passport, be used for travel, and also replace expired (Belarusian) passports when submitting documents for legalization, for example,&#x201D; Viachorka told news outlet Zerkalo. However, the former head of the passport project, Valery Kavaleuski, who earlier resigned from Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s Transitional Cabinet, has warned that gaining recognition for the document under present conditions is unlikely. According to Kavaleuski, the issuing center has had to undergo an independent audit before issuing the documents. Besides, the passport will reportedly use a new country code, instead of the existing Belarusian one, which Kavaleuski described as a &quot;dead end&quot; for the recognition process. The passport will be presented to the public at the &#x201C;Belarusians Deserve Better&#x201D; congress in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 26 &#x2013; the same day as Lukashenko&apos;s latest presidential election, which has been dismissed as a sham by the Belarusian opposition. Meanwhile, Belarusian prosecutors have already issued warnings that congress participants could face criminal prosecution.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-week-belarus-to-host-over-13-000-russian-troops-for-zapad-2025-joint-military-drills/	2025-01-17T07:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2176902499.jpg
Hungary's Orban urges EU to lift Russia sanctions, media reports	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged the European Union to lift sanctions on Russia, news portal Telex reported on Jan. 17. According to the Hungarian outlet, Orban said it&apos;s &quot;time to throw sanctions out the window&quot; and establish a sanctions-free relationship with Russia during a radio interview. He also described the European Union as being in a &quot;drunken stage&quot; but predicted a &quot;sobering up&quot; in Brussels. The statements come as Orban reportedly told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on extending the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly, has repeatedly criticized aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs and escalates the war. &quot;If they hadn&#x2019;t cheated in 2020, Donald Trump would have remained president, and then there would be no Ukrainian-Russian war,&quot; he said, referencing false claims that President Joe Biden stole the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Orban framed peace in Ukraine as essential to Hungary&apos;s economic goals, saying that European perspectives on Ukraine should go beyond the &quot;lens of war.&quot; Orban also announced plans for protective economic measures to &quot;safeguard&quot; Hungarian agricultural sectors, citing Ukraine as a potential economic threat to Europe. Orban&apos;s remarks come amid strained relations between Hungary and the EU. In July, the European Commission criticized Hungary for failing to meet democratic standards, particularly regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence.

How will Russia’s war end?	Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump promised to end the Ukraine-Russia war during his campaign. As inauguration approaches on Jan. 20, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Francis Farrell lays out the four scenarios that could see an end to the war in Ukraine &#x2014; for better or worse.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-will-russias-war-end/	2025-01-17T07:04:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/4-1.jpg
Ukrainian special forces target Russian soldiers behind POW executions — several reportedly killed, captured	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces reported on Jan. 17 that they had located and targeted Russian soldiers responsible for executing two Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). According to the unit, several were killed, and three were captured. The detainees are reportedly providing testimony. The targeted Russian soldiers had allegedly taken two Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces fighters captive days earlier, later executing them on the orders of their company commander, the Special Operations Forces said. The unit conducted an operation to eliminate the group, recover the bodies of the Ukrainian soldiers, and capture any surviving members. The captured Russians were identified as marines from the 40th Arctic Brigade. During interrogations, they allegedly admitted to taking the Ukrainian POWs and executing them under orders. Ukrainian forces reportedly killed three members of the firing squad during the operation, while three others, including one identified by the call sign &quot;Yaryy,&quot; were captured. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of at least 124 Ukrainian POWs, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russian-soldiers-behind-pow-executions-several-killed-captured/	2025-01-17T06:53:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-1_45_03-PM.jpeg
Russia’s seaborne oil exports decline 9.1% in 2024 amid Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reports	Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, reflecting mounting challenges to its fossil fuel industry, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Russian refineries reportedly processed approximately 267 million metric tons of oil in 2024, the lowest since 2012, as rising production costs, falling prices, and an export ban on gasoline strained operations. Exports through Baltic ports fell by 9% to 61.96 million tons, while shipments via Black and Azov Sea ports dropped 10% to 42.75 million tons. Notably, exports from Tuapse plummeted by a third to 9.1 million tons, largely due to drone attacks and operational disruptions at state-owned Rosneft refineries. Exports from Novorossiysk increased by 4% to 19 million tons. Arctic ports, including Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, saw a 14% decline in exports to 1.01 million tons, while Far Eastern ports experienced a 3% drop to 7.97 million tons. Despite the overall annual decline, marine exports of petroleum products rose 10.8% in December to 10.37 million tons. Sanctions from the Biden administration and the U.K., announced on Jan. 10, have further pressured Russia&apos;s oil sector. These measures target nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and associated entities. The sanctions have driven Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. G7 nations are reportedly considering tightening the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-marine-oil-exports-decline-9-1-in-2024-amid-ukraines-attacks-reuters-reports/	2025-01-17T05:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/Rosneft.jpg
Europe needs plans A, B, and C for Trump and Russia	Listening to the confirmation hearings of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s various appointees in Congress this week, it&apos;s becoming clear there is no meaningful grand plan from Trump to end the war in Ukraine quickly. In fact, Trump, along with figures like Keith Kellogg, the incoming Ukraine envoy, has backtracked from claiming the war could be ended in days &#x2014; around the time of the inauguration &#x2014; to acknowledging it may take months. This suggests they are still searching for a strategy. There is a genuine desire to end the war, as Trump says, to &quot;stop the killing&quot; and reduce the U.S. budget burden. For some hardline MAGA China hawks (such as former White House chief strategic Steve Bannon), there&apos;s also a desire to strike a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly in a Nixonian way, realigning for an eventual confrontation with China. These hawks often envision a world where the West and Russia form a Judeo-Christian alliance against China&#x2019;s non-believers. For Trump, the solution seems simplistic: give Putin some &#x201C;wins&#x201D; &#x2014; allowing him to keep the territories he holds, blocking NATO membership for Ukraine, restricting Ukraine&apos;s use of Western long-range missiles, and moderating sanctions. In return, Trump believes Putin would halt the war. The assumption here is that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory would simply be Putin halting offensive military actions. This is naive. It overlooks Ukraine&#x2019;s security, which is central to both its stability and Europe&#x2019;s security. Trump&#x2019;s recent comments about territorial claims on Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal suggest he shares Putin&#x2019;s long-held view that great powers deserve &#x201C;spheres of influence.&#x201D; This could indicate that Trump might even entertain a &quot;Yalta 2&quot; scenario, where Putin gets Ukraine, and Trump gains Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. The question remains &#x2014; would Chinese President Xi Jinping be invited to the table, and what would he get? The issue from the perspective of long-term Putin watchers is that such a deal wouldn&#x2019;t satisfy Putin. He would take everything Trump offers, then push for more. This is the pattern of all Putin&#x2019;s conflicts, from Georgia to Moldova, Ukraine, Syria, and Libya. For Putin, it&#x2019;s not just about territory &#x2014; it&apos;s about eradicating the very system of Western liberal market democracy. Putin&apos;s invasion of Ukraine wasn&#x2019;t about NATO membership &#x2014; an unrealistic prospect in 2014. It was about the threat posed by Ukraine&#x2019;s shift from a Russian client state under then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to a potential member of the Western club of liberal market democracies with the 2013 EU association agreement. Putin feared that if Ukraine succeeded in adopting a democratic, rules-based order, Russians would demand the same, threatening his own rule. It is democracy, not NATO, that Putin despises. He&#x2019;s in an existential battle with the West &#x2014; it&#x2019;s kill or be killed. Trump simply doesn&#x2019;t understand this, or doesn&#x2019;t care. Putin will not stop at a &#x201C;Yalta 2.&#x201D; He seeks total victory over the West. What Trump doesn&#x2019;t grasp is that unless any peace deal ensures Ukraine&#x2019;s security from future attack, Putin will inevitably use any perceived weakness as an excuse for further military invasions. This reality means Ukraine won&#x2019;t receive the investment necessary for its economic development. Without this, Ukraine risks repeating the 22 years of failed economic progress between 1991 and 2013, a period when it remained caught between East and West without a clear anchor, leading to social and political instability.

(Mathilde Kaczkowski /Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images)Ask why Ukraine had two revolutions in 2004-2005 and again in 2014. History will surely repeat itself if millions of soldiers and migrants return to disappointment, leading to further instability that Putin could exploit, either to influence Ukrainian politics or justify future invasions. Trump isn&#x2019;t going to provide the leadership Ukraine or European security needs. Yes, his call for European partners to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP is a bold one, but because Trump will likely fail in his peace plan for Ukraine, Europe must take the lead &#x2014; and perhaps should have done so already. Europe needs Plans A, B, and C. Plan A: Educate Trump about the importance of securing a lasting peace for Ukraine. The pitch to Trump should focus on his aversion to failure. He must be told that if Ukraine lacks the security to fend off Putin, it could collapse entirely. This would be devastating for Europe, as millions of migrants would move westward, destabilizing European economies and their social fabric. A weakened Europe would become a reduced market for U.S. goods and a less valuable long-term ally in the looming battle with China. All this would happen on Trump&#x2019;s watch &#x2014; it would make Biden&#x2019;s failure in Afghanistan look like a sideshow. Plan B: Emphasize how ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s security could benefit the U.S. economy. Ukraine has proven capable of defending itself but could have already won the war with timely, well-supplied Western &#x2014; mainly U.S. &#x2014; military support. NATO membership and bilateral security agreements are desirable but unlikely given the politics. Better for Ukraine to trust in its own defense, provided it is assured the necessary military technology and kit will be delivered. The U.S. defense industry is the only one capable of supplying these. Europe, a $26 trillion economy, is more than capable of funding this effort &#x2014; likely around $150 billion annually, a modest price considering that each 1% increase in NATO spending, due to the Russian threat, costs Europe $250 billion per year. Europe could even fund increased defense spending by unlocking $330 billion in frozen Russian assets, dedicating a significant portion to purchasing U.S. military equipment. Europe should also play to Trump&#x2019;s ego. Pledge a ten-year, $1 trillion European-Ukrainian U.S. defense purchasing program, naming it the &quot;Trump Defense of Democracy in Europe&quot; program &#x2014; a modern-day Marshall Plan. Plan C: Prepare for Trump&#x2019;s potential failure and a bad peace deal that could lead to Ukraine&#x2019;s eventual defeat. If this occurs, Europe must step up financial and arms supplies to Ukraine, buying time to ramp up its own defense capacity to 4-5% of GDP. At the same time, Europe should maintain sanctions against Russia, regardless of U.S. actions. If the U.S. doesn&#x2019;t provide support, Europe should explore diplomatic, economic, and security ties with other powers like Turkey and even China. Though China poses a strategic threat to the U.S., for Europe, Russia remains the primary concern.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-plans-a-b-and-c-for-trump-and-russia/	2025-01-17T05:26:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2179656491.jpg
Slovak opposition leader arrives in Kyiv to 'reopen door Fico slammed'	A Slovak delegation headed by pro-Western opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia party arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 17, he said on social media. &quot;Our goal is clear &#x2014; to reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka wrote, who in turn initiated a confidence vote set for next week. His visit comes days after President Volodymyr Zelensky invited Fico to visit Kyiv on Jan. 17 amid the Slovak prime minister&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Fico said on Jan. 16 he may meet with Zelensky in the &quot;next few days.&quot; According to the opposition leader, the Slovak delegation is planning to hold &quot;important talks&quot; with a Ukrainian side. &quot;Slovakia and Ukraine are close partners and can help each other a great deal,&quot; he said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-leader-arrives-in-kyiv-to-reopen-door-fico-slammed/	2025-01-17T04:54:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-17-140018.png
First Deputy Education and Science Minister: Rebuilding Ukraine, one classroom at a time	The Economist recently reported that Ukraine is winning the economic war against Russia for the first time since the full-scale invasion began. Although the country has yet to return to its pre-war economic levels, the trajectory is promising. To sustain and accelerate this momentum, strategic investments, particularly in education, are crucial. Investments in education have a multiplier effect, acting as a key driver of long-term economic growth. International support for Ukraine&#x2019;s education sector is vital not just for recovery but for the social capital necessary for enduring progress. As Ukraine enters its third year of full-scale war, the education system continues to operate under extraordinary circumstances. At the start of last year, one in seven schools was destroyed or damaged, and over 1.8 million students lost access to in-person education. The true cost, however, goes beyond physical destruction. It includes disrupted learning, emotional tolls on children, and the disconnection of students in occupied territories or abroad. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant strides in restoring education, prioritizing in-person learning where possible. These efforts have been bolstered by a 40% increase in state education funding over the past two years and substantial international support. For the past year and a half, I&#x2019;ve worked at Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Education and Science, promoting what I call &#x201C;educational diplomacy&#x201D; &#x2014; advocating for Ukraine&#x2019;s needs on global platforms and mobilizing resources. Today, 35 countries and more than 80 international organizations are helping support Ukrainian education, including leaders from UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). This international collaboration is delivering tangible results that extend beyond financial contributions, translating into concrete initiatives that impact students and teachers, laying a strong foundation for Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery and future development. In wartime, education &#x2014; a fundamental right &#x2014; is often one of the first casualties. Restoring it requires both innovation and collaboration. For example, the Device Coalition and international partners have provided over 247,990 devices since 2022, particularly to students in front-line and border areas, ensuring access to online learning. Workers clear debris from a school building damaged by a missile attack in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on April 24, 2023, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)Safe in-person learning also depends on the availability of shelters. In response, the Ukrainian government allocated $178 million for the construction of underground schools in 2024, with $147 million more planned for 2025. &#xA0;Together with the support of partners such as the European Union, Belgium, Lithuania, UNESCO, and UNITED24 donors, we will be able to help over 100,000 children return to school. Additionally, the Coalition for Textbooks has distributed more than 7.5 million books to ensure students have the resources to thrive. Key funding initiatives include a $28.2 million collaboration with GPE and a $21 million project with Education Cannot Wait, focused on Ukraine&#x2019;s most affected regions. Looking to the future, Ukraine is aligning its education system with European Union standards and investing in its human capital. For instance, UNICEF is supporting reforms in preschool and inclusive education, while the World Bank has provided unprecedented financial backing for general secondary education. I recall the early days of my tenure when our team traveled to Washington to discuss education funding with the World Bank. What seemed an uphill battle led to the groundbreaking $415 million LEARN project &#x2014; one of the largest in the World Bank&#x2019;s portfolio &#x2014; supporting the New Ukrainian School (NUS) reform and marking the first significant World Bank funding for Ukrainian schools in over a decade. Ukraine&#x2019;s educational transformation extends beyond recovery. By 2027, the country will adopt a European-style 12-year education model. Vocational education is being revitalized with support from Swiss experts and DECIDE, while higher education reform is being advanced through a $200 million program in partnership with the World Bank. Throughout the war, Ukraine continues to develop sustainable educational reforms. A $2.7 million capacity-building grant from GPE is one of the resources enabling these efforts. Building international partnerships is a long and rewarding process. Behind every achievement is a great deal of coordination, advocacy, and collaboration. These partnerships are built on mutual trust, shared vision, and a deep commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Educational diplomacy is a two-way street, and we are committed to being a reliable and innovative partner, sharing our expertise gained through adversity. Ukraine&#x2019;s experience is unique: despite the devastation of war, we are not only restoring education but also laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient future. This progress would not be possible without the collective efforts of the global community. The quality of Ukraine&#x2019;s education system reflects the strength of international cooperation and the shared commitment to achieving sustainable development goals. By investing in Ukrainian education today, we are shaping a brighter future for both our country and the world. To all those who stand with us, I extend my deepest gratitude.

The flaws in Ukraine's new brigades and foreign training programs	Newly formed brigades within the Ukrainian military face critical challenges on the front lines. Poor management, lack of experience, and inadequate training have resulted in territorial losses, damaged equipment, and tragic casualties. NATO&#x2019;s training methods often fail to align with the realities of modern warfare. Despite receiving advanced equipment and personnel, these brigades falter due to weak coordination and leadership. These units lack a solid command and control &#x201C;backbone.&#x201D; Their core comprises reserve officers, officers from non-combat roles, and individuals promoted despite prior underperformance in combat positions. One of the most striking examples is the 155th Mechanized Brigade. Despite receiving modern equipment, training in France, and near full staffing, the unit&#x2019;s command lacked experience and an understanding of combat management, organization, and critical support elements, rendering it ineffective. Over 1,700 soldiers have gone AWOL (absent without leave). These brigades are often redeployed to the front, far from their assigned sectors. After gaining some battlefield experience within &#x201C;established&#x201D; brigades, they are stripped of equipment, weapons, and personnel. I know of approximately 10 such brigades operating under these conditions. Commanders are chosen by military leadership, and Western partners equip these units with advanced weaponry, including armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and tanks. However, most soldiers lack the training to effectively operate this equipment in combat. Instead, experienced specialists in the established brigades, who know how to operate such weapons, are temporarily assigned to infantry roles. Artillerymen, mechanics, anti-tank gunners, and drone operators are placed in infantry positions due to limited expertise elsewhere. New equipment, like Mk 19 grenade launchers and M2 Browning machine guns, replace older systems, like T-64 tanks and AGS-17 grenade launchers &#x2014; but only temporarily. In Europe, soldiers may learn basic skills like shooting rifles and throwing grenades, but this accounts for only 10-15% of what is needed to survive. To endure on the battlefield, an infantryman must know how to camouflage, maneuver, set up positions, counter drones, provide medical aid, conduct surveillance, report accurately, and coordinate with comrades. Trust in leadership, which ensures comprehensive planning and support, is paramount. Unfortunately, such vital training is often neglected abroad and exists in Ukraine only within seasoned units. For example, officers of the 155th Mechanized Brigade were unable to lead troops to positions near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast because their transport lacked a radio-electronic warfare system, leaving them unable to navigate safely. Driving unarmored vehicles to the front is perilous, and even military buses are unsafe just 10 kilometers from the front line. An infantryman typically receives an assault rifle, four magazines, body armor, a helmet, a first aid kit, and a uniform. Yet, survival also requires radios, extra batteries, tablets, additional magazines, grenades, shovels, trench radio-electronic warfare systems, and drones like the Mavic. Volunteers and soldiers&apos; families supply most of these essentials &#x2014; everything except the grenades. Photo for illustrative purposes: A recruit from the 108th Separate Mechanized Battalion &quot;Da Vinci Wolves&quot; trains to operate drones in central Ukraine on March 12, 2024. (Valentyna Polishchuk / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)When a soldier joins a unit equipped with adequate resources and confident leadership, he will do everything to stay. Conversely, soldiers sent to positions immediately after European training or basic military training in Ukraine, without further preparation, often face fatal outcomes or abandon their posts. Time that could have been spent on coordination, adaptation, and effective task distribution was squandered. This failure to prepare has resulted in poorly motivated, untrained soldiers, leading to operational setbacks and heavy casualties. The realities of modern warfare show that foreign training, unless adapted to Ukrainian conditions and integrated with unit practices, is not only ineffective but dangerous. Ironically, our soldiers &#x2014; mechanics, drivers, tankers, artillerymen, grenade launchers, and machine gunners &#x2014; often teach NATO instructors how to operate the equipment provided. All we truly need from our partners is a proper maintenance manual. Substantial reforms are urgently needed in Ukraine&#x2019;s basic combat training. However, no reforms can succeed without commanders who earn the trust of soldiers and volunteers alike. The absence of this trust has led many soldiers to leave struggling brigades in favor of units with better leadership, taking advantage of laws decriminalizing initial desertion. Resources &#x2014; both personnel and equipment &#x2014; must be allocated to units that prioritize the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and deliver results.

According to the governor, the injured are a 22-year-old woman and two men, aged 34 and 56, all of whom are in critical condition. The Ukrainian Air Force had earlier warned of a ballistic threat and detected a high-speed target heading toward the city.

US assured Putin no nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Biden says	The United States assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-assured-putin-no-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-17T03:28:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
There's no evidence that Australian fighter was executed by Russia, prosecutors told media	Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, a Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-evidence-that-australian-volunteer-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-17T02:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins-1.png
Trump has opportunity to 'negotiate a good deal' in Ukraine, Blinken says	The incoming Trump administration will be in a position to broker a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; peace deal in Ukraine, provided that Kyiv agrees, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press briefing on Jan. 16. &quot;So I believe that the incoming administration is in a position where, if the Ukrainians so desire and so choose, it can help to negotiate a good deal,&quot; Blinken said after commenting that thanks to the Biden administration and international partners, Russia has failed to subdue Ukraine. &quot;And President (Donald) Trump talks about having good, strong deals. &#xA0;I think there&#x2019;s an opportunity to get one.&quot; Trump, taking office on Jan. 20, has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might pressure Kyiv toward painful concessions. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though Blinken&apos;s expected successor, Marco Rubio, said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Blinken noted that any potential ceasefire must be enduring and not simply a pause that will give Russian President Vladimir Putin a chance to &quot;rest, refit, and then when he deems the moment right, re-attack.&quot; &quot;So you have to have built into any ceasefire the effective deterrence necessary so that he doesn&#x2019;t re-attack. &#xA0;That is, I think, a necessary part of any good, strong deal for Ukraine,&quot; the chief U.S. diplomat said. The secretary of state also highlighted the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to put Ukraine into the strongest possible position in any peace talks, stressing that Russia suffered massive battlefield losses and faces mounting economic difficulties. &quot;The losses that Russia has incurred are almost unimaginable &#x2013; I think, by some assessments, 700,000-800,000 casualties. &#xA0;That includes those killed and those wounded,&quot; Blinken said. The Biden administration ramped up its support for Ukraine since Trump&apos;s reelection, announcing several major packages of security assistance, easing restrictions on long-range strikes inside Russia, and imposing sweeping sanctions on the Russian energy sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-on-trump-ukraine-deal/	2025-01-17T01:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
Ukraine produced over 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, minister says	Ukraine produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Jan. 16, as unmanned systems become an increasingly vital capability in the war with Russia. The bomber drones were created during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and operate mainly at night. They can also remotely disperse mines or transport ammunition, food, and medicine to Ukrainian positions. Due to their ability to strike at night, Russian soldiers reportedly dub these drones &quot;Baba Yaga,&quot; after a mythical witch. &quot;There are already dozens of bomber drones in Ukraine, and more than 30,000 pieces were produced last year,&quot; Smetanin said. These, as well as several other reconnaissance drones, were presented to President Volodymyr Zelensky and the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the latter&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16. According to Smetanin, Kyiv and London also developed a carrier platform for first-person-view (FPV) drones. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units as of the end of 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produced-over-30-000-bomber-drones-in-2024-minister-says/	2025-01-17T01:23:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-40-22.jpg
Navalny's lawyers sentenced to 3.5-5.5 years in prison	A court in Russia&apos;s Vladimir Oblast sentenced three former lawyers of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny to between three and a half and five and half years in prison, the independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17. Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser, and Igor Sergunin were sentenced after a closed-door trial on &quot;extremism&quot; charges over their involvement with Navalny&apos;s Anti-Corruption Foundation. The foundation was the flagship project of Navalny, Russia&apos;s most known opposition leader, who died under unclear circumstances in a Russian prison colony in February 2024. The news underscores Russia&apos;s increasingly harsh repressions against domestic opposition, which only escalated with the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Extremism&quot; charges are widely seen as a tool to suppress and scare off voices that criticize the current leadership or Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Kobzev was sentenced to five and half years, Liptser to five years, and Sergunin to three and half years in prison. They sare also barred from practicing law for three years after the completion of their prison sentences. The three were detained in October 2023 after being accused of &quot;using their status&quot; as lawyers to facilitate communication between imprisoned Navalny and his organization, labeled as &quot;extremist&quot; by Russian authorities, Meduza reported. Launched in 2011, the Anti-Corruption Foundation has published investigations into suspected corruption among top Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. Russia designated the group as &quot;extremist&quot; and formally dissolved it in 2021. The foundation was relaunched as an international organization the following year. Olga Mikhailova and Alexander Fedolov, two other Navalny&apos;s ex-lawyers charged with &quot;extremism,&quot; have left Russia and are wanted by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s crackdown targets other prominent opposition figures as well. On Jan. 16, Russian law enforcement officers raided the home of oppositionist Illia Yashin&apos;s parents. Yashin was previously sentenced to eight and half years in 2022 for denouncing Russia&apos;s war crimes in Ukraine. He was released during a large-scale prisoner exchange between Moscow and the West in August 2024 and now resides abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalny-lawyers-jailed/	2025-01-17T01:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2170733603.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment in Belgorod Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of the advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read. Ukrainian forces also attacked positions of the radar company of Russia&apos;s radio engineering battalion of the 336th regiment in Belgorod Oblast. &#x421;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x438; &#x423;&#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438; &#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x440;&#x430;&#x434;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x443; &#x442;&#x435;&#x445;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x443; &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x445; &#x43E;&#x43A;&#x443;&#x43F;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x456;&#x432; &#x43D;&#x430; &#x442;&#x435;&#x440;&#x438;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x456;&#x457; &#x411;&#x454;&#x43B;&#x433;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456;. &#x417;&#x430;&#x444;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x441;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x43F;&#x440;&#x438;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x444;&#x443;&#x43D;&#x43A;&#x446;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x440;&#x430;&#x434;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x441;&#x442;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x446;&#x456;&#x457; 92&#x41D;6 &#x437;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x440;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x435;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x43C;&#x43F;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x43A;&#x441;&#x443; &#x421;-400, &#x449;&#x43E; &#x441;&#x432;&#x456;&#x434;&#x447;&#x438;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x43F;&#x440;&#x43E; &#x443;&#x441;&#x43F;&#x456;&#x448;&#x43D;&#x435; &#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x446;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x456;.https://t.co/AAnlwjtCje pic.twitter.com/IzOUGo0NqB Damage to vehicles and equipment was recorded, the military said. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast lies at the border with Ukraine and is regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Ukraine also struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, the General Staff claimed. Also, a drone strike reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast the same night.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russian-radar-equipment-in-belgorod-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-17T00:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1258244285.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 1, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed one person and injured at least 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 33 out of the 50 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Fallen wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy in Kyiv Oblast, said Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration. The debris caused a fire in a cafe and the adjacent boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. Russian drones also targeted port infrastructure near the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The residential building was damaged. No casualties were reported. A Russian Molniya-1 drone hit the roadway in the city of Kharkiv, injuring three men aged 44, 46, and 48, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Five cars were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, three people suffered injuries as a result of a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack, according to the region&apos;s military administration. The attack also damaged an apartment building and a car. Two people were injured in the town of Rodynske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 37 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Seven people were injured over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A Russian drone also attacked a bus stop in the village of Antonivka in Kherson Oblast, killing a man on the morning of Jan. 17, Prokudin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-1-injure-16-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T23:49:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-17_08-33-51.jpg
Allied support for Ukraine won't suddenly change with Trump's inauguration, top NATO officer assures	NATO has taken over some responsibilities in coordinating aid for Ukraine from the U.S. with Washington&apos;s consent, ensuring a stable support mechanism going forward, NATO Military Committee Chief Admiral Rob Bauer said on Jan. 16. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t change on Monday,&quot; Bauer said at a press conference of NATO military chiefs in Brussels, referring to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might reduce military support or push Kyiv toward painful concessions. This led to other partners in the pro-Kyiv coalition preparing mechanisms for stable security assistance for Ukraine should Trump decide to withdraw the U.S. involvement. &quot;The framework after Washington (summit) is to transfer some of the things that were organized by the U.S. now into NATO,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;The SAG-U (Security Assistance Group - Ukraine), the IDCC (International Donor Coordination Center), that was a group of nations helping Ukraine. Now, NATO is taking over that responsibility, and the United States has agreed to that.&quot; These decisions are based on the NATO Washington Summit in July 2024 and were included in its final communique. Bauer said these changes aim to create a stable mechanism to ensure continued support for Ukraine, regardless of political changes. The Dutch admiral added that this is reassuring for Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi &quot;because for him, the war doesn&apos;t change because of what happens in the White House. The war is there (in Ukraine) on Monday as well.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/allied-support-for-ukraine-wont-suddenly-change-with-trumps-inauguration-top-nato-officer-says/	2025-01-16T23:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2095077756.jpg
Italy's upcoming military aid package to Ukraine includes 'modern weaponry,' Umerov says	Ukraine will receive a new military aid package from Italy, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16 after meeting with his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto in Kyiv. &quot;(The military aid package) is already on its way to Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. &quot;This is modern weaponry that will help our soldiers to deliver powerful strikes against the enemy.&quot; The two ministers agreed to strengthen defense cooperation between Kyiv and Rome. The countries also plan to launch joint ventures and other initiatives to support the Ukrainian defense industry. According to Umerov, Crosetto backed the continuation of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meetings, known as the Ramstein format. &quot;This is critical for providing everything our defenders need,&quot; the Ukrainian minister said. Crosetto also met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and discussed security guarantees for Ukraine. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-upcoming-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-includes-modern-weaponry-umerov-says/	2025-01-16T23:08:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-55-42.jpg
German FM slams her government over hesitancy on Ukraine aid	Germany is not currently seen as a &quot;driving force for peace policy in Europe,&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told Politico in comments published on Jan. 17, criticizing her own government for hesitancy in the support of Ukraine. &quot;Even now, during the election campaign, some prioritize a national perspective &#x2014; or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election &#x2014; rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe&#x2019;s peace and freedom,&quot; Baerbock said Her comments come a little over a month before the snap parliamentary elections prompted by the Free Democratic Party (FDP) leaving the governing coalition with Baerbock&apos;s Greens and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democrats (SPD). Foreign policy issues like the Russia-Ukraine war are becoming key topics of the electoral campaign as the parties gear up for the vote on Feb. 23. The conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which has called for more decisive steps in support of Kyiv, is currently leading the polls. Baerbock&apos;s statement also reveals a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Delays in German assistance &quot;means that Ukraine is less able to defend itself and, therefore, less able to defend us,&quot; Baerbock said during a meeting of diplomats in Saudi Arabia last week. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. Scholz&apos;s stance was criticized by the FDP, which claimed that the chancellor initially actively pushed for approving the 3 billion euro package, provided it is paid through borrowing. The opposition by the FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner reportedly led to his dismissal and the coalition&apos;s collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-slams-her-government-over-hesitancy-on-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-16T23:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190247028.jpg

Russian hackers target WhatsApp in new tactic, Microsoft warns	The Russian hacker group Star Blizzard launched a spear phishing campaign in November via the messaging platform WhatsApp, marking a change in longstanding tactics, Microsoft reported in a blog post on Jan. 16. Phishing messages use social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients, exploiting emotions to trick targets into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Star Blizzard sent invitations to join a WhatsApp group to current and former officials in government and diplomacy, international relations and defense researchers, and people and organizations offering assistance to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war, according to Microsoft. This is the first time the hacker group has been observed using this tactic. The shift to WhatsApp may be related to successful cybersecurity efforts exposing Star Blizzard&apos;s techniques, Microsoft said. In the most recent campaign, Star Blizzard hackers impersonated U.S. government officials in emails directing recipients to join a WhatsApp group via QR code. The WhatsApp group claimed to focus on &quot;the latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine NGOs.&quot; The purpose of the campaign was to gain access to targets&apos; WhatsApp accounts and extract their data. While the campaign seemed to subside in late November 2024, Microsoft warned that the shift in tactics signals Star Blizzard&apos;s versatility and &quot;tenacity in continuing spear phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information.&quot; Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-target-whatsapp-in-new-tactic-microsoft-warns/	2025-01-16T21:25:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189475787.jpg
UK to play 'full part' in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, Starmer says	The United Kingdom will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News on Jan. 16. Starmer&apos;s remarks followed his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, where the leaders signed a historic 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K. When asked if the U.K. was prepared to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire, Starmer said he had discussed the matter with Zelensky during his visit. &quot;I&apos;ve been discussing this with a number of allies ... including President Zelensky here today,&quot; Starmer said in an interview with Sky News. &quot;But we will play our full part. We have always been one of the leading countries in relation to the defense of Ukraine, so you can read into that that we will be playing our full part.&quot; Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to discuss the possible peacekeeping mission with Zelensky during his visit. Starmer said he did not want to &quot;get ahead of ourselves&quot; in terms of specific plans but said the U.K. was committed to taking a leading role in ensuring a lasting peace in Ukraine. &quot;Because this isn&apos;t just about sovereignty in Ukraine ... If Russia succeeds in its aggression, it will impact us for a very long time,&quot; he said. London and Paris have already begun discussing the possibility of deploying French and U.K. troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported in December. Starmer on Jan. 16 confirmed that he and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed the issue. The idea of deploying a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as European nations prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump reportedly supports the idea and told Zelensky and Macron during their trilateral meeting on Dec. 7 that he wants European troops to monitor a future ceasefire. Ahead of Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Starmer, the president spoke with Macron on Jan. 14 regarding &quot;practical steps&quot; for implementing such a plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-play-full-part-in-peacekeeping-efforts-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-01-16T19:44:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Zelensky, Italian Defense Minister discuss security guarantees at meeting in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto in Kyiv on Jan. 16 to discuss Italy&apos;s ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. Crosetto&apos;s arrival in Kyiv was announced earlier on Jan. 16, the same day that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Zelensky. Zelensky and Crosetto discussed defense support and security guarantees for Ukraine, the presidential office said. Topics addressed included bolstering air defense systems, training Ukrainian personnel in Italy, and joint defense production. The president highlighted the importance of investing in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, particularly drone production. Ukraine&apos;s future NATO membership as &quot;the most effective&quot; security guarantee possible, one that would advance &quot;a just and lasting peace for all Europe.&quot; The leaders also discussed plans for the Ukraine Recovery Conference, scheduled to take place in Rome July 10-11. Zelensky thanked Crosetto and the Italian government for the country&apos;s 10th military aid package to Ukraine, approved last month. Crosetto said Italy remains committed to supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and that the focus is now on the next round of military aid to Kyiv. &quot;I came here to discuss the 11th support package, as the 10th has already been approved,&quot; Crosetto said. &quot;As we have already discussed, now is the moment &#x2014; perhaps the most critical moment in the past three years &#x2014; to increase support.&quot; Crosetto&apos;s visit comes mere days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The transition of power in Washington is expected to significantly disrupt the balance of Western support for Ukraine amid the full-scale war. European countries are preparing to play a greater role in addressing Ukraine&apos;s defense priorities if the U.S. shifts its focus from aid to negotiations. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-italian-defense-minister-discuss-security-guarantees-at-meeting-in-kyiv/	2025-01-16T18:51:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ItalianDM.jpeg
Russian drone attack in Kyiv Oblast injures child	Russia launched a drone attack against Kyiv Oblast the evening of Jan. 16, causing a fire and injuring a child, Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration, reported. Air defense units intercepted targets over an unnamed town in Kyiv Oblast, Kalashnyk said. Falling wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy. &#xA0; The boy has been hospitalized and is receiving medical attention, Kalashnyk said. No other casualties were reported. The falling debris also caused a fire to break out in a cafe and the attached boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. &#xA0; Russian drone attacks against Kyiv Oblast and the city of Kyiv surged in late fall 2024. Drone strikes have targeted residential areas and critical energy infrastructure in the region. As Moscow intensifies strikes, it also aims to ramp up domestic drone production, with plans to manufacture 6,000 Shahed-style attack drones per year at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-kyiv-oblast-injures-child/	2025-01-16T17:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg
Netherlands announces $27 million in aid for Ukraine following Dutch Foreign Minister's visit to Kyiv	Following his visit to Kyiv, Dutch Foreign Minister Kaspar Veldkamp announced 27 million euros ($27.8 million) in new aid for Ukraine on Jan. 16. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the package includes 7 million euros ($7.2 million) through the Comprehensive Assistance Package, coordinated by NATO, to provide non-lethal support such as fuel, medical supplies, winter equipment, and electronic warfare systems. An additional 20 million euros ($20.6 million) is being allocated to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund to assist with critical infrastructure needs. The announcement came during Veldkamp&#x2019;s meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. In Dec. 2024, The Netherlands pledged a contribution of $23 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and cyber resilience. The country also previously supplied Ukraine with several Patriot air defense launchers, most recently delivering three in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-announces-27-million-in-aid-for-ukraine-following-dutch-foreign-ministers-visit-to-kyiv/	2025-01-16T16:54:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162501104.jpg
Biden administration prioritized sanctions strategies over designating Russia as state sponsor of terrorism, US official says	The Biden administration believes that large-scale sanctions have been more effective politically than designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, Ukrinform reported on Jan. 16, citing U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. &quot;We do not consider this [recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism] to be the most effective way to achieve existing political goals when we talk about Russia,&#x201D; Miller said at a press briefing. He noted that recent US sanctions, including measures targeting Russia&apos;s energy sector, have had tangible effects, such as halting tankers carrying Russian oil worldwide. Miller also said that labeling Russia as a terrorism sponsor could hinder international humanitarian efforts and complicate operations in the region. The latest round of U.S. sanctions was passed on Jan. 15. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-prioritized-sanctions-strategies-over-designating-russia-as-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-us-official-says/	2025-01-16T14:17:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2155312256.jpg
Absurd phenomenon' — The manpower issue threatening to weaken Ukraine's Air Force	Critically lacking manpower on the front lines where Russia continues to use its vast manpower advantage to make grinding advances, Ukraine has been scrambling specialists into the infantry in an effort to replenish losses. Criticized widely by soldiers and experts for a &#x201C;wasteful&#x201D; use of specialist troops that have spent years honing their skills, the short-term solution has frequently led to their death or injury, according to soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent over 2024. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage &#x2014; especially in the infantry &#x2014; while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. The issue of sending specialist troops to infantry units had largely been hidden in the shadows until a video surfaced online on Jan. 14, prompting responses from President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. In the almost three-minute-long video, around a dozen Ukrainian servicemen from the Air Force stand, as one reads aloud a message about what they describe as &#x201C;a real challenge&#x201D; that could &#x201C;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&#x201D; &#x201C;Since 2014, we have been preparing and maintaining the aircraft, ensuring combat missions in the most difficult conditions, both day and night, defending our homeland from the enemy,&#x201D; the speaker of the group &#x2013; all wearing masks &#x2014; says. A Ukrainian Tactical Aviation pilot poses in the cockpit of his MIG-29 fighter jet at sunset in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)The aviation and technical personnel, who say that they have been fulfilling missions on Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets for over a decade, said they received an order to send &quot;almost all technicians to the infantry, which means we will be left without technical personnel to service our aircraft.&quot; The Ukrainian military command was trying to transfer 218 specialists to the infantry when the video was released, and 250 were previously transferred, according to the speaker. &#x201C;The technical staff is actually being destroyed, and without us, the aviation will not be able to function,&#x201D; he says. According to the Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously to the outlet, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. An Air Force serviceman speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Kyiv Independent, painted an even grimmer picture. He said around a couple thousand Air Force servicemen had already been transferred to the infantry since the beginning of the full-scale war, with about 40 % being killed, and 40% wounded in the first days if they were directly sent to the front, while some were still fighting. He added that these are often people who studied for around four years, and further built their knowledge over years of service, stressing the issue dampens morale. In a rare example of a public outcry reaching the Ukrainian authorities, Zelensky on Jan. 14 tried to reassure that such transfers wouldn&#x2019;t be made. &#x201C;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments,&quot; he said in his evening address. &quot;I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2014; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces also insisted on the same day that &quot;there were no plans to transfer the acute shortage of specialists of the Air Force&#x2019;s engineering and aviation service who maintain aircraft to infantry units.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at a press conference during the European Council Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 19, 2024. (Pier Marco Tacca / Getty Images)&#x201C;Instead, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is increasing the number of technical and flight personnel,&#x201D; it added. Acknowledging the &quot;not easy&quot; situation on the front, and that &quot;many areas lack infantrymen,&quot; the General Staff said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. Understanding the complexity of the issue, some soldiers however remain pessimistic about the prospect of possible improvements going forward. The core issue is that no one is bearing responsibility, according to the anonymous Air Force serviceman. He said that the order comes to transfer a certain number from a specialist unit, and the local commander has to pick whom to send, which he said is often difficult because &#x201C;we need everyone&#x201D; and there is no replenishment. &#x201C;Maybe for them (in the military leadership), it&apos;s just a number, not people,&#x201D; the Air Force serviceman said, adding there should be a &#x201C;responsibility and accountability&#x201D; mechanism for the generals making the decisions. Glen Grant, a former British army lieutenant colonel who has advised the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, and closely observes military issues in Ukraine, said that resource management problems persist due to the lack of competent generals, and the inability to learn from mistakes. &#x201C;You just don&apos;t take your technicians and put them into harm&apos;s way because you need them as technicians,&#x201D; the Latvia-based military expert told the Kyiv Independent. A Ukrainian MiG-29 performs a combat mission in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)&#x201C;You may strengthen one area, but then you weaken another area, so the compensation is lost. You&apos;re still back where you are, except you are actually twice worse off because you probably lose the technicians, dead.&#x201D; A couple of recent appointments, such as that of General Mykhailo Drapatyi as the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in November 2024, offers hope, according to Grant, but it is still unclear whether it will be enough to change the overall dynamics of the Ukrainian military leadership. &#x201C;The message is clear that the people don&apos;t value soldier&apos;s lives if they&apos;re going to send them into the front line without being properly trained,&#x201D; Grant said. Ukrainian military expert Mykhailo Zhyrokhov on the other hand said he was skeptical of the number of specialists that the Air Force members said were being transferred to the infantry. He argued that the situation is &#x201C;ambiguous&#x201D; because there is no confirmation that such a number is thrown into the front-line trenches, and he doubts the Ukrainian military leadership would &#x201C;shoot itself in the foot&#x201D; and &#x201C;destroy aviation&#x201D; as has been claimed. &#x201C;It is typical human behavior &#x2014; nobody wants to go to the front, despite the fact that they are professional soldiers, they are contract soldiers, and they have been there all this time, these last twenty years defending the sky,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov told the Kyiv Independent. He also raised questions about how the servicemen obtained the numbers when the information was &#x201C;secret.&#x201D; With the Air Force gradually Westernizing its Soviet-era models of aircraft, there is a surplus of specialists who are only familiar with the older versions who would be sent to the reserves if the country was not at war, according to Zhyrokhov. He said he believed that the surplus, such as the guards based at the airbases, would be sent to non-combat roles as a solution. Mentioning Air Force personnel who fought in hot spots in the east in 2023, such as in the Battle of Bakhmut, Zhyrokhov argued that Air Force servicemen have to immediately get used to the grim realities of the war, just like civilian-turned-soldiers. &#x201C;In wartime, such cases exist, have existed, are present, and will continue to exist,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov said. Ukrainian open-source war monitoring website DeepState, which said that it received a hundred reports from soldiers about the issue concerning the transfer of Air Force and Air Defense specialists to the infantry after the scandal came to light, said that a large number said they received only a few days&#x2019; training before being sent into brigades and &quot;the picture there is not the best.&#x201D; &#x201C;The deliberate sending of specialists who have specific skills, knowledge and experience and their absence directly affects the work of the unit,&#x201D; DeepState said in a Telegram post. Summarizing it an &#x201C;absurd phenomenon,&#x201D; DeepState said the effectiveness of the transfer of specialists to infantry &#x201C;has always been minimal&#x201D; and also resulted in the loss of some servicemen who attained valuable skills abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/absurd-phenomenon-the-manpower-issue-threatening-to-weaken-ukraines-air-force/	2025-01-16T12:12:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1677405750.jpg
NATO deploys Norwegian F-35 fighters for 1st time during Russian Jan. 15 attack on Ukraine	NATO scrambled Norwegian F-35 fighter jets stationed in Poland for the first time to protect airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine on Jan. 15, the NATO Air Command reported on X. Russia attacked Ukraine using cruise and ballistic missiles on Jan. 15, targeting critical infrastructure in several oblasts. Ukrainian forces shot down 30 missiles and 47 drones. &quot;This is the first time the Norwegian jets have scrambled in the active air defense of Polish Airspace, demonstrating Allied commitment to NATO&apos;s eastern flank,&quot; the statement read. Two F-35 fighter jets were involved in the defense of NATO airspace, according to the NATO Air Command. Poland announced on the same day that it was scaling up its air force due to Russia&apos;s mass attack on Ukraine, with additional pairs of fighter jets deployed and ground-based air defense and radar systems on high alert. Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. However, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Most Poles believe the Polish military should shoot down Russian drones that enter Polish airspace during aerial attacks on Ukraine, according to a survey published on Sept. 1 by the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in September that Poland and neighboring countries to Ukraine are &quot;responsible for protecting their own airspace,&quot; despite NATO&apos;s opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-deploys-norwegian-f-35-fighters-for-1st-time-during-russian-jan-15-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-01-16T12:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2173881672.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Key developments on Jan. 16: President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars from strengthening defefense capabilities and supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations to cooperation in trade, energy, and justice and accountability. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; The United Kingdom will also provide new military aid for Ukraine, including 150 artillery barrels, a mobile air defense system, and an expanded training initiative with allied nations, the government announced on Jan. 16. This year, the U.K. plans to deliver unprecedented military support to Ukraine, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. &quot;This funding will not only support Ukraine but also bolster the U.K.&apos;s defense industry, creating jobs across the country,&quot; the statement reads. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26-billion-pound ($2.7 billion) loan, part of the G7 loan program to Kyiv, will also be released for major procurement projects. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets. The military aid includes artillery barrels manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such production in the U.K. in over 20 years. The barrels are expected to be delivered to Ukraine within weeks. The U.K. will also provide a mobile air defense system developed in partnership with Denmark, aimed at enhancing Ukraine&apos;s ability to counter Russian missile and drone attacks. The training initiative builds on the success of Operation Interflex, which has trained over 51,000 Ukrainian recruits in the past two years. The U.K. plans to expand this effort in collaboration with international allies. Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Voronezh Oblast and gunpowder factory in Tambov Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s military said. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, the targeted oil depot stored fuel used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in Russia&apos;s southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukraine out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released. Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade shared a video on Jan. 16 purporting to show the downing of Russian forces&apos; rare reconnaissance drone Merlin-VR. Throughout the full-scale invasion, drones have become pivotal for both Ukraine and Russia, used on and off the battlefield for attack and reconnaissance purposes. &quot;A rare bird was shot down by anti-aircraft gunners and pilots of the 63rd Brigade &#x2014; a Russian experimental Merlin-VR reconnaissance drone,&quot; the brigade&apos;s statement read. The Merlin-VR was shot down by a Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drone. The brigade did not specify where the air battle took place. Russian developers presented the Merlin-VR in 2021, and the Russian army has been using it on the battlefield since 2022. The drone reportedly has a hybrid engine, which reduces its noise while in motion. It can also fly for up to 10 hours and reach altitudes of up to 5 kilometers (3 miles). Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement-ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-depot-gunpower-factory-in-russia/	2025-01-16T11:56:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/c31891f7d5c074d8d496bd47a146d66b_1737036022.jpeg
They are better prepared than Russians' — Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POWs	Editor&apos;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. It was a month-long mission with one primary goal &#x2014; capturing a North Korean soldier alive. One of the biggest obstacles facing the Ukrainian forces tasked with the objective while operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast was overcoming the fanatical, suicidal zeal instilled in Pyongyang&apos;s troops. &quot;(One North Korean soldier) was about to be taken prisoner, but with the words &#x2018;Glory to the Party&apos; or &apos;Glory to Kim Jong-un,&apos; he blew himself up with a grenade,&quot; a Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier with the callsign &quot;Borsuk&quot; told the Kyiv Independent. The mission eventually succeeded earlier this month with the capture of one North Korean soldier by Special Operations Forces and another one by Ukraine&#x2019;s Airborne Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky described their capture as &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war. According to Ukraine, North Korea has deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. &quot;Essentially, this was about conveying to the international community that third countries are indeed involved in this war. And that Russia is not as invincible as they claim,&quot; Borsuk said. The Kyiv Independent got exclusive footage of the mission, as well as interviewed Borsuk and his fellow soldier &quot;Bernard,&quot; who described how they carried out their task, the moment of capture, and why North Korean troops are far more formidable than their Russian counterparts. To prove North Korea&apos;s involvement definitively, capturing one of their soldiers alive was the only option. While Borsuk and Bernard could not disclose details of their preparation, timing, location, or the number of personnel involved in the mission, they revealed they had been monitoring a specific area in Kursk Oblast for an extended period of time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to act. The enemy group operating in the area under surveillance consisted entirely of North Koreans, according to the Ukrainian soldiers. &quot;We approached the target where we were supposed to operate. We had been observing it and knew their base positions were there,&quot; Bernard said. &quot;We started moving, and contact was made.&quot; &#xA0; Screenshot from the video showing the capturing a North Korean soldier. (Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine)A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)In the ensuing firefight, the enemy group took casualties and began to retreat. One wounded North Korean soldier was left behind. &quot;Our guys kept him under constant fire control to ensure he didn&apos;t move or make any sudden moves,&quot; says Borsuk. After approaching his position, disarming him was a delicate and potentially fatal maneuver. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) has previously reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby also earlier echoed these claims, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. &quot;He still had a grenade with him, in addition to his weapon, and it was very difficult to take it away,&quot; Borsuk says, describing the moment caught on headcam footage when they approached the soldier. Eventually, the North Korean soldier allowed them to get close, and they were able to provide him with first aid. Borsuk recalls their prisoner behaving &quot;calmly,&quot; and assessed he was in a stable condition. &quot;He was able to speak. The only issue he had was with his leg; everything else was normal,&quot; he says. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier, callsign &quot;Bernard,&quot; speaks with the Kyiv Independent. (Jason Blevins/The Kyiv Independent)According to Bernard, Russian artillery started firing not long after they reached the North Korean soldier, likely realizing they were trying to take him as a prisoner. &quot;(Russia&apos;s) desire to hide the presence of North Korean units was very great,&quot; Borsuk says. &quot;As (the hits) got closer and closer, he also realized what was happening&#x2026; It was clear from his eyes that he was a human; after all, he wanted to live,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We looked at him. Well, he was just a young guy&#x2026; There were no thoughts, no desire to use physical force, or anything like that,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We simply saved him. And that&apos;s it.&quot; The two captured North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021, while the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer. Both B&#x43E;rsuk and Bernard say there are noticeable differences between the battlefield performance of North Korean and Russian soldiers. &quot;Compared to Russian soldiers, they are much better prepared physically and mentally. They are deliberately trained for where they&apos;re going and what they&apos;ll be doing,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;It&apos;s clear that the Russians don&apos;t push themselves as hard as they do. They (North Korean soldiers) can carry heavy loads, run for long distances, and survive much better in extreme conditions.&quot; Bernard suggests they are better prepared thanks to their eight-year-long military service. However, when it comes to more &quot;complex maneuvers,&quot; the North Korean soldiers struggle to execute them effectively, he adds. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;Here, they can&apos;t apply everything they were trained for because the war is not the same as what they were told, or shown it would be,&quot; says Bernard. According to Bernard, North Koreans appear to be struggling to adapt to drones and aerial reconnaissance, both of which play a dominant role on the modern battlefield. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service has previously claimed that at least 300 North Korean soldiers had been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, attributing their high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &#x201C;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The SBU said that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Borsuk believes that the ratio of killed to wounded among North Koreans is actually quite different. &quot;They have many more killed,&quot; he says, adding their coordination with the Russian units is &quot;clearly poor,&quot; partially because of the language barrier. However, the North Korean soldiers also appear to be more motivated and resilient than the Russian troops, according to Bernard. &quot;They seem very committed to their ideology. That&apos;s why they are true to their norms and what they were told about who they are and what they should do. And they simply can&apos;t do it any other way,&quot; he says. While Western officials including outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have described Russia&apos;s use of North Korean troops as an indication of Moscow&apos;s &quot;growing desperation,&quot; Borsuk says their use could potentially shift the dynamics of the war. &quot;Imagine a battalion facing a force of up to 10,000 troops,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;They can throw battalion after battalion into the fight, and they&apos;re not running out of personnel.&quot; This relentless tactic strains both Ukrainian soldiers and logistical support, as significant resources are required to counter such waves, according to Borsuk. &quot;These actions usually bring minimal results. However, it&apos;s not ruled out that they could deploy a larger number of troops,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, they come, die, and that&apos;s it,&quot; says Bernard. &quot;It&apos;s just that, perhaps, we should be doing a slightly different job, but instead, we&apos;re focused on eliminating them.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/they-are-better-prepared-than-russians-ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pows/	2025-01-16T11:13:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/v2_00_04_47_15_Still001.png
Fico may meet with Zelensky in 'next few days'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the &quot;next few days,&quot; he told journalists on Jan. 16, iRozhlas reported. &quot;We are looking for another date, which should be in the next few days,&quot; Fico said when asked about a potential meeting with Zelensky. Fico did not specify where the meeting might take place. Fico had earlier offered Zelensky a meeting at the Slovak-Ukrainian border to discuss Ukraine&apos;s decision to end Russian gas transit through Ukraine. In response, the Ukrainian president invited the Slovak prime minister to Kyiv. Following Zelensky&apos;s invitation, Tibor Gaspar, deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, said that Fico would not be visiting the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces repel Russian assault on border with Russia's Kursk Oblast, military says	The 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade repelled an assault of Russian troops near the village of Zhuravka in Sumy Oblast on the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, according to the brigade&apos;s Jan. 15 statement. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast &#x2014; the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. Russia has amassed troops along the border near Zhuravka and tried to assault the settlement but has so far failed, according to the brigade. &quot;The enemy is expected to repeat the movements, as they have resources there,&quot; the statement read.

Sumy Oblast authorities, including head of the Military Administration Volodymyr Artyukh, rejected the notion that Russian forces had breached the border, calling the reports &quot;fake&quot; and describing them as disinformation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-repel-russian-assault-on-border-with-russias-kursk-oblast-military-says/	2025-01-16T10:23:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190374520.jpg
Partners, not allies: What to expect from Russia-Iran agreement set to be signed on Jan. 17	For Moscow, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17 is a diplomatic victory. The trip&apos;s centerpiece will be the finalization of a long-heralded partnership deal between Russia and Iran, signed by Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. The agreement is the latest chapter in Moscow&apos;s ongoing efforts to seek out global allies and acceptance amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Pezeshkian and Putin will use their Moscow meeting to discuss greater cooperation in trade, transport, and logistics, as well as &quot;acute issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the Kremlin said on Monday. But it is the prospect of greater military cooperation between the two countries that most concern onlookers. Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has already prompted closer ties: Moscow&apos;s troops use Iranian Shahed-type drones to bombard Ukrainian cities, while Tehran has been accused by the U.S. of giving Russia close-range ballistic missiles. Iranian officials deny the allegations. The new agreement highlights this growing military exchange. But it also comes at a time when the balance of power between Russia and Iran has shifted. Since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Moscow has always held the upper hand in negotiations with Tehran. But Russia&apos;s need for arms and allies gives Iran new leverage in a changing partnership &#x2014; one that both sides hope will give them an edge. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 left Moscow isolated on the world stage and targeted by bruising Western sanctions. Iran has been a helpful example for Russian officials on how to navigate this strange new world. Having survived for decades under its own barrage of sanctions, Iran has also been able to act as a template for Moscow. Cornerstone sanctions-busting tactics, such as using a shadow fleet of tankers to transport sanctioned oil, have been used for years by Iranian officials. Moscow has been able to adopt such templates to great effect. Their own sanctioned status also means that Iranian officials are happy to ignore Western bans on Russian trade. After almost three years of war, equipping Russia&apos;s troops in Ukraine remains a priority for the Kremlin. Iranian weapon systems are cheap and easy to make, ideal for a conflict that has seen Moscow&apos;s forces bogged down on the battlefield. An Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Shahed-136, is being displayed at the Azadi (Freedom) Square during a rally in western Tehran, Iran, on Feb. 11, 2024. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;Iranian weapon systems are not advanced like Western or even Russian weapon systems &#x2014; but they work, and they work very effectively,&quot; says Sina Azodi, a visiting scholar and lecturer at the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University. &quot;After Western sanctions on Russia that cut off the country&apos;s access to advanced microchips, the Russians learned that these more simple weapons systems would work in their favor.&quot; But it&apos;s not only Moscow that needs military technology. It&apos;s likely that Tehran also wants modern Russian weapons: something that has become particularly pressing after Israeli strikes on Iran&apos;s air defence installations in October. &quot;Iran needs a modern air force. Iran needs a modern air defense system,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia is the only country that can &#x2014; and is willing &#x2014; to provide that to Iran.&quot; There is no guarantee, however, that once such promises are made that either partner will be able to deliver. Reports have repeatedly surfaced in recent years on Iran&apos;s alleged purchase of Russian Sukhoi fighter jets &#x2014; but the planes themselves have not appeared, suggesting that such deals have not been successful. While Iran&apos;s increased leverage in Moscow could help such acquisitions become a reality, the Kremlin also has other priorities to protect. &quot;Iran desperately needs a replacement for its air defense systems that the Israelis destroyed,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;But the question is whether Russia can provide it, given that it needs air defenses for its own war in Ukraine.&quot; There are also other potential sticking points between the two sides. With Moscow and Tehran both under heavy sanctions, both countries are now competing to sell goods such as oil on the same grey market. While Iran may have a longer history of using shadow tankers, ultimately, Russia&apos;s economic clout has allowed it to undercut its rivals on price. &quot;Russia and Iran have been drawn into a battle on providing discounts for oil buyers in countries such as China and India,&quot; says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute and a faculty member at the University of South Florida. &quot;But some of these discounts are so heavy that it&apos;s very difficult for Iran to beat.&quot; A general view of the Guwahati Refinery operated by Indian Oil Corporation in Guwahati, India, on March 30, 2023.

(Biju Boro / AFP via Getty Images)There are also ongoing geopolitical disagreements and rivalries. The fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria is a fresh wound for both Iran and Russia: in a recording that surfaced in the Iranian media in early January, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Behrouz Esbati accused Moscow of failing Tehran by allowing Israeli strikes on Iranian assets in Syria. He also said that the Kremlin had misled Iranian officials by claiming to strike rebel forces while, in fact, bombing empty fields. The tussle between Iranian and Russian influence in the Caucasus remains another sensitive topic. In September, Iran warned Moscow against siding with Azerbaijan in an ongoing dispute between Baku and neighboring Armenia on the placement of a land corridor to Azerbaijan&apos;s Nakhchivan enclave. &quot;Any threat from north, south, east, or west to territorial integrity of our neighbors or redrawing of boundaries is totally unacceptable and a red line for Iran,&quot; Iranian Foreign Minister Sayeed Abbas Araghchi wrote on X at the time. However, such issues can be pushed aside as both sides react to changing political tides. For now, both can use their shared agreement to push back against a common foe &#x2014; the United States. &quot;Iran sees Russia as a powerful partner to force the United States out of the Middle East. They see the United States as the main obstacle in expanding their own influence in the region,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia, obviously, is a very good partner because they want the same thing.&quot; The imminent inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump will be felt keenly in both Moscow and Tehran. For Iranian officials, Trump&apos;s president comes with a sense of trepidation. Trump has consistently advocated for a harder line on Iran, as have many among his advisors. As his second term looms, it is natural for Iran to seek refuge among powers such as Russia and China, says Mahmoudian. Moscow will also be trying to make its own impression on the White House.

(Win McNamee / Getty Images)&quot;Russia wants to send a signal to the White House: we still can make things worse for you,&quot; says Mahmoudian. &quot;(The agreement signals), &apos;we understand that you are trying to take a harsher stand against Iran, but it&apos;s going to be very hard without having us on board.&quot; Yet while closer Iranian-Russia ties currently aid both countries on the global stage, this agreement could also be easily shed as world events shift. If Moscow begins peace negotiations with Ukraine, then it may distance itself from Tehran in order to win favors in Washington. &quot;Russia&apos;s top foreign policy issue is Ukraine. They want to make a favorable deal. And for that, they need to make an agreement with the Americans as Ukraine&apos;s top backers. Russia is not going to, in my view, risk or jeopardize such a deal over Iran,&quot; says Mahmoudian. Ultimately, it is these external considerations that undermine the long-term effectiveness of the Russia-Iran deal. &quot;An agreement can be game-changing or influential, but not if it&apos;s at the mercy of another third party,&quot; Mahmoudian says. &quot;The destiny of this agreement and its survival is at the mercy of the White House and the new administration.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/for-moscow-iranian-president-masoud-pezeshkians-visit-to-russia-on-jan-17-is-a-diplomatic-victory/	2025-01-16T09:29:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2177151725.jpg
Ukrainian military releases footage of rare Russian reconnaissance drone downing	The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade shared a video on Jan. 16 purporting to show the downing of Russian forces&apos; rare reconnaissance drone Merlin-VR. Throughout the full-scale invasion, drones have become pivotal for both Ukraine and Russia, used on and off the battlefield for attack and reconnaissance purposes. &quot;A rare bird was shot down by anti-aircraft gunners and pilots of the 63rd Brigade &#x2014; a Russian experimental Merlin-VR reconnaissance drone,&quot; the brigade&apos;s statement read.

The drone reportedly has a hybrid engine, which reduces its noise while in motion. It can also fly for up to 10 hours and reach altitudes of up to 5 kilometers (3 miles). Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-releases-footage-of-shooting-down-rare-russian-reconnaissance-drone/	2025-01-16T08:55:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-16-at-18_33_56.png
How Trump could use sanctions in negotiations with Russia	In the run-up to his departure from the White House, President Joe Biden has slapped a number of major new sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s financial systems and energy sector. The U.S. originally threatened Russia with &#x201C;the mother of all sanctions&#x201D; as Moscow prepared to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, Washington and its allies have gone after tens of thousands of Russian citizens and companies in a bid to eat away Russia&#x2019;s economy and stifle its war machine. The effects of the sanctions have taken time to kick in while Russia has managed to circumvent the bans, particularly on its energy sector. But proponents of sanctions say they are a crucial tool in the economic war with Moscow and point to Russia&#x2019;s stuttering economy as an example. They have also gotten under the skin of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tried to get grain and fertilizer sanctions lifted by offering to revive the failed Black Sea grain deal in September 2023, to no avail. Ships, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline in Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 2, 2022. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)In less than a week, President-elect Donald Trump will take over from Biden, casting uncertainty over the future of the sanctions. Trump has not yet indicated what he will do with the sanctions. He could lift certain sanctions, impose more, or simply leave everything as it is. Experts agree, however, that Trump will follow the proposal of Keith Kellog, Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine envoy who has suggested offering Russia sanctions relief as part of potential peace agreements. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are currently preparing a sanctions strategy to pressure Moscow toward a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16.But any change in the sanctions regime by Washington without proper coordination with allies like the U.K. and EU could undermine their efforts to contain Russia and wind up strengthening Moscow, experts say. &#x201C;If some major energy sanctions are lifted, Russia gains revenues and improves its financial situation and starts accumulating money again to produce missiles and weapons,&#x201D; said Yuliya Pavytska, the manager of the sanctions program at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). Trump will not be able to wipe away all the sanctions imposed on Russia on his first day in office. The Russian sanctions fall into two camps: executive, which the president has the power to impose or repeal on his own, and statutory, which requires going through Congress. The easiest sanctions for Trump to lift will be those implemented under Biden&#x2019;s executive order, says Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. These include travel bans, asset freezes, the oil price cap, bans on new investments in Russia, as well as bans on imports and exports of non-essential Russian goods like vodka and seafood. &#x201C;(Trump) could also lift technology export controls, which would be a pretty big deal because a lot of (U.S.) microchips find their way into Russian missiles,&#x201D; Ziskina added. The statutory orders require a back-and-forth between Trump and Congress. Trump would have to make determinations to Congress to get approval followed by a review period where Congress can issue a joint disapproval if they want the sanctions to remain which in turn can be vetoed by Trump. But Trump&#x2019;s veto could be overruled by Congress with a two-thirds majority. Congressional approval will be needed if Trump wants to lift the REPO Act, which greenlights the confiscation of the roughly $4-5 billion in frozen Russian assets in the U.S, as well as sanctions imposed under the 2017 Countering America&apos;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Trump&#x2019;s main goal will be to negotiate from a position of strength, said Steven Moore, a former chief of staff in the U.S. House of Representatives and founder of Ukraine Freedom Project, an NGO. He thinks Trump could tighten up sanctions and step up enforcement to plug the loopholes. &#x201C;Trump would be better served focusing on sanctions enforcement in the first year of his term to create some pain to which Vladimir Putin might be receptive to ending,&#x201D; he said. One of the glaring issues is Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet which negates oil and gas sanctions through a network of hundreds of tankers. Biden cracked down on the fleet last week, imposing sanctions on 183 tankers, two dodgy insurance companies, and major oil producers Gazprom Neft, which is a subsidiary of state-energy giant Gazprom, and Surgutneftegas.

(Mikhail Metzel / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Both companies produce over 1 million barrels of oil a day and make an estimated $23 billion a year, according to the U.S. Treasury. Biden&#x2019;s recent actions also include sanctions on Gazprom Bank and 50 other banks in November 2024. Most recently on Jan. 15, he imposed sanctions and secondary sanctions on 150 Russian and non-Russian financial institutions, energy companies, enterprises supporting the Russian military, and entities involved in sanctions evasion, particularly in China. These actions could be part of the outgoing administration&#x2019;s plan to &#x201C;amass bargaining chips&#x201D; for the next administration when Trump takes over, said Taisa Markus, adjunct professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and visiting professor at Kyiv Mohyla Faculty of Law. &#x201C;Some of these new sanctions can be lifted unilaterally by a president. Others require going to Congress perhaps revealing some desire on the part of the Biden administration to ensure the incoming administration keeps up pressure on Russia,&#x201D; she said. &#xA0; &#x201C;Or if Putin doesn&apos;t do what Trump wants, Trump can sanction more. Under existing authority, there is a lot more a President can do in terms of imposing sanctions or enforcement without going to Congress,&#x201D; Markus added. Trump&#x2019;s team has shared differing views on sanctions, which could impact his decision-making. Vice President-elect JD Vance brushed off the Russian sanctions, saying they have &#x201C;gone off like a wet firecracker&#x201D; and objected to the Repo Act believing it limits the president&#x2019;s political power.Marco Rubio, Trump&#x2019;s pick for Secretary of State, backed the idea of using sanctions as leverage over Russia. &#x201C;(Sanctions) will have to be part of this conversation in terms of bringing about a peaceful resolution,&#x201D; he said, CNN reported on Jan 15. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are in the early stages of preparing a sanctions strategy, Bloomberg reported, citing sources close to the matter. This could include some relief for sanctioned oil producers if a peace deal looks likely or expanding sanctions to bolster Washington&#x2019;s position. Sanctions are only one tool in the West&#x2019;s economic war, said Moore. He thinks Trump will ramp up energy production in the U.S. and increase liquified natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe to relinquish Russia&#x2019;s grip on Europe&#x2019;s LNG market and drive down Russian prices. Trump could also broker a deal with Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil following Riyad&#x2019;s decision to hike production last October which would further hinder Russia&#x2019;s economy. The fossil fuel is Russia&#x2019;s lifeline and it earned 12.4 billion euros ($12.6 billion) from oil exports in December alone, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). &#x201C;Anything that can increase economic pressure is something that may keep Russia from being able to fight. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for,&#x201D; Moore said. Lifting sanctions does not appeal to everyone, particularly in Ukraine, largely due to distrust of Putin to keep his word. In Congress, opinions are split with pro-Ukrainian politicians less likely to back lifting sanctions. &#x201C;There&apos;s a very strong argument for keeping the sanctions in place long after a peace agreement to ensure compliance,&#x201D; Markus said. Lifting sanctions means that Russia will be able to expand its revenue streams again. If Putin agrees to a ceasefire, he could bolster Russia&#x2019;s economy and war machine and attack again if there are no security guarantees in place for Ukraine, like NATO membership. &#x201C;There has to be something very big from Putin&apos;s side, like fully getting out of Ukraine. (Lifting sanctions) is definitely not worth a ceasefire, as Putin won&#x2019;t follow it,&#x201D; said KSE&#x2019;s Pavytska.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)The consequences could be dire if Trump doesn&#x2019;t act in coordination with other partners, particularly Europe. Since the sanctions are designed to work in tandem with each other, lifting U.S. sanctions would undermine European efforts and alleviate the economic burden on Russia. This could force the EU and U.K. to bear greater responsibility and step up on their own, said Pavytska. Or it could erode unity between Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &#x201C;&#x200A;If the U.S. is seen as regaining access to Russia&apos;s market while Europeans keep their sanctions in place and their companies don&apos;t get access to that market, they&apos;re at a competitive edge,&#x201D; said Ziskina. This may aggravate tension within Europe and embolden anti-Ukrainian factions within the EU like Hungary and Slovakia to push for sanction relief, she added. In general, Congress looks at sanctions favorably as they are perceived as costing the U.S. &#x201C;nothing,&#x201D; Ziskina said. Trump&#x2019;s administration will look at sanctions through the eyes of U.S. interests and what&#x2019;s best for them. &#x201C;It&apos;s not necessarily about helping Ukraine,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s more support for sanctions within Congress than there is for allocating a budget to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&#x201D; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/heres-what-trump-could-do-with-russian-sanctions/	2025-01-16T08:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Trump advisers draft sanctions plan to pressure Moscow toward peace, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are developing a comprehensive sanctions strategy aimed at facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. This comes as Russia&apos;s fossil fuel industry continues to serve as a primary source of funding for its war against Ukraine. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow. Trump&apos;s team is also evaluating sanctions policy options to put pressure on Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported. The strategy is in its early stages and ultimately depends on what Trump decides to do, the people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. The G7 nations are also considering tightening the existing $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production through targeted drone strikes on key infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reportedly reduced or suspended operations due to the combined effects of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-advisers-draft-sanctions-plan-to-pressure-moscow-toward-peace-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-16T07:21:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
UK announces new $2.6 billion aid package to Ukraine	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a new military aid package worth $2.6 billion for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, European Pravda reported. This visit marks Starmer&apos;s second trip to the Ukrainian capital and the first since becoming prime minister in July 2024. During the visit, Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 100-year partnership agreement to solidify long-term cooperation. Starmer revealed that the U.K. has already provided 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine this year and pledged an additional 2.2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The prime minister said that separate from the new aid package, the U.K. would send Ukraine 150 artillery barrels produced by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such barrels manufactured in the U.K. in over two decades. &quot;They will start arriving in Ukraine in a few weeks,&quot; Starmer said at a press conference. The prime minister also announced the delivery of a mobile air defense system developed in collaboration with Denmark, signaling ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense capabilities. In the days leading up to Starmer&apos;s visit, Bloomberg reported that Starmer and Zelensky were set to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to Ukraine during the trip.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-send-ukraine-artillery-barrels-air-defense-system-as-part-of-2-6b-package-funded-by-russian-assets/	2025-01-16T06:22:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia learn modern warfare — albeit at heavy cost	Since December, North Korean troops have been taking part in active combat on Russia&apos;s side in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine has held territory since August. This unprecedented move, made against the backdrop of a deepening Moscow-Pyongyang alliance, provided some insight into how North Korean troops fare in modern warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9 that North Korea had suffered 4,000 soldiers killed or wounded while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. A week later, South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency placed North Korean losses at 300 killed and 2,700 injured. Though these claims cannot be independently verified, experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent for this article believe the figures to be credible. This means that up to one-third of the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent sent to aid Russia&apos;s war have been killed or injured. But despite gaps in knowledge and experience, observers acknowledge that the North Koreans have proven to be committed, even fanatical fighters. As a testament of their will to fight and die in war a continent away, Ukraine has so far managed to capture only two North Korean soldiers &#x2014; the others reportedly commit suicide or are killed by their comrades to avoid falling into captivity. A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)What&apos;s behind North Korean losses?Though Ukraine reported the first limited clashes with North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast in early November 2024, full-fledged combat deployment in ground assaults can be traced to mid-December. North Korean soldiers have joined Russian efforts in retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. Since then, Kyiv&apos;s forces began churning out footage of North Korean soldiers being hunted down by FPV drones or killed by Ukrainian fire as reports of casualties mounted. Despite the training and equipment Russia provided to its new allies, North Korean troops proved ill-prepared for the realities of modern warfare, lacking the experience of their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. &quot;North Korean troops are being &apos;consumed&apos; for front-line assaults in an unfamiliar battlefield environment of open fields, and they lack the ability to respond to drone attacks,&quot; said a South Korean official briefed by his country&apos;s intelligence agency in December. The high casualty rates can also be attributed to the &quot;human wave&quot; tactic mirroring Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine as North Korean soldiers are funneled against fortified Ukrainian defenses. The battlefield environment in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has been especially deadly, with Russia itself suffering between 600,000-800,000 casualties throughout the full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian sources. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, defense expert Viktor Kevliuk said that the purpose of the North Korean contingent is to &quot;solve tactical tasks that involve a high level of losses.&quot; Similarly, White House spokesperson John Kirby noted that North Korea employs &quot;massed dismounted assaults&quot; which &quot;haven&apos;t really been that effective&quot; and result in &quot;heavy casualties.&quot; &quot;At night, small, overstretched groups (10-15 soldiers) come in, accumulate, and then enter the village from different directions,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier fighting near Sudzha told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 6, confirming that North Korean assaults resemble the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics.

(Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)&quot;I think these columns are entirely Koreans, they come in, and then they are replaced by Russians already in the positions they occupy.&quot; Sydney Seiler, a senior advisor at the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and former U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;cards (have been) stacked against&quot; North Korean soldiers from the beginning. &quot;And when you throw on top of that command and control language differences and just the fact that this is high casualty warfare,&quot; the current casualty rates are to be expected, the expert said. Western and Ukrainian officials nevertheless acknowledged that the &quot;indoctrinated&quot; North Korean soldiers, including elite &quot;Storm Corps&quot; units, showed high resolve and continued attacking no matter the casualties or chances of success. South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency recently said that the North Korean soldiers chose suicide rather than falling into captivity, ramping up the losses even further. A video published by Special Operations Forces of Ukraine on Jan. 13, showed Ukrainian troops taking part in active combat with allegedly North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. In one instance, the video captures a soldier fighting against Ukrainian troops committing suicide. While the deployment of North Korean soldiers is mutually beneficial to both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, The New York Times reported that the idea came from Pyongyang. North Korea receives not only assistance for its nuclear weapons program, hard cash, and other tangible benefits but also valuable military experience. The threat of the North Korean regime acquiring a battle-hardened force adept at modern warfare has indeed become a cause for concern both in Seoul and Washington. Pyongyang &quot;is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology, and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,&quot; said Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Special Operations Forces shared an alleged excerpt from a diary of a killed North Korean soldier that seems to confirm these concerns. &quot;I emphasize once again that the most important, vital task for our Armed Forces is readiness in the event of war,&quot; the diary reads. The goal of North Korea&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war is &quot;to prepare versatile battalions that can perform any task perfectly, even at the cost of death.&quot; Indeed, it appears that the North Koreans are learning their lesson &#x2014; albeit the hard way.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;There&apos;s evidence that they&apos;re (North Korean troops) starting to learn how to use soldiers as decoys for drones while others shoot them down,&quot; Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and non-resident fellow at the CSIS, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a long, slow learning process for them, but they will learn &#x2014; those who survive &#x2014; and they&apos;ll pass those lessons on to subsequent deployments to Kursk and to their military back home in North Korea.&quot; Seiler told the Kyiv Independent that North Koreans &quot;probably engaged in military actions that are relatively simple in their complexity and become highly repetitive.&quot; &quot;They&apos;ve overcome the shock of the sudden deployment,&quot; he added. The expert nevertheless voiced skepticism about the usefulness of the gained experience unless North Korea dispatches a larger contingent. &quot;I don&apos;t really believe that unless this is a protracted contribution of troops somewhere up towards 100,000 or more (who) get experience&#x2026; that that&apos;s going to be a big payoff,&quot; Seiler said. There are signals that the initial 12,000-strong contingent might not be the last batch of reinforcements Moscow receives. Speaking to U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelensky said that North Korea could dispatch an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front as Russia ramps up pressure in Kursk Oblast. On Russia&apos;s part, North Korean troops can help beef up the front in Kursk Oblast while experienced Russian forces continue pushing forward in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The North Korean contingent is a discount way to increase the density of&#x2026; (Russia&apos;s) battle formations in the Kursk region,&quot; Kevliuk said, acknowledging that they are &quot;useful in this context.&quot; Putin is likely to try and squeeze Ukraine out of his home turf before Kyiv can leverage its positions there in possible peace talks this year. Russia has been steadily chipping away at Ukrainian gains in its southwestern region for the past months. A recent Ukrainian offensive appeared to have achieved only limited gains so far rather than turning the tide. As for North Korea, experts concur that both tangible and intangible benefits the country&apos;s regime receives outweigh any potential losses. &quot;Whether it&apos;s broader lessons from the war about drones and air defense, strategic coercion, information operations, whether it&apos;s about access to new technologies for its missiles and these kinds of things, there will be other kinds of returns that North Korean will be expecting,&quot; Ryan said. According to Seiler, Kim Jong Un&apos;s ambition to &quot;show himself as a leader among this new axis of upheaval&quot; and gain diplomatic benefits from his partners could be even more important than any potential battlefield experience. Western officials have warned that North Korea could grow bolder should Ukraine be defeated, with potential repercussions for the security in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region at large.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-troops-learn-the-lessons-of-russias-war-albeit-at-heavy-cost/	2025-01-16T05:57:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg
Russian drone flew over presidential palace during Zelensky-Starmer meeting, Guardian reports	A Russian drone flew over the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv as President Volodymyr Zelensky was meeting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16, The Guardian reported. The drone incursion came as Starmer arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital on his first visit since taking office. Explosions were heard in downtown Kyiv around 12:20 p.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent reporters. Air defense was trying to shoot down a drone as two leaders held talks, The Guardian reported. The drone was spotted and heard buzzing above the Mariinsky Palace, the presidential residence, located not far from the Presidential Office. Zelensky and Starmer held a press conference there later the same day. The unmanned aerial vehicle spotted above the palace may have been a decoy, according to The Guardian. Kyiv and London signed a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty covering a number of areas, including defense, energy, trade, culture, and other sectors. &quot;We will send greetings (to Russia) too,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference when asked about the recent Russian drone attack, Interfax-Ukraine reported. Debris from downed Russian drones fell in five districts of Kyiv, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city&apos;s military administration. No casualties or fires were reported. The Pecherskyi district, where the Presidential Office is located, came under a Russian drone attack also on the morning of Jan. 1. Two people, a couple of prominent scientists, were killed, and six others were injured.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-flew-over-presidential-palace-during-zelensky-starmer-meeting-guardian-reports/	2025-01-16T05:56:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577080.jpg
Ukrainian families of war victims can now seek compensation through The Hague's Register of Damage	The International Register of Damage for Ukraine has begun accepting applications for compensation from families who lost close relatives due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on Jan. 16. The application process for this category was delayed after a December 2024 cyberattack on Ukrainian state registers, according to a statement on the register&apos;s website. The Hague-based Register of Damage was established under the auspices of the Council of Europe in accordance with a U.N. General Assembly resolution. It marked the first step toward creating a mechanism to ensure compensation for those who suffered from the war. Claims can now be submitted for over 40 categories of harm, including deaths, torture, sexual violence, bodily harm, forced displacement, property loss, damage to infrastructure, harm to cultural and historical heritage, and environmental destruction. Ukrainians can also provide evidence of damage to or destruction of their properties, including houses and apartments. The World Bank estimates Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery and reconstruction costs at $486 billion over a 10-year period. Meanwhile, approximately $300 billion of Russian Central Bank assets remain frozen in the West. The G7 nations pledged in October 2023 to keep these assets frozen until Moscow pays reparations to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-war-victims-can-now-seek-compensation-through-ukraines-register-of-damage/	2025-01-16T05:44:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_008.jpeg
Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars: &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; Starmer&apos;s visit marks his second to the Ukrainian capital and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. It comes as the U.K. reportedly discusses deploying an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country after a potential ceasefire. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv to discuss the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment with Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-16T05:17:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops to join Russia’s Victory Day for the first time, media reports	North Korean soldiers will participate in Russia&#x2019;s Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, marking the first such instance in history, the Japanese broadcaster NHK World reported on Jan. 16, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has deepened its diplomatic and military ties with North Korea. Last fall, Pyongyang sent troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to bolster Moscow&apos;s efforts against a Ukrainian incursion. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov announced on Jan. 15 that military from 19 &quot;friendly&quot; countries have been invited to the Victory Day parade. NHK&apos;s sources said that tens of North Korean personnel are expected to participate in the commemoration of the victory in World War II. Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov signaled back in December 2024 that North Korean troops might join the event. Additionally, a North Korean military band is reportedly set to perform at a music event in Moscow in late August, marking the first time North Korean military representatives will participate in such events in Russia. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. The Kremlin heavily leverages the annual Victory Day celebrations to project military strength and propagate its narrative of Soviet heroism in World War II. Russian propaganda continues to exploit these historical victories, using them to justify its current aggression against Ukraine. Putin has framed the war as a mission to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; Ukraine, a false accusation rooted in his broader disinformation campaign.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-to-join-russias-victory-day-parade/	2025-01-16T05:06:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. According to the military, the targeted oil depot stored fuel, which was used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-voronezh-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-16T04:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Russia claims it struck Lviv Oblast gas storage facilities; Ukraine reports no disruptions	Russia claimed it had damaged ground facilities at one of Ukraine&apos;s largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast during a series of missile and drone attacks on Jan. 15. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the attacks were retaliation for an alleged Ukrainian strike on a gas compressor station in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region on Jan. 11, a key point for the TurkStream pipeline, the last conduit for Russian gas to Europe. Russian attacks also occurred a day after Ukraine launched a series of strikes on Russian military and industrial facilities, including ammunition depots and refineries. Moscow has consistently targeted Ukraine&apos;s residential areas and energy infrastructure throughout the full-scale war, regardless of Ukraine&apos;s actions. Lviv Oblast officials confirmed damage to critical infrastructure in two districts but reported no casualties. The acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned Naftogaz energy company, Roman Chumak, also confirmed that gas infrastructure was targeted but said that gas supplies were uninterrupted and repairs would be conducted swiftly. The strikes, which included Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, were part of a broader assault on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha previously praised Kyiv&apos;s decision to halt Russian gas transit as a critical measure to weaken the Kremlin&apos;s leverage over Europe. Ukraine ceased the transit through its territory on Jan. 1, aiming to avoid financing Moscow&apos;s war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/gas-storage-facilities-attack/	2025-01-16T04:45:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
You were shot. Why didn't you forgive?' Zelensky tells Fico, drawing parallels to Russian aggression	The Slovak government is playing very dangerous game by criticizing military support for Ukraine and getting closer to Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the Polish media on Jan. 16. &quot;The Slovak leaders are playing a very dangerous game. They will continue to do so until the war reaches their own homes,&quot; Zelensky said. The comments come amid a growing rift between Ukraine and Slovakia as Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico threatened Kyiv with repercussions over its decision to halt the Russian gas transit to the EU. Fico, who visited Moscow in December to discuss gas supply issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also consistently criticized military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Talking to Polish journalists, Zelensky recalled his conversation with the Slovak prime minister during a meeting of European leaders. &quot;I told him: &apos;You were shot at. Why didn&apos;t you forgive? Why did you arrest this person who injured you?&apos;&quot; Zelensky said, drawing a parallel between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an assassination attempt on the Slovak prime minister. Fico was critically injured after being shot in the Slovak town of Handlova on May 15, 2024, following a government meeting. Slovak authorities said that the attack was politically motivated. The suspect, 71-year-old writer Juraj Cintula, has been detained and is awaiting trial. &quot;I reminded this to him (Fico) and told him that all of us, no matter your positions, condemned such steps because a living person was shot at,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s Putin. He is the same; he shoots living people, albeit through the hands of others.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/you-were-shot-at-why-didnt-you-forgive-zelensky-tells-fico/	2025-01-16T04:35:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg
Trump sending 'non-public messages' on war, he must force Putin to diplomacy, Zelensky says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Polish media released on Jan. 16, not ruling out that it may happen in 2025. &quot;These are his (Trump&apos;s) messages, both public and non-public. And he is a capable leader to put pressure on Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine, often referring to his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the Ukrainian president, Trump should agree on real security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;He must force Putin to diplomacy, to end this war,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump&apos;s push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. About 20% of Ukrainian territory is currently under occupation by Russian forces. Some of Trump&apos;s advisors have signaled a timeline of at least several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-must-force-putin-to-diplomacy-zelensky-says/	2025-01-16T03:43:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Russian officer jailed for accidentally shooting down own helicopter in Crimea	A Russian air defense officer stationed in occupied Sevastopol, Igor Pashkov, has been sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for shooting down a Russian army helicopter after mistaking it for a drone, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 16. Russian investigative authorities charged Pashko with violations of combat duty rules, which resulted in grave consequences. The incident occurred on Dec. 18, 2023, in occupied Crimea. Pashkov, while on combat duty, received a report on what he believed to be a low-flying drone. Acting on incomplete information and failing to confirm the target&apos;s identity in time, he launched a missile salvo from a TOR-M2DT anti-aircraft system. The missile struck a Russian Mi-8 helicopter, which crashed into the Black Sea, killing the crew on board. Pashkov admitted guilt in May 2024, and the prosecution sought a seven-year sentence. In the first instance, the military court sentenced him to three years, a term later reduced by a higher court by two months. In addition to his prison sentence, Pashkov is barred from holding positions involving organizational or administrative functions in the civil service or local government for one year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officer-jailed-over-helicopter-downing/	2025-01-16T03:26:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1212056374.jpg
Ukraine’s Emergency Service denies claims of mass mobilization, says 90% of staff are exempt	Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service refuted claims that 50% of its employees would be mobilized, saying on Jan. 16 via Facebook that 90% of its personnel are exempt from mobilization. &quot;Every day, State Emergency Service employees rescue citizens and mitigate the consequences of Russian attacks, often at the cost of their health and lives,&quot; the agency said, urging the public to rely on verified information. The State Emergency Service clarified that rapid response units &#x2014; firefighters, sappers, rescuers, chemists, engineers, and similar specialists &#x2014; are fully exempt from mobilization to continue critical operations. This denial follows opposition MP Oleksii Honcharenko&apos;s Telegram post alleging plans for widespread State Emergency Service mobilization after Feb. 28, which the State Emergency Service labeled as misinformation. The news also comes amid reports of personnel transfers from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force to the Ground Forces, reported by Ukrainska Pravda on Jan. 14. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi allegedly had ordered the reassignment of over 5,000 Air Force personnel to address infantry shortages, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Speaking anonymously, a senior Air Force officer warned that such transfers risk undermining unit effectiveness, especially for anti-aircraft missile systems that require highly trained and cohesive teams. The officer added that if transfers proceed as planned, some units could see staffing levels drop to 40%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied these claims on Jan. 14, saying that technical and aviation personnel numbers are increasing rather than being reassigned. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. About 930,000 Ukrainians liable for military service are temporarily exempt from conscription, Forbes Ukraine reported last August. The Ukrainian government has also permitted businesses to reserve up to 50% of their employees if their enterprises are deemed critical to the economy&#x2019;s functioning.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-emergency-service-denies-claims-of-mass-mobilization-says-90-of-staff-are-exempt/	2025-01-16T03:08:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-25_09-40-25.jpg
Ukraine extends cooperation with Norwegian NASAMS systems supplier	Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-extends-cooperation-with-norwegian-nasams-systems-supplier/	2025-01-16T02:33:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_11-31-44.jpg
Russia discusses buying gas for Transnistria in Europe, media reports	Moscow and local authorities in Transnistria are discussing the possibility of purchasing gas for Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied region on the European spot market via an intermediary company, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 15, citing unnamed sources. The costs are likely to be compensated by the Russian budget, the newspaper reported. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom claimed that it halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s alleged unpaid debts rather than transit issues. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. The Russian-held region is dependent on Russian supplies while the rest of the country pivoted toward European sellers. According to Kommersant&apos;s sources, gas may be purchased from January to April in amounts of up to 3 million cubic meters per day. The outlet estimates the price at $164 million. Supplies to Tiraspoltransgaz, the largest gas provider in the region, are likely to be carried out not by Moldovagaz, which has a monopoly on supplies to Transnistria, but by another Moldovan gas supplier, Natural Gaz D.C., the outlet wrote. &#xA0; Arkady Vikol, the co-owner of Natural Gaz D.C., confirmed that his company had signed a framework contract with Tiraspoltransgaz to supply 2 to 3 million cubic meters of gas per day to Transnistria. Moldova&apos;s Security and Intelligence Service interrogated Vikol over his company&apos;s plans to organize gas supplies to Transnistria, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said. Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, said Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of the Moscow-controlled region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-discusses-buying-gas-for-transnistria-in-europe-media-reports/	2025-01-16T02:08:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Ukrainian paratroopers capture 27 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast	Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in the southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukrainian out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-paratroopers-capture-27-russian-soldiers-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-16T01:44:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Prisoners.png
Italy's Defense Minister Crosetto arrives in Kyiv on official visit	Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 for a &quot;series of institutional meetings,&quot; Italy&apos;s Defense Ministry announced. Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on the same day as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is in the Ukrainian capital to sign a &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; agreement and discuss further cooperation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Italian ministry did not reveal who is Crosetto expected to meet or the topic of the discussions. The European officials are visiting Ukraine mere days before the start of Donald Trump&apos;s presidency, which could have a major impact on the progress of the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump has pledged to push both sides to the negotiating table and reportedly backed the idea of European partners deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. Crosetto previously voiced support for the idea, suggesting Italy is open to joining the peacekeeping mission. Starmer is also expected to discuss the topic with Zelensky during his visit. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Italy has delivered 10 military aid packages, including advanced SAMP/T air defenses, to Ukraine. The country&apos;s cabinet recently approved the extension of the assistance for Ukraine throughout 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-defense-minister-crosetto-arrives-in-kyiv-on-official-visit/	2025-01-16T01:14:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/808eccb3-7186-4cfb-83f3-59e9cc1f33b1.jpeg
Ukraine is still free' — Biden touts his admin's accomplishments in farewell speech	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden briefly mentioned Ukraine during his farewell speech on Jan. 15, saying his administration helped to preserve the country&apos;s freedom. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&#x2019;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; the U.S. president said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including stronger NATO. Biden ends his first and only four-year term on Jan. 20, to be succeeded by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration has provided $65.9 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, making it Kyiv&apos;s largest donor. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&#x2019;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&#x2019;ll grow, and they&#x2019;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; Biden said. Despite the provided support, the Biden administration has often attracted criticism for its self-restricting and hesitant approach, with many key military capabilities being greenlighted only after prolonged pressure. Before winning his reelection, Trump had criticized the military aid for Ukraine and pledged to cut a swift deal to end the war and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict. This sparked concerns that the incoming U.S. president could reduce defense aid or push Kyiv toward a painful peace deal. Trump and his team later signaled that they do not plan to abandon Ukraine, though Secretary of State nominee Marc Rubio said Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve a ceasefire. Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Ukrainian forces hold on to a piece of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a potential trump card in expected talks. Both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the full-scale war, with Ukraine dealing with manpower shortages and Russia with a struggling economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-free-biden-stresses-in-farewell-speech/	2025-01-16T00:31:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193228711.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 27 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed four people and injured at least 27 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces downed 34 out of 55 drones, including Shahed-type ones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 18 were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Debris from downed drones damaged energy infrastructure in Poltava Oblast, leaving hundreds of people without power, the local military administration said. Russian attacks on the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed a 54-year-old woman and injured a 45-year-old man, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. The attack damaged around 30 houses, five high-rise buildings, industrial enterprises, and cars, he added. A total of 15 people were injured in the town of Kramatorsk and the villages of Kostiantynopil, Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, Stinky, and Chernihivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A Russian drone attack on the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast injured a 73-year-old man, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed and 10 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-injure-27-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T00:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-15_16-09-03.jpg
Ukraine blows up mine shaft to hamper Russian advance to Pokrovsk, NYT reports	Ukraine blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane in Donetsk Oblast to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town of Pokrovsk, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 15, citing miners. According to the Ukrainian miners, at some point, the shaft, located southeast of Pokrovsk, became too dangerous to work in due to constant Russian attacks. They switched to descending into the mine through another shaft. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. In the meantime, Russian troops advanced to within a mile of mine No. 3, raising fears that they could seize it and use its tunnels to outflank Ukraine&apos;s positions, according to the NYT. The miners and Ukrainian soldiers began drilling holes under the shaft to plant explosives, several workers told the outlet. The shaft was blown up around Dec. 20, 2024. Keeping the mine operational as long as possible was crucial to the Ukrainian economy, as it produced coking coal required for steelmaking &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. An unnamed manager at Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, told the NYT that explosives were also planted in the facility&#x2019;s two other shafts located further west, near the Ukraine-controlled villages of Kotlyne and Udachne. It is unknown whether they have been detonated. Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-blows-up-shaft-in-pokrovsk-nyt/	2025-01-15T23:33:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184979920.jpg
Ukraine hopes to open all 6 negotiating clusters on EU accession in 2025, Zelensky says	Ukraine has the &quot;ambitious goal&quot; to open five or six EU accession negotiation clusters in 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Ukraine will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, Zelensky said during his official visit to Warsaw. Poland will lead the EU Council&apos;s presidency for six months from January, and Denmark will take over the role in July. Ukraine aims to open three more negotiation clusters in the second half of 2025 under the Danish chairmanship, the president noted. &quot;We have an ambitious goal to open five to six clusters. In principle, we can open them all this year, if we succeed. We will try to do it all,&quot; Zelensky said. There are six accession negotiation clusters, consisting of several individual chapters. Negotiations prepare a candidate country to become an EU member. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. EU membership, alongside continued weapons shipments and NATO accession, are among the key security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky said on Jan. 15 as his country continues to face Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-eu-negotiations/	2025-01-15T23:20:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Ukrainian drone strike reportedly targets gunpowder factory in Russia's Tambov Oblast	A Ukrainian drone strike targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16, local Telegram channels and a Ukrainian official claimed. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. The same night, a Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast reportedly caught fire as a result of the drone attack. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s escalating drone campaign targeting Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear. Kyiv launched one of its most massive long-range attacks on Jan. 14, successfully striking refineries, chemical plants, and ammunition depots, including a distillery in Novaya Lyada in Tambov Oblast. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory was previously struck by Ukrainian drones in July 2024, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent at the time.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strike-reportedly-targets-gunpowder-factory-in-russias-tambov-oblast/	2025-01-15T22:58:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg

UK PM Starmer makes surprise visit to Kyiv, will sign '100 Year Partnership' with Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 amid an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, where Starmer is set to sign a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty, covering a number of areas including defense, energy, and trade. Starmer&apos;s visit marks just his second trip to the Ukrainian capital, and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. &quot;This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come,&quot; Starmer said in a news release on the treaty. Starmer&apos;s visit to Ukraine comes as the U.K. continues to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country ahead of potential peace negotiations. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv in the coming weeks to further discuss with Zelensky the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment. Donald Trump has also advocated for Europe to take the lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 that Trump emphasized Europe&#x2019;s greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-pm-starmer-make-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-will-sign-100-year-partnership-with-ukraine/	2025-01-15T21:54:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160310001.jpg
Members of Trump's team admit Ukraine-Russia peace settlement could take months, Reuters reports	Several advisors to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have accepted a timeline of several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15, citing two Trump associates who directly spoke to president-elect about the war. Trump has previously promised to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in 24 hours. As Trump&apos;s inauguration approaches, Keith Kellogg Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy has said the Trump administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine within 100 days after inauguration. Trump&apos;s campaign promise to end the war in a day was a lack of appreciation for intractability of the conflict due to its complexity, and did not consider how long it would take to staff a new administration, the two Trump associates said. Trump has voiced readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin the process of establishing a potential peace agreement. Kellogg is also slated to meet with Ukrainian officials following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, and will also visit other European capitals to discuss the war. Trump has called for more European leadership to end the war, including the potential of European peacekeepers. Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 that both sides need to be &quot;realistic,&quot; in a potential ceasefire agreement. Rubio suggested a concession from Russia would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. can not approach peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia as a neutral mediator, and recognize Russia as an aggressor.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-admits-ukraine-peace-settlement-could-take-months-reuters-reports/	2025-01-15T20:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
NATO, EU membership, military strength are strategic security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky says	NATO and EU membership, as well as the country&apos;s own military strength are key security guarantees for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in days, Zelensky and European allies are preparing for a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, including a proposed ceasefire and peace negotiations. &quot;We want to end the war with a just peace, but for that, we need to be sure that Russia will not return to wage war against Ukraine. We need strong security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said. Continued weapons shipments, NATO accession, and EU membership are key security guarantees, Zelensky said, noting that the country cannot engage in &quot;games&quot; reducing the size of its military. Ahead of potential peace negotiation, a large military was &quot;the only security guarantee,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comment on the size of Ukraine&apos;s military come as Russian President Vladimir Putin is set demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during upcoming talks with Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported. Zelensky touted the size of Ukraine&apos;s military during the press conference, stating that the country&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Ukrainian officials are expected to meet with members of Trump&apos;s administration shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20 to discuss the details of peace negotiations. Despite unease over Trump&apos;s stance on Ukraine, there have been reports that European allies have grown optimistic Trump will not abandon Ukraine. Trump met with Zelensky during his election campaign and a second time following his U.S. presidential election victory on Dec. 7 on the sidelines of the Notre Dame Cathedrals re-opening in a trilateral meeting with Macron. Trump has voiced he is ready to meet with Putin once he takes office to spearhead peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, a move Ukraine and European allies are approaching cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-and-eu-membership-are-strategic-security-guarantees-for-ukraine/	2025-01-15T19:28:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
US sanctions Russian entity operating occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Jan. 15 sanctioned Russia&apos;s Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, a Moscow-created entity that took control of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia power plant in the partially occupied oblast. The updated sanctions list also targets Vladislav Isaev, the company&#x2019;s CEO since April 2024. In October 2022, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree establishing the Russian entity to oversee the captured power plant. This followed an order from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who declared the facilities of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant as Russian federal property. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022, and have been using the site in ways that increase the risk of a nuclear disaster. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. The region, particularly the city of Zaporizhzhia and the areas around the nuclear power plant, has endured regular missile strikes, artillery shelling, and drone attacks. On Jan. 8, Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 people and injuring 122, including a child, according to State Emergency Service.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-entity-operating-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/	2025-01-15T17:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Ukraine captures 23 Russian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast	Ukraine&#x2019;s Azov Brigade captured 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations in the Toretsk area of Donetsk Oblast, the National Guard of Ukraine reported on Jan. 15. According to the statement, some Russian troops surrendered willingly, while others were found hiding in basements or captured during assaults. The captives, taken into custody by the 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov, are reportedly in satisfactory condition. &#x1F4CD;&#x422;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x435;&#x446;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x43D;&#x430;&#x43F;&#x440;&#x44F;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x43A; &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;&#x412;&#x43E;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438; 12 &#x431;&#x440;&#x438;&#x433;&#x430;&#x434;&#x438; &#x41D;&#x430;&#x446;&#x433;&#x432;&#x430;&#x440;&#x434;&#x456;&#x457; &#xAB;&#x410;&#x437;&#x43E;&#x432;&#xBB; &#x432;&#x437;&#x44F;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x443; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D; &#x43E;&#x434;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437;&#x443; 23 (!) &#x437;&#x430;&#x433;&#x430;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;-&#x43D;&#x435;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x445;&#x438; &#x456; &#x437;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x443;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x43D;&#x435;&#x432;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x447;&#x43A;&#x435; &#xAB;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x442;&#x438;&#x432;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x435;&#xBB; &#x432;&#x456;&#x434;&#x435;&#x43E; &#x434;&#x43B;&#x44F; &#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438;-&#x430;&#x433;&#x440;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x430;. &#x426;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x432;&#x43E;, &#x449;&#x43E; &#x431;&#x430;&#x433;&#x430;&#x442;&#x43E; &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x445; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x445; &#x432;&#x438;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x434;&#x430;&#x44E;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x434;&#x43E; &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x443; &#x442;&#x430;&#x43A;, &#x44F;&#x43A; &#x43D;&#x430;&#x448;&#x456; &#x433;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x2014; &#x43F;&#x456;&#x441;&#x43B;&#x44F; &#x1F914;&#x1F4F9;: @azov_media pic.twitter.com/sE00z6HM2Z The National Guard confirmed that the prisoners would be transferred to the relevant authorities. &quot;We hope they will soon be exchanged for Ukrainian defenders held in captivity,&quot; it said. On Jan. 15, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 25 individuals from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-captures-23-russian-soldiers-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-15T15:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251978609.jpg
Oil depot on fire in Russia's Voronezh region	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh region caught fire following multiple drone strikes, regional governor Alexander Gusev said on Jan. 15. No casualties were reported, according to Gusev. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. In response, Russia has continued missile strikes on Ukraine&#x2019;s already battered energy network. On Jan. 15, explosions were reported in several Ukrainian oblasts. In Lviv Oblast, &#xA0;Andriy Sadovyi, city mayor, said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning, Lviv Oblast officials said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-on-fire-in-russias-voronezh-region/	2025-01-15T13:35:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1342639538.jpg
Putin to demand Ukraine never join NATO during talks with Trump, Bloomberg reports	Russia will demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 15, citing its sources. Trump has previously signaled that he is ready to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; following his inauguration, adding that the Kremlin is also seeking it. Trump has repeatedly reiterated that he plans to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, in part because he allegedly has good ties with Putin. The Kremlin reportedly accepts that individual NATO member states can continue to send weapons to Ukraine as part of bilateral security agreements, but the weapons &quot;should not be used against Russia or to recapture territory,&quot; one of the sources told Bloomberg. Moscow&apos;s position is that it will de facto retain control over almost 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory, including the Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014. In the meantime, Russia is allegedly open to exchange some territories, the media outlet reported, citing its sources. Kyiv and Moscow are currently holding talks only on the exchange of prisoners and the return of deported children, Ukrainian officials told the media outlet on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are also having &quot;limited talks&quot; in Qatar on the rules for protecting nuclear facilities from attacks, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s preparations. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration threw behind Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-demand-ukraine-never-join-nato-during-talks-with-trump-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-15T12:17:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2160580179.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Kyiv claims	Key developments on Jan. 15: President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&apos;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&apos;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, using Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning of Jan. 15, officials in Lviv Oblast said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties. There was no information on what was hit or the extent of the damage caused. Svitlana Onyshchuk, head of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Military Administration, said the attacks had targeted &quot;critical infrastructure facilities&quot; in the oblast but had not caused any casualties. No further details were provided. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced. &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and the target for the Russians remains the same: our energy sector,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel later in the morning on Jan. 15. &quot;More than 40 missiles were involved in this strike, including ballistic missiles. At least 30 were destroyed. There were also more than 70 Russian attack drones overnight,&quot; he added. &quot;We constantly need to strengthen the existing capabilities of the Ukrainian air shield. Our partners at the NATO summit in Washington and in the Ramstein format made promises that have not yet been fully realized.&quot; Shortly after eight in the morning, the all-clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions to end the war, Marco Rubio, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called on everyone to be realistic, suggesting that Russia&apos;s concession would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. &quot;It is important for everyone to be realistic: There will have to be concessions &#x2014; made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians&#x2026; It is also important that there be some balance on both sides,&quot; Rubio said. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to negotiate a swift end to the war after taking office. However, he has never elaborated on how exactly he plans to achieve that. &quot;There is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine. The Ukrainians are too brave and fight too hard, and the country is too big. That&apos;s not gonna happen,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It is also unrealistic to believe that somehow a nation the size of Ukraine&#x2026; gonna push these people (Russian troops) all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion,&quot; he added. According to Rubio, the U.S. must not allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to return to his plans to take over Ukraine in four or five years. Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, which was eventually passed in April 2024. Rubio did not support President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s policy regarding assistance to Ukraine, as, according to him, the White House &quot;has never been clear about how this conflict will end.&quot; The 53-year-old Florida Senator will replace Antony Blinken in the position, and as the top U.S. diplomat, he would be at the forefront of potential peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at the selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude to the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024. Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&apos;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&apos;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&apos;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&apos;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&apos;s spending, NATO&apos;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&apos;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&apos;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-kyiv-claims/	2025-01-15T12:12:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190608033.jpg
Ukraine, Russia have to make concessions to end war, Rubio says	Both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions to end the war, Marco Rubio, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called on everyone to be realistic, suggesting that Russia&apos;s concession would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. &quot;It is important for everyone to be realistic: There will have to be concessions &#x2014; made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians&#x2026; It is also important that there be some balance on both sides,&quot; Rubio said. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to negotiate a swift end to the war after taking office. However, he has never elaborated on how exactly he plans to achieve that. &quot;There is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine. The Ukrainians are too brave and fight too hard, and the country is too big. That&apos;s not gonna happen,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It is also unrealistic to believe that somehow a nation the size of Ukraine&#x2026; gonna push these people (Russian troops) all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion,&quot; he added. According to Rubio, the U.S. must not allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to return to his plans to take over Ukraine in four or five years. Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, which was eventually passed in April 2024. Rubio did not support President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s policy regarding assistance to Ukraine, as, according to him, the White House &quot;has never been clear about how this conflict will end.&quot; The 53-year-old Florida Senator will replace Antony Blinken in the position, and as the top U.S. diplomat, he would be at the forefront of potential peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-have-to-make-concessions-to-end-war-rubio-says/	2025-01-15T11:50:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182884019.jpg
US targets China-Russia sanctions evasion scheme with new measures	The U.S. Treasury Department has targeted actors involved in a sanctions evasion scheme facilitating cross-border payments for sensitive goods between China and Russia as part of a new package of sanctions, according to a Jan. 15 announcement. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. &quot;Today&apos;s actions frustrate the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent our sanctions and get access to the goods they need to build weapons for their war of choice in Ukraine,&quot; said Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Wally Adeyemo. Moscow and Beijing set up regional clearing platforms (RCPs) in both Russia and China to act as counterparties for cross-border payments for sensitive goods. This allows for non-cash mutual payments for sanctioned goods, according to the Treasury. The Russian-Chinese scheme involves Russian financial institutions on the U.S. sanctions list, such as Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia, Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank, Open Joint Stock Company Sovcombank, T-Bank, and Limited Liability Company Bank Tochka. The sanctions also target OJSC Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, which has been coordinating with Russian officials and Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions, to evade sanctions since the summer of 2024. In 2024, the Kyrgyz Finance Ministry sold a controlling stake in Keremet Bank to a firm closely linked to Russian-Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, who has ties to the Russian government. The purchase of Keremet Bank was intended to create a hub for circumventing sanctions through which Russia could pay for imports and receive payments for exports, according to the statement. The new sanctions also target 20 Russian energy companies and over 30 organizations and institutions from the defense and related sectors. Earlier on Jan. 10, the U.S. and U.K. imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the sanctions as a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-targets-china-russia-sanctions-evasion-scheme-with-new-measures/	2025-01-15T11:16:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1781860144.jpg
Will Europe put ‘boots on the ground’ for peace in Ukraine? We asked top Nordic, Baltic officials	Just days out from the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the future of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is dominated by a great unknown: whether the incoming president will manage to push Moscow to stop its advance on the battlefield, or whether he will disengage and perhaps abandon U.S. support for Ukraine entirely. Either way, one thing is clear: the war cannot come to an end with a secure Ukraine without Europe playing a braver role. The chance of the guns and drones going silent across Ukraine in 24 hours after Trump takes office &#x2014; as Trump had frequently promised on the campaign trail &#x2014; is slim to none. Nonetheless, amid consistent rhetoric from Washington that Europe must up defense spending and take more responsibility for their continent&#x2019;s security, European countries are faced with an urgent task: taking the braver steps to secure Ukraine against a bullish Moscow seemingly more convinced in its forthcoming victory than at any time since February 2022. In a new reality far removed from the war of 2022, the catch phrase going into 2025 is now &#x201C;boots on the ground.&#x201D; The first serious floating of the idea of European troops entering Ukrainian territory came from French President Emmanuel Macron in the spring of 2024. &#x201C;In fact, many countries said that in the weeks that followed that they understood our approach, that they agreed with our position and that this position was a good thing.&#x201D; French soldiers with the 1st Infantry Regiment fire mortars near Rena, Norway, during Exercise Brilliant Jump 2022, on March 17, 2022. The exercise, aimed at training the very high-readiness component of the NATO Response Force, involved around 2,500 troops from France, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Spain, with 10 warships and 750 sailors supporting the operation at sea.

(Photo by Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images)Media coverage of hypothetical European &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; is often presented in the context of a peacekeeping force entering Ukrainian territory after a hypothetical peace deal. While clear that larger players like France, Poland, or the U.K. would need to be involved, and that it is hard to imagine a new level of European action without the backing of the incoming U.S. administration, the role of smaller countries in the Nordic and Baltic states also looks to be critical. Consistently among the top providers of military aid to Kyiv as a percentage of GDP, countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have also been the most outspoken in their support for Ukrainian victory, beyond the tired repetitions of &#x201C;as long as it takes.&#x201D; Recent alleged Russian sabotage attacks in the Baltic Sea, including the damaging of undersea cables running between Nordic and Baltic states, have served as a reminder that Russia&#x2019;s war is not limited to Ukrainian territory. The Kyiv Independent spoke to top officials, experts, and other stakeholders in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top European partners to take the pulse of countries that could be part of a new &#x201C;coalition of the willing&#x201D; in their support of Ukraine in 2025. Before facing up to Trump, let alone Putin, the first major hurdle European countries must overcome is their own mindset, according to Jukka Kopra, chair of the Finnish parliament&#x2019;s defense committee. &#x201C;Finland has always taken defense seriously. So we have a conscription system. We have a large reserve-based army,&#x201D; Kopra said to the Kyiv Independent in Helsinki. &#x201C;Nobody&apos;s ever ready for war, but we have things in order. We take it seriously, unlike some other countries who only have things working on paper.&#x201D; Although relatively small in terms of hard geopolitical sway, since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the countries immediately bordering Russia have often found themselves in the role of activist, pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s crystal-clear message that peace must come through strength in the NATO arena. &#x201C;One might think that when the escalated aggression started in February 2022, everybody&apos;s eyes would open,&#x201D; said Kopra. &#x201C;They are opening slowly, but not everywhere.&#x201D; Of all NATO member states, none show more clarity than the Baltic States, where the memory of Soviet occupation and the totalitarian repression that came with it remains fresh. Only recently stepping down after his country&#x2019;s last elections, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrelius Landsbergis has been one the most eloquent pro-Ukrainian voices among foreign officials. Lithuania&apos;s former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis at Munich Security Conference 2024 in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;Appeasement is a recurring virus; the seasons vary in how often it does reoccur in Europe, but it always comes back,&#x201D; said Landsbergis to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The logic is always the same. I am the person who can appease, who can offer part of some other country to a dictator and all of us will be fine. It&apos;s so iconic when you see Chamberlain resurrected in 2024 in Europe and picking up the phone and saying, &#x2018;I have this.&#x2019;&#x201D; Landsbergis wasn&#x2019;t the only Baltic minister to mention the infamous British prime minister, who had signed the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany less than a year before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. &#x201C;If it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression,&#x201D; said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna to the Kyiv Independent in Tallinn. &#x201C;Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order.&#x201D; As clear as the rhetoric of the Nordics and Baltics has been, taking braver steps still requires the leadership of countries with more weight to throw around. &#x201C;These conversations have matured,&#x201D; said French security expert Leonie Allard to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But you need much more political weight from other Europeans, which we haven&apos;t seen so much.&#x201D; Germany, traditionally cautious but still the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine, looks to be completely absorbed by upcoming federal elections in February, while France&#x2019;s government collapsed in December. These countries that have traditionally been the leaders of Europe, they are kind of incapable at the moment,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;and what a coincidence it is, what a good position for the Kremlin.&#x201D; Still, the clear choice to take the lead is Paris, said Allard, who co-authored a recent paper published by the Atlantic Council entitled &#x201C;Europe needs a coalition of the resolute.&#x201D; Macron brings with him to the table personal experience dealing with both Putin and Trump, which could be crucial in coordinating a braver European bloc. &#x201C;France cannot do anything on its own, nothing at all,&#x201D; said Allard, &#x201C;it&apos;s also up to other Europeans to, you know, take this opportunity to put forward their own ideas on what they want to do.&#x201D; The other obvious candidate to strengthen such a coalition would be Poland, the nation with the most to lose in national security from an abandonment of neighboring Ukraine.

(Chesnot / Getty Images)Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has denied reports claiming he discussed deploying troops to Ukraine with Macron, as Warsaw sticks closely to a doctrine of beefing up its military to defend NATO borders. Still, the possibility of Poland changing its tune shouldn&#x2019;t be ruled out, said Allard. &#x201C;What other war is NATO preparing for apart from one with Russia?&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&apos;s only one thing, and if that thing means being in Ukraine, then it should be being in Ukraine. There is no other scenario.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whatever the solution is to the present situation in the war between Ukraine and Russia,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;in any case, we are back in the Cold War, and all of Europe should start accelerating accordingly.&#x201D; Since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyiv has stressed that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t need foreign militaries to join the fight: the West only needs to provide the weaponry and ammunition, and Ukraine will do the job. When it comes to direct combat with Russian forces, this position hasn&#x2019;t changed, but with a dangerous and unpredictable outlook for the war in 2025, other versions of &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; are being explored to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position. A starting point often discussed is training. If conducted far from the front line, moving the existing overseas training programs into Ukrainian territory would not only make them more efficient, but send a strong signal to Moscow that the West will not just retreat to NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson pointed out that representatives of his country&#x2019;s defense procurement agency were already on the ground in Ukraine, and that Sweden wouldn&#x2019;t rule out training Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian territory. Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson at the Munich Security Conference in Berlin, Germany on Feb. 16, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We think it&apos;s good if we can find unity on this, there are ongoing discussions in several different places in Europe,&#x201D; he said. According to Landsbergis, a move for European countries to begin training Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine could be the first step in a series of careful moves that will slowly but surely up the deterrence factor for Moscow. &#x201C;If they&apos;re trained in Ukraine, imagine that where troops are trained, the areas are defended with additional air defense support. You bring Lithuanian and French troops, the French bring in the air defense, and we start covering parts of Ukrainian territory.&#x201D; Nonetheless, for now, the majority of attention has been on the use of European troops as a physical security guarantee, as expressed by Zelensky after his calls with Macron. After a tough two years of attritional warfare which saw a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 and a steadily worsening manpower crisis, the fading perspective of a complete Ukrainian victory has turned attention to the need for peace to come with hard guarantees against a repeat Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint press conference with NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg at the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, DC, on July 11, 2024. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)Trump and his team, many of whom publicly subscribe to the myth that &#x201C;NATO expansion&#x201D; was one of the main causes of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, have spoken strongly against inviting Kyiv to the alliance, an offer that sat at the top of Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan as presented to partners in October. &#x201C;What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are four countries that gave security guarantees for Ukraine (in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum). One of them attacked Ukraine &#x2015; Russia &#x2015; and the three others are not fulfilling that agreement.&#x201D; &#x201C;Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war,&#x201D; said Braze, &#x201C;because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war.&#x201D; Though not as physically threatened by Russia as the Nordics or Baltics, France&#x2019;s leading role in a future troop deployment makes a lot of sense due to the organization of its military and recent experience, said Allard. &#x201C;France is the country that has an army structure that&apos;s based a lot on expeditionary forces, used to send forces abroad,&#x201D; she said, pointing to a wealth of recent French experience operating in the Sahel region in Africa. French soldiers take part in a major drill as part of NATO&apos;s &quot;enhanced forward presence&quot; (EFP) deployment in Poland and the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania at the Tapa Estonian army camp near Rakvere, Estonia, on Feb. 5, 2022. (Alain Jocard / AFP via Getty Images)Once the time comes for deployment, it is very unlikely that European troops could be stationed along the contact line itself, as sometimes broached in visions of a so-called &#x201C;demilitarized zone.&#x201D; What is more realistic, said Allard, is the deployment of European forces in bases further back, with the explicit purpose of acting as a so-called &#x201C;tripwire force,&#x201D; with the explicit purpose of making any further Russian aggression in Ukraine immediately come at the cost of direct conflict with NATO. &#x201C;The size and the ability of this tripwire force to weigh on Ukraine security would be dependent on the level of lethality that we find ourselves in, in a situation of a deal.&#x201D; Ultimately, in the absence of NATO membership for Ukraine, &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; might just be the kind of ad-hoc measure that is enough to deter an aging, weakened Putin from launching a repeat invasion. &#x201C;It changes Putin&apos;s calculations,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of the tripwire effect, &#x201C;because as President Macron clearly said, Putin will have to keep in mind that if you enter Odesa, you will find French troops.&#x201D; As much as real discussions might be ongoing among a potential future European &#x201C;coalition of the willing,&#x201D; even the most basic public specifics are still lacking. The reason for indecisiveness and delay is one person, Trump, but even more so, said Allard, is the looming anticipation of the results of his first steps for ending the war. &#x201C;We&apos;re waiting for the U.S. to put forward the terms of the potential negotiations,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;since it&apos;s their view &#x2014; that of the Trump team &#x2014; and try to help Ukraine to also be able to shape that. But if this goes forward, Europeans are ready to take on more responsibility.&#x201D; With Russia publicly rejecting early attempts at drawing up a tentative peace deal, Trump&#x2019;s incoming envoy for peace in Ukraine, retired General Keith Kellogg, has named 100 days as his personal target to reach a deal.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)&#x201C;The coin is still in the air, right? We don&apos;t know which side it will land on,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of Trump&#x2019;s approach to Putin upon inauguration. &#x201C;I think it&apos;s rather black and white, right? It&apos;s impossible that it lands on a situation which would be comfortable for both, for Ukrainians and Russians. That means that if you give something to Putin, that will be his victory and Ukrainian loss.&#x201D; In the meantime though, argues Allard, the last thing Europe should do is sit idle. If wants to weigh on Putin&apos;s decision to enter negotiations, Europe should try to move forward with a developed public position on troops in Ukraine now, she said. &#x201C;It&apos;s now that we, Europeans, should prepare and form this notion and not after a negotiation.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/will-europe-put-boots-on-the-ground-for-peace-in-ukraine-we-asked-top-nordic-baltic-officials/	2025-01-15T10:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2154604513.jpg
Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POW	After numerous attempts, Ukrainian forces operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast have finally captured two North Korean soldiers.

One of the two soldiers was taken prisoner by Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces.

Ukraine’s military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-zelensky-says/	2025-01-15T09:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Why Ukraine’s long-delayed missile production ambitions have yet to get off the ground	The Ukrainian government in recent months has been aggressively touting fresh developments in its missile-making. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had built 100 of its own missiles in 2024 as of November. He called for 3,000 &#x201C;cruise missiles or missile-drones&#x201D; to be manufactured in 2025. Traditional missiles are tricky. Ukraine&#x2019;s notable successes in scaling up drone production were to a large degree a workaround of the country&#x2019;s limits in defense industry autonomy. Russia and the West gutted Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons factories after the fall of the USSR, with the help of local corruption. Those that remain are subject to constant Russian bombardment. As a result, analysts call Zelensky&#x2019;s figures and the claimed features of traditional missiles made at home an oversell. &#x201C;If Ukraine can only deliver half of what Zelensky promised at the end of 2024 in terms of missile and drone production, I will be very content. But that&apos;s going to be challenging,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert and research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project. Ukraine&#x2019;s budding missile program joins a long tradition of metaphorical and literal saber-rattling between hostile armies. For the time being, the missiles have yet to prove themselves on the battlefield. The challenge for outside observers is in sorting out ballistics from bluster. Here is what we know and can assess of the roster of Ukraine&#x2019;s home-grown missiles today. Originally designed to hit ships from coastal positions, the Neptune has been converted into a cruise missile that can be launched from land, per Ukrainian authorities. It is what Hoffmann calls &#x201C;by far the most mature of these large missile projects.&#x201D; Ukrainian officials said it was a Neptune that struck and sank the Russian cruiser Moskva back in April 2022. An unnamed official told the War Zone that they had reconfigured the Neptune to strike and disable an S-400 Russian air defense battery back in August 2023. Various Ukrainian Telegram channels cited anonymous sources saying that the Neptune was used to hit a Russian ammunition depot in Rostov Oblast on Jan. 11. But evidence of Neptunes flying is largely limited to government statements or citations of unnamed officials. That is despite Zelensky touting that the Neptune had been &#x201C;accepted into weaponry&#x201D; in a speech to Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament all the way back in 2020. &#x201C;There were discussions that Ukraine would set up production for at least the anti-ship cruise missiles,&#x201D; says Hoffmann. &#x201C;Initially we heard that they were very artisanaly producing them &#x2014; just a couple per month at most, but there was not really a production line. But there was this assumption that Ukraine would be able to streamline that to some extent. And that obviously hasn&apos;t happened, at least if we derive it from the rate of usage which really hasn&apos;t seen any kind of uptick since 2023.&#x201D; Distinct from the cruise missile Neptune, the Hrim 2 &#x2014; or Thunder 2 in English &#x2014; is a ballistic rocket program, based on solid fuel and inertial guidance and in theory reaching speeds several times that of sound. Unlike a cruise missile, a ballistic missile goes far into the atmosphere, with many traveling at speeds many times that of sound. The program goes back as far as 2006 under the name Sapsan, which at some point became the internal name, as opposed to the envisioned international export model, the Hrim 2. Ukrainian officials said that the Hrim 2 finally passed testing toward the end of 2024, with Zelensky announcing &#x201C;positive results&#x201D; in August. The head of the permanent Ukrainian delegation to NATO, Yehor Cherniev, said of the Hrim 2s in October: &#x201C;Here, believe me, there will soon be concrete results that not only Ukraine, but the Russian Federation will see.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m seeing test launch claims from last year but, eh,&#x201D; says Michael Duitsman, a missile specialist at the Middlebury Institute in California, doubtfully, about the Hrim 2. Two projects, the Korshun and Vilcha &#x2014; respectively a cruise missile and multiple-launch rocket system &#x2014; were the subject of extensive press speculation in the mid- to late-2010s. The Korshun was a cruise missile, a scale model of which was getting dragged around weapons conferences a decade ago. Despite being a cruise missile, one pro-Russian Telegram channel in 2017 named it as the basis for the Hrim 2. The Korshun project has effectively been shelved since Zelensky&#x2019;s election. The Vilcha is an updated Soviet rocket complex that promised to use modernized, Ukrainian-made rockets with higher precision than its predecessor. Despite appearing in Ukrainian military parades as far back as 2018, there&#x2019;s been no evidence of a functional system playing a role since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine-made Trembita cruise missile. (mil.in.ua)In the same speech in which he promised &#x201C;concrete results&#x201D; for the Hrim 2, Cherniev noted certain components of the Vilcha that &#x201C;unfortunately, we won&#x2019;t be able to get quickly,&#x201D; without specifying what those components were. Various other projects like the volunteer-based &#x201C;Trembita&#x201D; are described as &#x201C;cruise missiles,&#x201D; including in reports from the Economist and the Telegraph, but have nowhere near the speed, range, or payload to merit that title as it is generally understood, maxing out at 400 kilometers/hour, 200 kilometers, and 20 kilograms in each field, respectively.. &#x201C;If you throw a rock fast enough you can call it a missile,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a former naval architect and CIA officer in Eastern Europe, currently consulting on drone production from Estonia, about the Trembita. The main distinction between making classic cruise or ballistic missiles and, for example, Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;missile-drones,&#x201D; which the Trembita more closely resembles, is that the lighter and slower missile-drones can be made in smaller facilities with a far larger proportion of off-the-shelf commercial components. The production of those more advanced engines, guidance systems, and fuel for more traditional missiles requires bigger permanent facilities and massively more precise engineering. &#x201C;This is like another level of science and engineering and physics,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ukraine does not currently have the military-industrial complex to make missiles. Can they make a good Frankenstein missile? Sure, they can do that, but is it going to take down a Kh-31?&#x201D; Designed during the USSR, the Kh-31 is an air-launched missile that hits Mach 3.5 and still sees regular use in the Russian military. Duitsman for one doesn&#x2019;t think the problem is Ukrainian technological savvy so much as Russian air attacks. &#x201C;Once you get the basic industry down it&#x2019;s not that hard, it just becomes immensely harder when someone is trying to bomb all of your factories.&#x201D; Unlike the small workshops in which Ukrainians can produce drones, the factories involved in missile production are massive and their locations well-known. Many Russians still alive once worked in them during the Soviet Union. For the duration of the war, Russian airstrikes have targeted them avidly. In the first months of the war, Russia blew up a massive stockpile of solid rocket fuel in a chemical plant in Pavlohrad, on the western edge of the Donbas. Following a Dec. 20 attack on Kyiv, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had hit &#x201C;the construction bureau &#x2018;Luch,&#x2019; which has accomplished planning and production of rocket complex &#x2018;Neptune&#x2019; and the land-based guided rocket complex &#x2018;Vilcha.&#x2019;&#x201D; Aircraft engines are displayed at the Motor Sich Aviation Museum in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on July 1, 2022. (Julia Kochetova / Bloomberg via Getty Images)And on Jan. 8, Russia bombarded the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs, resulting in the death of some 13 people and 113 more injured. Among the targeted areas, photos from the national police show damage to a &#x201C;Motor Sich&#x201D; factory that has long produced jet engines, including the MS400 Turbofan engines that at least at some point powered the Neptune. Given such security threats it is not surprising that Ukraine has been secretive in details about its missile program. When reached, a representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, calling it &#x201C;a sensitive subject.&#x201D; Still, little has been seen of these missiles in action, casting great doubt on Ukraine&#x2019;s actual production. Mass use within Russia would almost certainly have ended up on social media via Russians under bombardment. Despite the secrecy, Ukraine is obviously eager to tout successes in these missile programs. The development of a local missile program would allow Ukraine to strike back at Russia directly, freed from Western terms for donated weaponry. Missiles have also become more intangible symbols of independence. Eastern Ukraine was the heartland for much of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s heavy industry. Yuzhnomash in Dnipro was the &#x201C;largest ICBM factory in the world,&#x201D; notes Duitsman. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine&#x2019;s missile production was dismantled and cannibalized. The government has spent 20 years claiming that a rocket renaissance is at hand. Renamed to Pivdenmash &#x2014; a shift from the Russian to Ukrainian word &#x201C;pivden&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;south&#x201D; &#x2014; the same factory remains an epicenter of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons production, including the Hrim itself. As with many such plants, Pivdenmash is a target for Russian missile attacks, including the infamous strike by Russia&#x2019;s new Oreshnik on Nov. 21, an event that had many Western observers wringing their hands over the world&#x2019;s first launch of an ICBM. Ukraine is hardly alone in treating missiles as fonts of national pride. U.S. military sources were positively gleeful in touting the Patriot air defense missile&#x2019;s success in shooting down Russia&#x2019;s hypersonic Kinzhal in May 2023. Russia has often bragged about weapons developments beyond their utility. The Russian Oreshnik that struck Pivdenmash in November, for example, was far less impressive than the headlines it managed to gather, says Duitsman. The Oreshnik, he argues, was a fairly minor adaptation of a prior missile that was touted as novel based on the maker&#x2019;s advertising and President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s sudden desire to cause a stir after the U.S. and U.K. permitted Ukraine to strike some Russian territory. &#x201C;States are not monoliths. Russia does not as a whole choose to pursue different missile programs,&#x201D; says Duitsman. &#x201C;These are the results of conflicting political, military, industrial, and engineering goals. The Oreshnik does not necessarily make sense in a military context. It does make sense in the context of these missile design bureaus and missile production factories wanting a piece of the sweet sweet war money pie.&#x201D; Ukraine seems likewise to be overselling the tangible results of local missile development, Hoffmann says. &#x201C;They have a vested interest in making it look like they&apos;re doing well,&#x201D; as Duitsman puts it.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-ukraines-long-delayed-missile-production-ambitions-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/	2025-01-15T08:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
NATO defense budget could surpass Russia’s tenfold if Europe matches Poland’s spending, Tusk says	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&#x2019;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-budget-could-surpass-russias-tenfold-if-europe-matches-polands-spending-pm-says/	2025-01-15T08:42:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVq_yOXcAAXWBM.jpeg
‘Absolutely unacceptable’ — Appointment of Ukrainian judge who visited occupied Crimea, Russia triggers criticism	The appointment of a Ukrainian judge who visited Russia and occupied Crimea during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine has sparked criticism from the head of the country&#x2019;s main judicial watchdog. The High Council of Justice, Ukraine&apos;s top judicial governing body, appointed Oleksandra Shulika as a judge of Kirovohrad Oblast&apos;s Onufriivka District Court on Jan. 14. The decision highlights the continued presence of officials with ties to Russia in the Ukrainian government. While some officials with Russian passports and other links to Russia have been fired, others remain in their positions. Ukraine has a constitutional ban on judges and other officials with foreign passports. Shulika went to Crimea in 2014 after its illegal annexation by Russia and visited Russia several times from 2015 to 2019. &quot;This is absolutely unacceptable,&quot; Mykhailo Zhernakov, executive director of the judicial watchdog the Dejure Foundation, wrote in a post on Facebook. &#x201C;Not only do they help representatives of the judicial mafia remain in their positions but also allow sympathizers of Russia to take vacant positions in the judicial system,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&apos;s judiciary is still notoriously corrupt despite repeated attempts to reform it, according to watchdogs. Some Ukrainian judges have routinely obstructed justice and blocked reforms. &#x201C;How do you like this &apos;reformed&apos; body? And what do you think &#x2014; will they let us into the EU with this kind of system?&quot; The High Council of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Zhernakov said the appointment of judges who visited Russia and the occupied territories during the war violates the High Council of Justice&apos;s own guidelines. This is not the first scandal around a judge with ties to Russia. Bohdan Lvov, a former deputy chairman of the Supreme Court, received Russian citizenship in 1999 and still had a valid Russian passport, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes investigation project reported in 2022. Schemes cited official information from Russia&#x2019;s Federal Tax Service and leaked documents from Russia&#x2019;s official passport database. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later confirmed that Lvov had Russian citizenship. Vsevolod Knyazev, then head of the Supreme Court, fired Lvov in October 2022 due to a constitutional ban on judges having foreign citizenship. The Kyiv District Administrative Court issued a ruling in January 2024 to reinstate Lvov as a Supreme Court judge. The court claimed that there was not enough proof of Lvov&#x2019;s Russian citizenship. In June 2024, an appellate court reversed the ruling and rejected Lvov&apos;s lawsuit for reinstatement.	https://kyivindependent.com/appointment-of-judge-who-visited-occupied-crimea-russia-triggers-criticism/	2025-01-15T07:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-479350285.jpg
Polish PM accuses Russia of planning 'air terror,' condemns sabotage efforts	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15 accused Russia of planning terrorist attacks against international airlines, including in Poland. &quot;Russia has been planning air terror &#x2014; not only against Poland but also against airlines around the world,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s remarks come after a Jan. 14 New York Times report claiming the outgoing U.S. administration warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt intelligence operations involving planting incendiary devices on U.S.-bound cargo planes. &quot;These acts of sabotage are versions of the war that Russia has declared to the whole world, not just Ukraine. They require joint action, and Poland plays a key role in countering such threats,&quot; Tusk said. U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted communications in August 2024 among Russian secret service officers discussing plots to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024, where several parcels sent by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. Had these fires occurred mid-flight, they could have resulted in catastrophic crashes. U.S. media reported these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly raised alarm among White House officials. Zelensky traveled to Poland to meet Tusk after reaching a &quot;breakthrough&quot; agreement over World War II exhumations, a long-standing source of tension between the nations. The leaders emphasized shared efforts to counter Russian aggression and address regional security challenges. Zelensky and Tusk last met in December 2024 in Lviv to discuss historical reconciliation, including issues surrounding the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-accuses-russia-of-planning-global-airline-terror-attacks-condemns-sabotage-efforts/	2025-01-15T06:23:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
Ukraine brings back 25 people from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders	Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. Bringing our people home is what Ukraine is constantly working on, and we will not stop until we bring all of our people back. Today, 25 more of our people are returning home to Ukraine. These are our military and civilians. Among them are the defenders of Mariupol and&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/wDMeTUxYK0 The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude for the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-25-people-from-russian-captivity-including-azovstal-defenders/	2025-01-15T05:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-15-at-15_18_38.png
Strongest action possible' — Albanese vows to act if Australian fighting for Ukraine was executed by Russia	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; during a Jan. 15 press conference if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed, CNN reported. Oscar Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne, was reported captured by Russian forces in December. Ukrainian sources told 7News that Jenkins&apos; body had been found, suggesting he was executed by his captors. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to demand information and stress compliance with international law. Albanese said his government seeks &quot;urgent clarification&quot; and described the reports as &quot;gravely concerning.&quot; &quot;If there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible,&quot; Albanese said, as reported by CNN. He did not specify potential actions Canberra might take. In late December, Russian Telegram channels circulated a video showing Jenkins in military fatigues, interrogated and beaten by his captors. Jenkins is seen providing his name and background as the interrogators question his desire to live. Jenkins introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who came to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, located approximately 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv, and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) and prohibit executions, which are classified as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly been accused of violating these laws by summarily executing Ukrainian POWs. Moscow, however, labels foreign volunteers as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and denies them the protections afforded to POWs under international law. If confirmed, Jenkins&apos; execution would mark the first instance of an Australian volunteer fighter captured and executed by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began. At least six Australians are believed to have been killed fighting for Ukraine. The Australian government and Ukrainian authorities continue to investigate Jenkins&apos; fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/strongest-action-possible-pm-albanese-pledges-action-if-australian-fighting-for-ukraine-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-15T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
Putin's war economy is running on fumes as inflation and shortages surge	Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently boasts about the strength of his country&#x2019;s economy, claiming that Western sanctions only made it stronger (while in the same breath demanding that they be lifted). In fact, &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; &#x2014; inflation combined with minimal growth &#x2014; is coming to Russia. His war on Ukraine has caused both high and rising prices and labor shortages, because many workers have been mobilized or killed, while many others have fled the country. Heading into the Russian Central Bank&#x2019;s regularly scheduled board meeting in late December, most observers expected monetary authorities to raise the policy rate from 21% to 23%. Yet the Russian Central Bank kept the rate unchanged, despite an increase in the official annual inflation figure, from 8.4% to 9.5% in the space of two months. It is easy to guess what happened. Just a day before, Putin said he had spoken with Russian Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina, and it is safe to assume that he told her to leave the policy rate where it is. Any illusion about the Russian Central Bank&apos;s independence vanished. For the first time, Putin appears to have listened to Russia&#x2019;s oligarchs rather than the professional economists overseeing monetary policy. In the last couple of months, numerous top loyalists and businessmen &#x2014; from Sergei Chemezov of Rostec (defense production) and Igor Sechin of Rosneft (oil) to Alexander Shokin of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs &#x2014; have bitterly complained that high interest rates will drive many companies into bankruptcy. These warnings are not unfounded. Since the Russian government ended mortgage subsidies last July, sales of newly built properties have plummeted by around 50%, pushing Russia&#x2019;s two biggest real-estate developers, Samolet and PIK, to the brink of insolvency. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s official inflation figure becomes less credible by the day. According to the independent research firm ROMIR, the average cost of a Russian basket of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as food and household chemicals, had risen by 22.1% year on year in September. The company has published no new inflation readings since. It is easy to guess why. Oil storage tanks are illuminated at night at the RN-Tuapsinsky refinery, operated by Rosneft Oil Co., in Tuapse, Russia, on March 22, 2020. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)To be sure, the FMCG price index does not reflect overall consumer inflation, since it does not track the prices of durable goods and services, which have risen less sharply compared to food prices. Yet there can be little doubt that the official Russian price index figure is too low. We might not know whether inflation is 12% or 22%, but we can be quite confident that it is higher than 9.5%. Even at Putin&#x2019;s own highly choreographed annual press conference last month, inflation was the dominant concern. Russia&#x2019;s inflation is not overtly caused by fiscal profligacy. On the contrary, the Kremlin has long maintained budget surpluses (though it did register a small budget deficit of around 2% of GDP in 2022 and 2023, and it is likely to do so again in 2024). The Russia expert and former banker Craig Kennedy, however, has recently uncovered evidence that since mid-2022, the Kremlin has been strong-arming Russian banks to lend to war-related businesses on preferential terms. This off-budget financing scheme has contributed to a $415 billion surge in corporate borrowing, boosting inflation and rendering Russia&#x2019;s finances highly vulnerable. For a normal country, a budget deficit of 2% of GDP would be of no concern. But Russia is not a normal country. It has been the subject of Western financial sanctions since July 2014, and these have been quite effective at blocking access to international financing. Russia&#x2019;s total private and public foreign debt has fallen from $729 billion at the end of 2013 to $293 billion at the end of September 2024. Yet nobody &#x2014; including Chinese state banks &#x2014; dares to lend it money. Starved of financing, Russia has raised taxes substantially this year. Abandoning the 13% flat income tax established in 2000, it has introduced a progressive income tax system with rates starting at 15% and rising to 22% for top earners. Meanwhile, the tax rate on corporate profits has increased from 20% to 25%. But since these changes will generate only around 1.4% of GDP more in state revenues, the rest of the deficit must be financed with domestic bonds whose interest rates have already skyrocketed, doubling the cost of debt service as a share of total expenditure since 2019. Russia thus remains dependent on a single source of financing: the National Wealth Fund, whose liquid reserves have fallen from $117 billion in 2021 to $31 billion at the end of November. That is only enough to finance three-quarters of the budget deficit in 2025. Western financial sanctions have also weighed on the ruble, which has sunk from 34 to the dollar in 2013 to 103 today. This, too, aggravates inflation, because the central bank no longer has the reserves to defend the exchange rate (by spending dollars to buy rubles). Though Russia has stopped publishing most of its foreign-trade statistics, the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economics (whose scientific council I chair) estimates that its total exports plummeted by 28% (to $425 billion) from 2022 to 2023. Most likely, they remained at the same level in 2024, because Western energy sanctions had not been significantly tightened, although the outgoing Biden administration did so on January 10. At the same time, tighter Western technology sanctions have had devastating effects on Russian manufacturing. Of the 108 airliners Russia planned to build since 2022, only seven have been completed. Dire conditions in the civilian sector presumably extend to the armaments sector, which is largely monopolized by Chemezov&#x2019;s corrupt Rostec. Strained by these factors, the Russian economy is approaching its moment of truth. Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the Russian state cannot afford large bailouts. Business leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage of labor &#x2014; and soldiers &#x2014; is reaching a crisis stage. The most critical shortage, however, is budget financing, as Russia&#x2019;s last liquid reserves are likely to run out in the fall of 2025. Budget cuts will then become necessary. In the meantime, the war economy might also require price controls and rationing &#x2014; the old Soviet sins. As the risk of a financial crash rises, Russia&#x2019;s imperiled economy is about to pose serious constraints on Putin&#x2019;s war. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Lithuania would consider troop deployment to Ukraine upon Kyiv’s request, FM Budrys says	Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&#x2019;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&#x2019;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine.

Russian attacks against Ukraine wound at least 16, kill 1 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded 16 and killed one person over the past day, regional authorities, and the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on Jan. 15. Eight people, including two children were injured in Donetsk Oblast, the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on its Telegram channel, when the Russian military struck a multi-storey building in Kramatorsk. On the night of January 14-15 the Russian military attacked Ukraine with one Iskander-M/KN ballistic missile, seven Kh-22/32, 27 Kh-101/Kh-55 and four Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. During the overnight attack, Russia also launched 74 Shahed-type and various other types of dummy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 23 Kh-101/Kh-55 and three Kalibr cruise missiles, along with Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. They also downed 47 drones, while 27 other drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. The missiles hit critical infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts, with no reports of casualties. A 52-year-old man died, and a 74-year-old woman was injured during Russian attacks on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. Seven were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the city of Kherson and 36 other settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-wound-at-least-16-kill-1-over-past-day/	2025-01-15T04:27:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVGQqmXkAAx1mF.jpeg
Transnistria to receive Russian gas as humanitarian aid, head of breakaway region says	Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, the head of the Moscow-controlled breakaway region said on Jan. 15, but those to the rest of Moldova will remain cut off. Vadim Krasnoselsky made the announcement in a statement after returning from a trip to Moscow, where he attended talks at Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Energy. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. &quot;Gas supplies for the needs of Transnistrians and the functioning of the economy of Transnistria will be restored in the format of providing humanitarian and technical assistance to the republic,&quot; Krasnoselsky said. He did not provide technical details nor a timeline for the restoration of gas flows. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-to-receive-russian-gas-humanitarian-aid/	2025-01-15T03:37:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2043777119.jpg

Biden team seeks European support to leverage frozen Russian assets in talks with Moscow, CNN reports	As the Biden administration prepares to leave office, it is reportedly urging European partners to support the transfer of frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion to a special account as leverage in negotiations with Moscow, CNN reported on Jan. 15, citing anonymous administration officials. The strategy reportedly aims to pressure Moscow by signaling the funds could only be reclaimed through negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;If you want to get this money, you will have to negotiate,&quot; a source told CNN. The proposal involves moving the frozen assets, currently held primarily in European banks, to a deposit account from which withdrawals would only be allowed as part of a future peace deal with Ukraine. Biden officials are reportedly discussing the plan with President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team, including Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, and incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Both reportedly back the initiative, aligning with Trump&apos;s goal to expedite a resolution to the war. European governments have reportedly expressed hesitancy about the plan, citing concerns over its compliance with international law. Confiscation of frozen Russian funds has been a contentious issue, and even using the assets&apos; annual income &#x2014; around $3.2 billion &#x2014; required significant negotiation. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50 billion G7 loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying he did &quot;all I could to help&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump. As the U.S. transitions to a new administration, the international community&apos;s stance on utilizing these assets may significantly influence diplomatic efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-seeks-european-support-to-leverage-frozen-russian-assets-in-talks-with-moscow-cnn-reports/	2025-01-15T03:12:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukrainians divided over what peace with Russia should look like, new poll reveals	There is no clear consensus among Ukrainians about what a potential peace agreement with Russia should look like, a new global poll published on Jan. 15 has found. The poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), presented respondents with four options relating to NATO/EU membership, security guarantees, and ceding/regaining occupied territories. Not one gained a majority for or against from respondents. (European Council on Foreign Relations)&quot;Such disagreements could stoke political turmoil if and when negotiations begin,&quot; the report reads. Though peace negotiations are a long way off, the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has accelerated discussion of their possibility in Kyiv, Moscow, and capitals around the world. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The wide-ranging, global poll surveyed respondents in 16 European countries including the U.K., Russia, and Ukraine, and eight non-European countries including Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. about attitudes towards the U.S. and international powers ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Many of the questions related to Trump&apos;s possible influence on global events such as the wars in Ukraine, and the Middle East, as well as the future balance of global power. In Ukraine, expectations of an outright victory in the war against Russia have fallen sharply in just the last six months since the poll was last conducted, from 58% in May 2024, to 34% in November 2024. Of the options available, most Ukrainians &#x2014; 47% &#x2014; now say a compromise settlement with Russia is the most likely outcome of the war. (European Council on Foreign Relations)Ukrainians are split on whether or not the incoming Trump administration will make peace more or less likely &#x2014; 39% say it will be more likely, 35% less likely, and 26% say it will make no difference. (European Council on Foreign Relations)The question is still largely hypothetical &#x2014; despite multiple promises during the U.S. presidential election campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected, Donald Trump is yet to lay out any concrete plans of how he intends to do so. Tempering expectations further, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, earlier this month said Trump wants to end the war in 100 days. Then there is the issue of what Trump will demand from both sides. While much of the election rhetoric from Trump and his allies suggested Kyiv could be forced to pay a heavy price and cede territory, Kellogg has also sought to play this down. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; As for the global implications of a second Trump presidency, and how he deals with issues such as the war in Ukraine, the poll found a wide range of views across the countries polled. In India, China, and Brazil, majorities or pluralities believe Trump will be a &quot;good thing&quot; for prospects of peace around the world, as well as for their own countries. But in countries more allied with the U.S. there was skepticism &#x2014; only 24% of those in the UK, 31% in South Korea, and 34% in the EU countries polled said Trump&apos;s presidency would make peace in Ukraine more likely, while even fewer thought the same about the Middle East. The authors of the report suggested that while there is obviously a nervousness in Europe about Trump, there is also an opportunity for Europe to reassert itself on the global stage. &quot;Europe may stand almost alone in a Trumpian world, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean we Europeans are powerless to act,&quot; historian Timothy Garton Ash said, adding: &quot;There are opportunities in this new, transactional space for alliances and influence. &quot;Indeed, the very fact that the EU is held in such high regard by people in so many countries and is even expected to grow in strength in the coming decade, should give leaders hope that there is room for a strong and independent-minded Europe in the world.&quot; The poll was conducted in November 2024 in 16 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, T&#xFC;rkiye, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), and eight non-European countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and the United States). The total number of respondents was 28,549.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-divided-over-what-peace-with-russia-should-look-like-new-poll-reveals/	2025-01-15T02:45:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191058089.jpg
‘We know how the good guy is’ — Trump’s defense nominee grilled over war in Ukraine	President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for defense secretary was grilled over the war in Ukraine during a confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, after he failed to mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. Speaking to the Armed Services Committee, Pete Hegseth was asked if the omission was &quot;code for &apos;we&#x2019;re going to abandon Ukraine.&apos;&quot; &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegesth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he added. The Armed Services Committee is expected to vote on Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation as soon as Monday, Reuters reports. He will then be considered by the full U.S. Senate. Hegseth&#x2019;s nomination in November sent shockwaves through Pentagon corridors, with officials anonymously questioning his qualifications to lead the department. He would lead 1.3 million troops and over 750,000 civilians, preside over a $850 billion budget, and hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. A former conservative talk show host on Fox News, Hegesth is seen as an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance. He previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. Following his discharge from the army, he became head of the conservative organization Concerned Veterans for America and, in June 2024, released a book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Hegseth also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-know-how-the-good-guy-is-trumps-defense-nominee-grilled-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-15T01:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 9	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 9 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 6&#x2013;12, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament pushes forward draft law at odds with IMF requirements Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, rejected draft law #12368, submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers, which aimed to establish a High Administrative Court. Instead, lawmakers backed an alternative proposal, draft law #12368-1, introduced by MP Vlasenko of the Batkivshchyna faction, in its first reading. This version designates the Kyiv City District Administrative Court to handle cases concerning the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office competitions and audits. For appeals it proposes to establish a separate Kyiv City Appeal Administrative Court. This move diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund&apos;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Parliament set to vote public investment management bill During sessions scheduled for Jan. 14-17, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada will review draft law #12245 on public investment management in its second and final reading. The Budget Committee approved it on Monday morning. This legislation is crucial for meeting a structural benchmark under the MEFP, with a deadline at the end of January 2025. Transparency International Ukraine has flagged concerns over recent amendments that grant the Cabinet of Ministers authority to increase salaries for State Audit Service employees and assign special ranks and statuses to the SAS. Parliament to vote on draft law to repeal &quot;Lozovyy Amendments,&quot; rejection likely The Verkhovna Rada is set to consider a revised draft law #12367 amending the Criminal Procedure Code in its first reading. This government-backed legislation aims to fulfill obligations related to repealing the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; and addressing the implications of expired pre-trial investigation time limits. Our information indicates a significant risk of rejection when it comes to a vote. The Law Enforcement Committee hasn&#x2019;t decided on the draft law during its meeting on Jan. 13. It is more likely that MPs will submit an alternative bill. Ukraine advances energy sector commitments The Verkhovna Rada has adopted draft law #12131, reinstating monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, fulfilling a key requirement under the Ukraine Plan. The deadline for this measure was set for the end of the second quarter of 2025. Corporate governance reform sees progress Parliament has passed draft law #6013, mandating corporate governance standards across utility and state-owned enterprises. In particular, these companies will have to sell assets via &#x201C;Prozorro.Sales&#x201D; and publish financial reports. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers approved new procedures for evaluating the performance of supervisory boards in SOEs. Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, noted that this includes mandatory performance assessments for the boards of Ukrenergo, Naftogaz, and the Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSO) for the previous year. The reform aims to ensure supervisory board independence and adherence to OECD corporate governance principles, requiring annual submission of development and performance reports by the end of March.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-9/	2025-01-15T01:19:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
Zelensky to visit Poland after ‘breakthrough’ agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Poland on Jan 15 to meet with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Reuters reported, after a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; agreement was reached between the two countries in a long-running dispute over World War II exhumations. The Volyn massacre involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. Tusk announced on Jan. 10 that a decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. &quot;There are a lot of topics (to discuss), including of course exhumations,&quot; a Polish government official was quoted as saying by Reuters. &quot;What interests us is the way these decisions (about exhumations) are carried out.&quot; They added the two leaders would hold a joint press conference in Poland. According to Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, exhumations will begin as early as April 2025. Zelensky and Tusk previously met in Lviv in December 2024, to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &#x201C;History certainly cannot divide us,&#x201D; he said in December 2024. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-poland-after-breakthrough-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations/	2025-01-14T23:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 15. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,780 tanks, 20,348 armored fighting vehicles, 33,995 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,975 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,046 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,383 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-812-670-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-14T22:50:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, launching Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; There are no reports of casualties or damage at this time. Shortly after eight in the morning, the all clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraine/	2025-01-14T22:42:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
US, Armenia sign strategic partnership agreement	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan signed a strategic partnership commission charter between the U.S and Armenia on Jan. 14 in Washington, D.C. The agreement comes as Armenia, once a close ally of Russia, moves to strengthen ties with the West amid deteriorating relations with Moscow. The charter establishes a framework for expanded bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Armenia in the areas of economic cooperation, security and defense, and democracy, among others. &quot;We are increasingly strong partners, and I think that is for the good of both of our countries as well as the good of the region and beyond,&quot; Blinken said at the signing. The two countries are also preparing to start negotations on an agreement to support Armenia&apos;s nuclear energy sector, Blinken said. &quot;Our relations, based on shared values and mutual interests, have witnessed remarkable growth in recent years,&quot; Mirzoyan said. &#xA0; &quot;They have matured to a point where upgrading them to a strategic partnership is not only fitting but essential for navigating the complex geopolitical landscape.&quot; The strategic partnership marks Armenia&apos;s latest pro-Western foreign policy move as it continues to distance itself from Russia, its traditional ally. Relations between Russia and Armenia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. Yerevan has since forged deeper alliances with the U.S. and Europe, signaling interest in joining the EU and breaking from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led security alliance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-armenia-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-14T20:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/armenia.png
EU considering ban on Russian LNG, aluminum, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is considering a gradual ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials. The EU has begun drafting its 16th round of sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bloc aims to approve the package on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the all-out war. The phase-out of Russian LNG could be enacted as a sanction or part of a road map presented by the European Commission next month, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. Restrictions on aluminum would be gradual, with a time frame yet to be determined. The new sanctions may also target dozens of vessels belonging to Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; tankers that transport Russian oil products in violation of international sanctions &#x2014; and cut more banks off from the SWIFT international payment system, Bloomberg&apos;s sources said. The draft measures are currently under discussion and subject to change before they are formally presented. The EU is still debating whether to impose restrictions on Russian LNG via sanctions or as a set of regulations within a road map, or a combination thereof, undisclosed officials and diplomats said. Sanctions, which may carry the most weight, require unanimous approval of all member states. This requirement has prevented the EU from banning Russian pipeline gas, as member nations such as Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia. The EU&apos;s largest importers of Russian LNG &#x2014;&#xA0;Spain, Belgium, and France &#x2014;&#xA0;are not expected to block sanctions against Moscow, the officials said. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed replacing Russian LNG with U.S. imports in a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in November. The 16th sanctions package comes on the heels of a joint U.S.-U.K. crackdown on Russia&apos;s oil sector and shadow fleet. The two countries on Jan. 10 imposed major restrictions on over 180 Russian tankers and a number of oil companies. Following the sanctions, 65 oil tankers around the world paused operations and remain idling offshore.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ban-on-russian-lng-aluminum-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T18:50:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Drone hits distillery in Russia's Tambov Oblast, local media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone struck a distillery in the village of Novaya Lyada in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast the night of Jan. 14, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. Local residents said a fire broke out at the distillery, which is located near a military training ground. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack at the distillery. The government of Tambov Oblast claimed that air defense units intercepted a drone over the region and that it exploded &quot;in a tree.&quot; Previous drone attacks have reportedly targeted Russian alcohol plants, including facilities in Tambov Oblast. The Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo in Tambov Oblast allegedly caught fire after being struck by a drone in October 2025. The distillery advertised its manufacture of &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; including ethanol, a solvent used in the production of explosives. The reported attack on Novaya Lyada comes a day after Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities, covering a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), overnight on Jan. 13-14. Ukrainian forces successfully struck chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-hits-distillery-in-russias-tambov-oblast-local-media-reports/	2025-01-14T17:47:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/distillery.png
Putin aide claims that 'Moldova will become part of another state or cease to exist', Chisinau responds	Moldovan officials have condemned recent remarks by Nikolai Patrushev, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that Moldova &#x201C;will either become part of another state or cease to exist&#x201D; due to its &#x201C;anti-Russian policy,&#x201D; Moldovan media outlet NewsMaker reported on January 14. Patrushev made the controversial statement in an interview, further blaming the Moldovan government for the energy crisis and urging Chisinau to &quot;not deceive itself or its people,&quot; but instead &quot;admit its mistakes and start fixing the situation.&quot; Moldova&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry called the remarks unnaceptable interference in the internal affairs of the country. &#x201C;Moldova is a sovereign state that stands firmly on the path of democracy and European integration, in line with the will of its citizens,&#x201D; the Foreign Ministry said. The energy crisis, worsened by Russia&apos;s suspension of gas supplies in December 2024, has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. Moldova began sourcing electricity from European markets, resulting in significant disruptions in the Russian-controlled Transnistria region, including power outages and industrial shutdowns. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms.

Zelensky addresses personnel transfer controversy, orders Air Force commander not to reassign specialists to Ground Forces	President Volodymyr Zelensky has addressed the controversy surrounding the reassignment of Air Force personnel to the Ground Forces, in his evening address on Jan. 14. Reports indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. The latest directive was issued on Jan. 11, when Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. However, this move has sparked significant debate and concern about its impact on the Air Force&#x2019;s operational capabilities. Zelensky directed Anatolii Kryvonozhko, Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, to ensure the Air Force maintains its required personnel levels and to address public concerns about recent transfers to the Ground Forces. &quot;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments. I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2013; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units,&#x201D; he said. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also weighed in, reassuring the public that critical engineering and aviation specialists servicing aircraft are not being transferred. Instead, selected Air Force personnel are undergoing training to address personnel shortages in infantry and other units.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-personnel-transfer-controversy-orders-air-force-commander-not-to-reassign-specialists-to-ground-forces/	2025-01-14T14:02:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Slovak opposition announces no-confidence vote against PM	Slovakia&apos;s pro-Western opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction, TASR news agency reported on Jan. 14. The opposition &#x2014; Progressive Slovakia, Freedom and Solidarity, the Christian Democrats, and others &#x2014; criticized Fico for undermining Slovakia&apos;s pro-European stance and failing to address domestic issues such as healthcare, rising prices, and administrative inefficiencies. Opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia accused Fico of steering Slovakia toward pro-Russian policies. &quot;Fico has left Slovakia,&quot; Simecka said, referencing the prime minister&apos;s recent travels, including a controversial visit to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly stance has drawn widespread criticism, with accusations that he prioritizes ties with autocratic regimes over Slovakia&apos;s Western alliances. Protests erupted in Slovakia&apos;s capital on Jan. 3, with thousands chanting pro-EU slogans and condemning Fico&apos;s policies. The opposition has criticized Fico&apos;s domestic governance, accusing him of neglecting pressing national issues while alienating Slovakia from its Western allies. &quot;We will not allow Fico to turn Slovakia eastward,&quot; Simecka said, as reported by Aktuality. Efforts to convene an extraordinary parliamentary session to reaffirm Slovakia&apos;s foreign policy orientation failed due to a lack of coalition support. The opposition now plans to use the no-confidence vote as a platform to challenge Fico&apos;s policies and leadership. Relations between Slovakia and Ukraine have deteriorated after Kyiv allowed a pre-war Russian gas transit deal to expire on Dec. 31, 2024. In retaliation, Fico threatened to reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees and cut electricity exports to Ukraine. Before Fico&apos;s government took power, Slovakia had been a leading supporter of Ukraine, delivering military aid and fighter jets. Fico&apos;s administration reversed this policy, halting arms shipments and adopting rhetoric critical of the West&apos;s role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Public dissatisfaction with Fico&apos;s policies has been growing, as demonstrated by the Bratislava protests. Demonstrators carried Slovak and EU flags, played the EU anthem, and displayed banners like &quot;We are Europe&quot; and &quot;Fico, go to Moscow, leave Slovakia in peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-announces-no-confidence-vote-against-pm-fico-criticizing-pro-russian-stance/	2025-01-14T13:08:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine targets Russian industrial plants, ammunition depots in overnight strike	Key developments on Jan. 14: Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles. It also carries out overhauls of Grad, Uragan, and Tornado-G MLRS. The unit reported that the drones distracted Russian air defense, paving the way for missiles to hit the main targets. Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure. In Tatarstan&#x2019;s capital, Kazan, a fuel facility was struck in the early hours of Jan. 14, igniting a gas tank. The fire occurred about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Tatarstan Republic head Rustam Minnikhanov confirmed that a fire broke out in the city as a result of the drone strike but claimed that it resulted in no significant damage. &quot;I went to the scene of a fire that occurred as a result of the drone attack. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. I heard reports that there were no casualties or serious damage,&quot; Minnikhanov wrote on his Telegram channel. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine&apos;s immediate focus is on adequately equipping its military, rather than further reducing the draft age, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 14, according to Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;When we talk about increasing the number of our people (in the military), we must first address the issue of adequately equipping our brigades. Our partners have all these requests,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky noted that Ukraine fields over 100 brigades, all requiring sustained staffing and consistent resupply of equipment to maintain their combat effectiveness. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has reportedly advocated for the move as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. However, Kyiv has resisted the proposal, citing concerns over equipment shortages and the economic impact of drafting younger workers. Under martial law, men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but only those aged 25 and older are eligible for the draft. The Ukrainian government lowered the draft age from 27 to 25 in April 2024, adding 50,000 troops to its forces. While the measure bolstered numbers, it fell short of meeting the military&apos;s full requirements. The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. In a Jan. 14 statement, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied transferring Air Force engineering and aviation personnel to infantry units, emphasizing that technical and flight personnel numbers are increasing. However, some Air Force and other branch personnel, after training, are being reassigned to strengthen ground brigades due to a critical infantry shortage. The General Staff noted this as a necessary measure to bolster frontline defense but confirmed that specialists in high-tech roles or those trained abroad on foreign equipment are exempt from transfers. Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace. Pistorius called Rzeszow a key logistics hub for Ukraine and said he would personally ensure that the U.S.-made air defenses begin operating by the end of the month. The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that the airport is also a key conduit for humanitarian support heading to Ukraine, adding that more than 90% of all allied aid flows through it. Currently, a NASAMS air defense system protects the airport, which is manned by Norwegian soldiers. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-targets-russian-industrial-plants-ammunition-depots-in-overnight-strike/	2025-01-14T12:12:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-14-at-12_47_35-PM.png
Seoul to consult with Kyiv on transfer of captured North Korean soldiers, Yonhap reports	Seoul plans to hold consultations with Kyiv regarding the transfer of captured North Korean soldiers if they request defection, Yonhap reported on Jan. 14, citing South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;Since North Korean soldiers are our citizens under the constitution, our government plans to have talks with Ukraine if they ask to defect to South Korea,&quot; Lee said. The South Korean constitution defines the entire Korean peninsula as its territory and considers all residents as citizens. However, neither of the captured soldiers has expressed a willingness to be transferred to South Korea, Lee added. Seoul remains in contact with Kyiv on matters related to the captured North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-to-consult-with-kyiv-on-transfer-of-captured-north-korean-soldiers-yonhap-reports/	2025-01-14T12:09:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35--3-.jpg
Biden leaves nearly $4 billion in US aid to Ukraine unused. What will happen to them under Trump?	U.S. President Joe Biden will be passing around $3.8 billion in the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to his successor &#x2014; Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for providing Ukraine with military assistance, including through military shipments using the PDA. Countering Trump&apos;s rhetoric, the outgoing administration stated its desire to use the available funds to help Kyiv withstand the ongoing Russian offensive in the country&apos;s east. &quot;We are determined &#x2014; and it&apos;s fully my intent and the president&apos;s (Joe Biden) intent &#x2014; to spend every cent that we have available from the $61 billion that was authorized by Congress in the supplemental appropriation,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the end of 2024. The Kyiv Independent explains what the Presidential Drawdown Authority is, how it was used, and why the Biden administration failed to use up the funds provided to him by Congress. On Jan. 9, the outgoing president signed into force a military aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million. The aid package was said to be the last one before a new administration takes office on Jan. 20. The last tranche included missiles for air defense, air-to-ground munitions, armored bridging systems, as well as equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s use of F-16 fighter jets. The final aid package from the Biden administration was expected to be much larger, with nearly $4.3 billion in available funding open to the president&apos;s signing at the start of 2025.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)Despite the ongoing attempts to frame Biden&apos;s military aid shipments as a charity, the PDA doesn&apos;t involve actual funds being spent. The PDA allows Washington to supply Ukraine with military equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles, considered to be surplus, which can begin arriving within days of approval. The sums showing up in White House reports are an estimated value of the equipment provided and shipped to the recipient country. Concerns over the fact that Biden&apos;s administration won&apos;t be able to provide the promised funding arose months prior. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the crucial foreign aid package, which included around $61 billion for Ukraine, in April 2024. The bill was first introduced in October 2023, yet was delayed for months due to political infighting in the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress. Following Trump&apos;s election victory, the Biden administration rushed military aid shipments to Ukraine. Soon, the U.S. aid packages to Kyiv shrank. The Pentagon has reached the limit of weapons it can send to Ukraine monthly without affecting its own combat capability and started facing logistical problems in delivering weapons, the Wall Street Journal reported in late November, citing unnamed U.S. officials. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) published on Jan. 10 that Washington has to balance its own readiness needs, as well as look at what the U.S. do to support Ukraine. Asked again, a few days later, why the U.S. was unable to provide all the PDA authorization to Ukraine, Ryder dodged the question, adding that &quot;the authority will get passed to the next administration and it will be their call on whether they will choose to expend &#x2014; or employ that authority to expend those funds.&quot; &quot;It could be a simple political calculation to avoid leaving the Trump administration with a completely zero balance (in aid to Ukraine),&quot; Vladyslav Faraponov, the head of the Kyiv-based Institute of American Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Rebecca Noble / Getty Images)Meanwhile, Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of the Kyiv-based NGO Anti Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), said that Biden failed to fulfill his promise. She also blamed Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry for not being ready for such a scenario and not persuading the Pentagon to move forward with the promised aid. Kaleniuk told the Kyiv Independent that the ANTAC and other experts had warned the Defense Ministry that Washington would run out of time to spend all the money and that it lacked the necessary military hardware requested by Ukraine, primarily air defense systems and missiles. Kaleniuk suggested that the remaining U.S. funds could have been redirected to other arms assistance programs in case of better cooperation. Kyiv could also expand the list of weapons priorities to include lower-priority equipment that might still be available in stockpiles, she added. &quot;By the time we realized, it was too late,&quot; Kaleniuk said. The Kyiv Independent sent a request for comments to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry but has not received a response at the time of publication. The remaining PDA funds are now at Trump&apos;s disposal. &quot;It&apos;s really up to the incoming administration to decide what they use &#x2014; what they decide to do with the remaining authority that&apos;s left,&quot; Pentagon&apos;s deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Jan. 8. When asked if the Biden administration is concerned about remaining funds and if there is a danger of a lag, she answered that Ukraine has &quot;strong&quot; bipartisan support within Congress. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has committed over $66.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, the Pentagon said. Washington also provides Ukraine with aid through the USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative), a Pentagon-led program that supplies arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. Another program, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), enables Ukraine to purchase weapons and munitions from U.S. defense companies. Under Biden&apos;s administration, Ukraine was provided with the long-awaited High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Patriot air-defense systems, and Abrams battle tanks. But protracted decision-making on the provision of much-needed weapons, such as ATACMS long-range missiles and permission to use the provided missiles against targets deep inside Russia, slowed Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)The holdup on approving U.S. aid in 2024 led to the fall of the key eastern city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, followed by the loss of several other major towns in the region. Faraponov suggests that Trump will use the remaining money, but not immediately. Trump&apos;s administration may utilize it as leverage or as a bargaining chip in potential negotiations. &quot;The decision (to provide Ukraine with more aid) will be less popular with the Republican audience, in particular, who are generally skeptical of all international aid,&quot; he said. &quot;For the Trump administration, it is less risky in terms of reputation to transfer these remaining funds than to promote another aid package in Congress.&quot; Kaleniuk also believes that the remaining $3.8 billion may be used for Ukraine under the Trump administration. &quot;But the change of any administration implies a delay in decision-making. That is why we can get bogged down in their internal political struggle.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-4-billion-in-us-aid-to-ukraine-remained-unused-what-will-happen-to-them/	2025-01-14T12:07:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188625792.jpg
Germany continues talks on $3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Pistorius says	The German government is still discussing a proposed 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) aid package for Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 14, according to Ukrinform. Pistorius, who made an unannounced visit to Kyiv, met with Ukrainian officials to discuss defense industry cooperation, including boosting joint ventures and direct procurement of Ukrainian defense production with European funds. &quot;We have prepared everything we need, but we are still in the process of negotiations within the government because there is still the issue of funds that are not yet available because there is still no budget,&quot; Pistorius said. Pistorius assured that Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine would remain &quot;reliable, unwavering, committed, and energetic&quot; regardless of the outcome of Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 elections. On Jan. 9, Der Spiegel reported that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked an additional military aid package, allegedly arguing that the 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) already allocated for 2025, along with funds from a $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should suffice. Pistorius denied the report, stating that no final decision on the funding had been made. Germany, under Scholz&#x2019;s leadership, has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-government-continues-discussions-on-providing-ukraine-with-aid-worth-3-billion-pistorius-says/	2025-01-14T12:05:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Transnistria head travels to Russia for talks amid energy crisis, Russian state media claims	Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, held talks in Moscow regarding the region&#x2019;s energy crisis, Russian state news agency TASS claimed on Jan. 14, citing sources within Transnistria&apos;s administration. TASS did not specify whom Krasnoselsky met with during his visit. The crisis began when Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-head-travels-to-russia-for-talks-amid-energy-crisis-russian-state-media-claims/	2025-01-14T10:56:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1235528511.jpg
Metinvest suspends operations at Pokrovsk coal mine amid security concerns	Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, has suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages, the company announced on Jan. 14. Located 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk, the mine is one of Eastern Europe&#x2019;s largest and Ukraine&#x2019;s sole producer of coking coal, a key component in steelmaking&#x2014;Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The mine remains under Ukrainian control, and Metinvest is evacuating employees and their families. &quot;The suspension of operations is a necessary step to preserve lives during these challenging times. We believe in Ukraine&apos;s victory and are prepared to resume operations and rebuild Pokrovsk after the Russian invasion is repelled,&quot; said Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov. To sustain steel production at its plants in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Metinvest has developed a contingency plan. This includes sourcing coking coal from the U.S.-based United Coal Company, utilizing existing reserves, and securing additional supplies from third-party vendors. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/metinvest-suspends-operations-at-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-amid-security-concerns/	2025-01-14T10:11:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190947297.jpg
Ukraine denies transferring Air Force personnel to infantry amid troop shortages	The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. In a Jan. 14 statement, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied transferring Air Force engineering and aviation personnel to infantry units, emphasizing that technical and flight personnel numbers are increasing. However, some Air Force and other branch personnel, after training, are being reassigned to strengthen ground brigades due to a critical infantry shortage.

U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has reportedly advocated for the move as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. However, Kyiv has resisted the proposal, citing concerns over equipment shortages and the economic impact of drafting younger workers. Under martial law, men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but only those aged 25 and older are eligible for the draft. The Ukrainian government lowered the draft age from 27 to 25 in April 2024, adding 50,000 troops to its forces. While the measure bolstered numbers, it fell short of meeting the military&#x2019;s full requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/equipping-troops-takes-priority-over-lowering-draft-age-zelensky-says/	2025-01-14T07:22:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
NATO launches Baltic Sea naval operation after undersea infrastructure sabotage	Eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan on Jan. 14 to address risks to underwater infrastructure following recent cases of suspected sabotage. The declaration follows the Dec. 25 sabotage of four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. The plan was announced after a summit co-organized by Finland and Estonia, which included leaders from Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. The summit welcomed NATO&#x2019;s &quot;Baltic Sentry&quot; mission, aimed at monitoring, deterring, and responding to potential threats. Up to 10 NATO vessels will patrol the Baltic Sea until April, enhancing situational awareness and protecting critical undersea infrastructure. The leaders pledged to deter, detect, and respond robustly to any attempts at sabotage, emphasizing that hostile actions would be attributed and countered as appropriate. &quot;We are determined to attribute and counter any actions threatening our infrastructure. Any attack will be met with a robust and determined response,&quot; the statement read. NATO&#x2019;s Maritime Center for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May, will lead efforts to deploy innovative surveillance technologies and develop rapid response mechanisms for repairing damaged infrastructure. The leaders expressed concern over Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, tankers allegedly used for sanction evasion and espionage, which also threaten maritime security. &quot;We reserve our rights, in accordance with international law, to take action against any vessels circumventing sanctions and threatening security, infrastructure, and the environment,&quot; the statement said. A Memorandum of Understanding on Critical Infrastructure Protection will be prepared to coordinate joint efforts. The leaders also agreed to enhance network resilience and readiness for rapid repairs. The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent incidents, including suspicious activity by Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden, have heightened tensions. The summit highlights NATO&#x2019;s commitment to safeguarding the Baltic Sea amid escalating challenges posed by Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-nato-states-unite-in-response-to-underwater-sabotage-including-russian-vessel-involvement/	2025-01-14T06:07:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Germany to deploy Patriot at Poland's key hub for Ukraine aid by end of January	Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace. Pistorius called Rzeszow a key logistics hub for Ukraine and said he would personally ensure that the U.S.-made air defenses begin operating by the end of the month. The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that the airport is also a key conduit for humanitarian support heading to Ukraine, adding that more than 90% of all allied aid flows through it. Currently, a NASAMS air defense system protects the airport, which is manned by Norwegian soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-deploy-patriot-near-polish-hub-for-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-14T05:54:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
Ukraine targets Russia's industrial plants, ammunition depots in 'massive' strike overnight	Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show an attack on Tula Region, Russia, overnight on Jan. 14, 2024. (Baza/Telegram)In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles. It also carries out overhauls of Grad, Uragan, and Tornado-G MLRS. The unit reported that the drones distracted Russian air defense, paving the way for missiles to hit the main targets. Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure. In Tatarstan&#x2019;s capital, Kazan, a fuel facility was struck in the early hours of Jan. 14, igniting a gas tank. The fire occurred about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Tatarstan Republic head Rustam Minnikhanov confirmed that a fire broke out in the city as a result of the drone strike but claimed that it resulted in no significant damage. &quot;I went to the scene of a fire that occurred as a result of the drone attack. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. I heard reports that there were no casualties or serious damage,&quot; Minnikhanov wrote on his Telegram channel. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show a fire rising in Kazan, Tatarstan Republic, Russia, after a drone attack overnight on Jan. 14, 2024. (Mash/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukrainian forces have increasingly targeted Russia&#x2019;s oil industry, ammunition depots, and military airfields, aiming to disrupt supply chains critical to Russia&#x2019;s war efforts. Fossil fuel exports remain a major revenue stream for the Kremlin&#x2019;s military operations. These attacks are part of Ukraine&#x2019;s ongoing efforts to undermine Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion, striking deep into Russian territory, including regions far from the front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-chemical-plants-refineries-warehouses-in-russia/	2025-01-14T05:33:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-14-at-12_20_10_f5c6c958.jpg
Russian FSB officer found dead in Moscow Defense Ministry building, media reports	Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) counterintelligence officer Vladimir Feshchenko was found dead in a Russian Defense Ministry building in Moscow, Russian state-owned outlet RIA Novosti reported on Jan. 14. Preliminary information suggests he was murdered, an undisclosed source told the news agency. The pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Baza also described the death as violent, citing a deep wound in Feshchenko&#x2019;s forehead. The body was discovered in a building on Olkhovskaya Street, which houses the Russian Defense Ministry and the FSB Office for the Moscow Military District. While Baza identified Feshchenko as a Russian weightlifting champion and international master of sports, his status as an FSB officer was not indicated. The Vchk-Ogpu Telegram channel, known for connections to Russian security forces, confirmed his affiliation with the FSB. According to Vchk-Ogpu, Feshchenko was allegedly killed during a conflict with a friend with whom he had previously served in the Far East. The suspect, reportedly detained, has pleaded guilty to the murder. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Russian Justice Ministry has designated Vchk-Ogpu as a &quot;foreign agent,&quot; accusing the Telegram channel of spreading allegedly false information about government decisions and creating a negative image of the Russian military. The FSB has gained notoriety for suppressing dissent, targeting activists, independent journalists, and pro-democracy movements. President Vladimir Putin has also tasked the agency with locating Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine&#x2019;s military or pro-Kyiv militias. Feshchenko&#x2019;s death highlights mounting internal tensions within Russia&#x2019;s security and military institutions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fsb-officer-found-with-fatal-head-wound-in-moscow-defense-ministry-building-media-reports/	2025-01-14T04:57:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1249616715--1-.jpg
Biden's aides warned Putin against Russia's plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes, NYT reports	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s team delivered a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin to put an end to Russian intelligence&apos;s suspected plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes, The New York Times reported on Jan. 14, citing unnamed sources. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024 that saw several parcels sent by individuals catch fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. The fires could have resulted in plane crashes if they had happened during the flight. The U.S. media wrote that these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly alarmed White House officials. U.S. intelligence obtained conversations in August 2024 between Russian secret service officers discussing details of the plan. The White House, uncertain whether the Russian leader knew about the plan, warned Putin through back-channel communication to stop the operation, the outlet wrote. At least five high-ranking Russian officials, including foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin, FSB head Alexander Bortnikov, and presidential advisor Yuriy Ushakov, were contacted to ensure Putin received the Biden administration&#x2019;s warning. The article does not reveal the details or nature of this warning. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in Europe, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague in October 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/bidens-aides-sent-warnings-to-putin-not-to-send-incendiary-parcels-with-cargo-planes-nyt-reports/	2025-01-14T04:49:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Australia making 'urgent inquiries' after reports of volunteer fighter's execution in Russian captivity	Canberra is making &quot;urgent inquiries&quot; about the status of Australian citizen Oscar Jenkins, a volunteer soldier captured by Russia while fighting for &#xA0;Ukraine, after reports of his death, the 7News outlet wrote on Jan. 14. Undisclosed sources in Ukraine told 7News that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He is believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Australian officials are yet to confirm Jenkins&apos; death, while Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to &quot;seek information&quot; and urge Moscow to comply with international law. 7News reported &quot;speculations&quot; that Jenkins&apos; body has been found but is yet to be officially identified, without providing details on the circumstances of the body&apos;s discovery. Ukrainian authorities are said to be working to verify the reports. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response as of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat prisoners of war (POW) with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. A spokesperson of the Australian Foreign Ministry told the local media that the government has &quot;grave concerns for Mr Jenkins&apos;s welfare.&quot; If confirmed, this would be the first Australian volunteer fighter executed in Russian captivity during the full-scale war. At least six other Australians are believed to have been killed while fighting on Ukraine&apos;s side. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Jenkins, who reportedly served in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who wanted to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian city in Donetsk Oblast, around 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as &quot;much loved&quot; by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-making-urgent-inquiries-about-volunteer-fighter/	2025-01-14T04:18:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins.png
Will Transnistria's gas crisis lead to its collapse and reintegration into Moldova?	By halting natural gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, Russia created an unprecedented economic crisis in the Russian-occupied part of the country &#x2014; Transnistria. The crisis prompted a question: will the breakaway region, occupied by Russia since 1992, survive without Russian gas? Free-of-charge Russian gas had been the backbone of Transnistria&apos;s economy and ensured the preservation of the breakaway region and its de facto independence from Moldova. Some argue that the gas crisis may lead to Transnistria&apos;s political collapse and reintegration into Moldova, dealing a blow to Russia&apos;s regional influence. But analysts say that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration is unlikely since it would be too difficult for Moldova to achieve, could provoke Russian aggression against Chisinau or destabilize Moldova by increasing the share of pro-Russian voters. They argue that Moldova has not taken any steps in that direction intentionally. &quot;There are far too many forces and actors in the Republic of Moldova with whose help the Russian Federation will try to prevent a possible effort to reunify the country and reintegrate Transnistria,&quot; Ion Manole, head of Moldovan think-tank Promo-LEX, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The goal of this crisis is to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and bring it under Russia&apos;s total control, and by no means to lose control over the Transnistrian region.&quot; A more likely scenario is that Russia will use the ongoing gas and electricity crisis to destabilize Moldova itself and try to bring pro-Russian parties back into power in the upcoming parliamentary elections set to be held in the second half of 2025. Chisinau has not been buying Russian gas since 2022, but Russian-occupied Transnistria continued to get its gas from Russia until Jan. 1, 2025. The halt in gas deliveries was due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. Transnistria had been effectively acquiring gas free of charge &#x2014; a political tool that Russia used to keep the region under its control. The breakaway region&apos;s debt for Russian gas amounts to more than $10 billion, according to Moldovagaz, a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. Chisinau&apos;s separate debt for Russian gas supplies totals $709 million, according to Gazprom. However, the Moldovan government recognizes only an $8.6 million debt, citing financial audits. Gazprom said on Dec. 28 it would stop its gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 due to its debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 9 blamed Ukraine and Moldova for Transnistria&apos;s gas crisis. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria were without heating and hot water on Jan. 4, and nearly 72,000 homes remained without gas, Transnistria&apos;s unrecognized leader Vadim Krasnoselsky said. Employees attend a security training at Moldovatransgaz&apos;s gas station in Causeni, Moldova on May 3, 2022. (Valeria Mongelli / Bloomberg via Getty Images)The end of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has also halted all industrial activity in Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of Transnistria&apos;s self-proclaimed government, said on Jan. 2. Despite the crisis, Transnistria has rejected Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas from Europe, Vadim Cheban, CEO of Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 3. Transnistria instead expects Russia&apos;s Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas, Cheban said. Russia is technically capable of supplying its gas through pipelines via Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania to Transnistria, but such supplies would have to be approved by Chisinau. The non-occupied part of Moldova has also been affected by the crisis because it had previously bought electricity from Transnistria&apos;s Cuciurgan power station, which used Russian gas as fuel. As a result of the halt in gas supplies, electricity prices in Moldova are rising. Analysts say that the crisis is likely to cause discontent in Transnistria but, due to a lack of opposition, the crisis won&apos;t have any major political consequences inside the occupied region. &quot;No matter how dissatisfied the population may be, it will not lead to an increase in opposition ratings because, in essence, there is no real opposition in Transnistria,&quot; Serhiy Gerasimchuk, a Moldova and Romania expert at the Ukrainian Prism think-tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Anatoly Dirun, a political analyst from Transnistria currently based in Chisinau, also said that &quot;there is no political opposition or alternative political forces (in the breakaway region) that could criticize the current leadership.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to speak of any potential political changes at this point,&quot; he added. The energy crisis in Transnistria prompted speculation that the Russian-controlled entity&apos;s survival is at stake and that it may be forced to reintegrate into Moldova at some point in the future. &quot;The people in Transnistria are realizing that the so-called &apos;government&apos; in Tiraspol cannot ensure basic needs like heating, gas or electricity,&quot; Eugen Muravschi, an associated expert at Chisinau-based watchdogs WatchDog MD and CPR-Moldova, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Naturally, the question will arise &#x2014; what then is the point of this regime?&quot; He argued that the &quot;situation is a big blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the Tiraspol regime, but also to the narrative of Russia as a trustworthy protector.&quot; Manole told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;in the absence of a direct corridor (linking Russia and Transnistria), the possibilities of the Russian Federation to further control and influence the Republic of Moldova through the Transnistrian region have diminished since Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea and virtually disappeared with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&quot; Women pose by decorations in Russian flag colors on Republic Day in Tiraspol, Transnistria, Moldova on Sept. 2, 2023. (Peter Dench / Getty Images)Despite that, analysts argue that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration into Moldova is unlikely. &quot;Questions related to reintegration are currently out of focus. In the short term, the crisis is unlikely to trigger any political change,&quot; Victoria Nemerenco, a program coordinator at Moldova&apos;s Institute for European Policies and Reforms, told the Kyiv Independent. Manole also said that Moldova is not ready &quot;to reintegrate Transnistria, because in the last 2-3 years Russia has taken care to reactivate another source of instability in the south of the Republic of Moldova (Gagauzia), while there are numerous groups in the country that openly support the Russian Federation and its efforts to occupy Ukraine and implicitly later the Republic of Moldova.&quot; The pro-Western government may be reluctant to reintegrate Transnistria because it would dramatically increase the share of pro-Russian voters in elections. &quot;In theory, these are suitable circumstances for kicking off the reintegration process,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;The problem is that the authorities in Chisinau do not seem to have a plan in this regard &#x2014; they seem preoccupied only with managing the crisis, not turning it into an opportunity. In short, this crisis is shaking the Tiraspol regime, but it will not necessarily topple it without more initiative and assertiveness from the Moldovan government.&quot; Dirun also said that &quot;there are discussions among colleagues in Chisinau that this could lead to the collapse of (Transnistria), but this will not happen.&quot; One reason why Moldova&apos;s reintegration is unlikely is that it may lead to a Russian economic or even military attack. However, Russia will also face difficulties if it decides to launch an actual military operation. Jamie Shea, a defense and security analyst at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Russia is today fully engaged in eastern Ukraine and in trying to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk Oblast.&quot; &quot;So it would probably have to halt its operations at least for a period in order to invade and subsequently occupy Moldova, although this country is much smaller and with far less defensive capacity than Ukraine,&quot; he added. He also said that Russian troops currently deployed in Transnistria &quot;are not trained and equipped for offensive operations and would not be able to move against the rest of Moldova without significant reinforcements.&quot; Moldovan army recruits take a break at their camp in Bulboaca, Moldova, May 16, 2024.

A major obstacle to EU accession, however, will be resolving the conflict with its breakaway Transnistria region, which has had a Russian military presence since 1992. (Will Baxter/Getty Images)Russia has a mere 1,700 troops in Transnistria, while Transnistria&apos;s army comprises about 7,500 troops. It would also be difficult for Russia to move troops to Moldova because it does not control any Ukrainian areas adjacent to the country, such as Odesa Oblast. &quot;Russia would also need to transport troops by air, and the transport planes could easily be shot down by Ukraine&apos;s air defense or over the Black Sea,&quot; Shea said. &quot;It would be a dangerous undertaking to move Russian ground forces and aircraft across Ukrainian territory in a wartime situation.&quot; He added that, instead of a direct invasion, Russia might &quot;use pro-Russian groups inside Moldova and Transnistria to destabilize the country and organize violence and disturbances.&quot; Muravschi also said that &quot;as long as Russia does not advance on the southern front in Ukraine and obtain a land bridge towards Transnistria, it would be very difficult for them to mount a military operation against Moldova.&quot; Analysts argue that, rather than using military force, Russia is more likely to use the gas and electricity crisis in Moldova to destabilize the political situation in the republic and help pro-Kremlin groups win the upcoming parliamentary election, which must be held in the second half of 2025. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. have pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow had spent millions of dollars to fund Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian candidate who lost to pro-Western President Maia Sandu in the Nov. 3 presidential election. Simultaneously with the election, Moldova held a referendum on adding the country&apos;s aspiration to join the EU to its constitution, with 50.35% of the voters supporting the move and 49.65% voting against it. A majority of voters living in Moldova voted against Sandu and amending the constitution, and the narrow victories were achieved due to the support of Moldovans living abroad, who account for nearly 15% of all registered voters. &quot;Why would Moscow need (a military operation) now, if it can achieve an electoral victory and have Moldova fall into the Kremlin&apos;s hands?&quot; Gerasimchuk said.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)He also said that Russia may &quot;choose a candidate capable of negotiating with Gazprom to restore gas supplies.&quot; &quot;Naturally, with promises of this kind, reinforced by unambiguous signals from Moscow, any politician or political force could gain the support of the socially vulnerable population and thus improve their results in the parliamentary elections,&quot; Gerasimchuk added. &quot;In such conditions, Moldova risks descending into governance chaos, where a weakened president will rely on an unstable parliament, which could lead to a prolonged socio-economic crisis,&quot; he added. &quot;In this situation, European integration will be off the table.&quot; Muravschi said that &quot;pro-Russian parties are claiming that this crisis is the result of the government&apos;s &apos;Russophobia&apos; and &quot;promise a secure supply of cheap energy from Russia if they come to power.&quot; He added that &quot;the popularity of the ruling pro-European party has been eroding for years now and the energy crisis is not helping them.&quot; &quot;At the moment, it seems impossible for Maia Sandu&apos;s party to retain a parliamentary majority by themselves at the next election,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;Russia&apos;s goal is clearly to destabilize the situation in Moldova, undermine the government, and help pro-Russian parties win the parliamentary election.&quot; Nemerenco also said that &quot;energy dependence has historically been one of Russia&apos;s key tools for exerting pressure, and the current crisis offers Moscow an opportunity to exploit Moldova&apos;s vulnerabilities.&quot; &quot;Rising energy prices and supply insecurity could directly affect household incomes and living standards, increasing public frustration; and the president, as well as the pro-European government, could thus become vulnerable to blame, even if the crisis stems from external factors,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-transnistrias-gas-crisis-lead-to-its-collapse-and-reintegration-into-moldova/	2025-01-14T04:02:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2043797379.jpg
65 oil tankers drop anchor after latest US sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports	Sixty-five oil tankers paused operations in various places around the world following the recent U.S.-U.K. sanctions against Russia&#x2019;s oil industry and shadow fleet, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing maritime tracking data. According to the news agency, five of those tankers were anchoring off China and Singapore, while others were idling in the Baltic Sea and near Russia&apos;s Far East. The latest sanctions targeted more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/65-oil-tankers-drop-anchor-after-latest-us-sanctions-against-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-01-14T03:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
European allies grow optimistic about Trump not abandoning Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-allies-grow-optimistic-about-trump-not-abandoning-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T02:40:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-10-19_27_27.jpg
Ukraine targets Russia's Engels airbase in 'multi-day, comprehensive operation,' drone forces report	Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s Engels airbase in a &quot;multi-day, comprehensive operation,&quot; Kyiv&apos;s 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment reported on Jan. 14. In a post on Facebook, the regiment &#x2014; part of Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces &#x2014; said the attacks were to &quot;reduce the enemy&apos;s strategic aviation capabilities,&quot; and had struck aviation fuel tanks used to supply Russian long-range bomber aircraft. &quot;We are doing our best to ensure that Engels fire crews, who have just put out the flames after the previous attack, are not left without work in the face of the increasingly difficult economic situation in Russia,&quot; it said. Earlier on Jan. 14, Russian local authorities reported an overnight drone attack had damaged an industrial facility in the city of Engels, located in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast, following a previous attack overnight on Jan. 8 which targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to Engels. They released no further details of what was hit on Jan. 14, but the 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment later claimed it had &quot;struck the infrastructure of (Engels airbase).&quot; It did not specify what type of weapon was used in the attack. A source in Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) later on Jan. 14 told the Kyiv Independent the attack had struck ammunition warehouses at the airbase storing cruise missiles and glide bombs. The SBU source added it was part of a wider operation overnight that targeted several sites across Russia, including the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant in Tula Oblast, the Saratov oil refinery, and the Bryansk chemical plant. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Several explosions were heard in the area, according to local reports from Russian Telegram channels. Located in the Saratov Oblast, over 750 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, Engels airbase &#x2013; also known as Engels-2 &#x2013; is home to the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment and 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. It was built in 1952 and has been in service since 1954. Engels is home to three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2013; the Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, and the Tupolev Tu-160, all regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities. The Tu-95 is the older of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles. Satellite imagery from Dec 3 &amp; 4, 2022, of Engels airbase, Russia (before reports of explosions at the base), showing recent military activity at &amp; near the airfield which houses a heavy bomber aviation unit, primarily comprised of Tu-95 (Bear) &amp; Tu-60 (Blackjack) bombers. (Maxar Technologies/Twitter)Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles &#x2013; either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles. It features turboprop propellers rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling. The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which poses a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. Currently, the missile can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system. The Tu-160 is Russia&apos;s more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world. It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s. Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces were established to improve Ukraine&apos;s work with drones, form special drone-specific units, and improve the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s material and numerical advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In turn, Russia has also widely deployed drone capabilities during the full-scale invasion, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russias-engels-airbase-in-multi-day-comprehensive-operation-drone-forces-report/	2025-01-14T02:39:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/FjOqRPzUYAwG8-F.jpeg
NATO chief says alliance either raises defense spending or can begin taking 'Russian language courses'	NATO should raise its current 2% of GDP defense spending goal, or the allies can begin taking &quot;Russian language courses or move to New Zealand,&quot; Secretary General Mark Rutte jokingly told the European Parliament on Jan. 13. Voices calling for higher defense spending across NATO grew louder after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Everything I&apos;m seeing at this moment is not nearly enough, and if we don&apos;t do it (raise the spending targets) we are safe now but not in four or five years. So if you don&apos;t do it, get out your Russian language courses or go to New Zealand,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;Or decide now to spend more, and that&apos;s exactly the debate we have to finalize over the next three or four months, to stay safe in this part of the world.&quot; The secretary general did not specify a new target number during his address. On Dec. 12, the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. According to the outlet&apos;s sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by the start of the next decade. Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump called for an even more radical increase, up to 5% of GDP. Trump has criticized NATO member states that do not meet the current 2% of GDP spending target. Several NATO allies, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, do not meet the current target, though the number of allies that do rose to 24 in 2024. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). In the face of Russia&apos;s war, Ukraine has drastically increased defense spending. Kyiv will spend 26% of its GDP on defense spending in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-says-alliance-either-raises-defense-spending-or-can-begin-taking-russian-language-courses/	2025-01-14T02:07:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188184447.jpg
Fico will not visit Kyiv, Slovak lawmaker says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will not visit Kyiv to discuss the halting of Russian gas transit through Ukraine, Tibor Gaspar, deputy-speaker of the Slovak Parliament told Russian state-controlled news agency TASS on Jan. 14 during a visit in Moscow. A day earlier, Fico had proposed in an open letter a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Slovakia to discuss the gas transit issue. In a response posted on social media, Zelensky agreed to the meeting but insisted Fico &quot;come to Kyiv on Friday.&quot; &#x201C;Yesterday, Prime Minister Fico published an open letter for Zelensky and invited him for talks. Zelensky replied that it was necessary to come to Kyiv on Friday. It&apos;s not possible. I think it will not happen,&#x201D; Gaspar said. The development is the latest in an escalating conflict between Ukraine and Slovakia over Kyiv&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas. Fico estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, and also threatened to limit aid to Ukrainian refugees in Slovakia. Zelensky previously said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-will-not-visit-kyiv-slovakian-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-14T01:48:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192475502.jpg

Trump wants to meet Putin 'very quickly' after inauguration	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 13 that he plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. The incoming U.S. president echoed his previous comments on his intent to meet the Russian leader and hammer out a deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which nears its third anniversary. Trump initially declared during his presidential campaign he would end the war within 24 hours, though he recently extended this timeline to up to six months.

Oil tanker crew planned more cable sabotage before capture, Finland says	Finnish investigators say the crew of an oil tanker accused of damaging undersea power and communication cables in the Baltic Sea were preparing to cut additional infrastructure before authorities intervened, according to Reuters. Last month, Finnish authorities boarded an oil tanker Eagle S, allegedly part of Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic Sea region has faced numerous disruptions to power cables, telecom links, and gas pipelines. NATO member states surrounding the Baltic Sea are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Jan. 14 to discuss collective measures against such threats. The Eagle S allegedly caused damage to the Estlink 2 power line and four telecommunications cables between Finland and Estonia by dragging its anchor over 100 kilometers along the seabed. Risto Lohi, head of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, said the ship was also at risk of damaging the Estlink 1 power line and the BalticConnector gas pipeline when authorities took action. &quot;There would have been an almost immediate danger that other cables or pipes related to our critical underwater infrastructure could have been damaged,&quot; Lohi said. Authorities are investigating nine of the ship&#x2019;s crew members, including the Georgian captain and sailors from India and Georgia. In a separate incident, Baltic Sea nations suspect the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 of dragging its anchor to sever two undersea fiber-optic cables in November. Sweden&apos;s Civil Defense Minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, stated that evidence of anchor damage linked to the Yi Peng 3 was also found near the NordBalt power cable, which connects Sweden and Lithuania. &quot;This obviously illustrates the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in,&quot; Bohlin reprotedly said.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-tanker-crew-planned-more-cable-sabotage-before-capture-finland-says/	2025-01-13T19:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg

Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, Biden says	Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said at a foreign policy address on Jan. 13. Biden&apos;s remarks come as his term as president comes to an end and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears its third year. Biden reflected on his foreign policy record, including his role in Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia, one week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. The president defending his administration&apos;s policies and said they prevented Putin from reaching his goals. &quot;When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he&apos;d conquer Kyiv in a matter of days,&quot; Biden said. &quot;The truth is, since that war began I&apos;m the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him, Putin never has.&quot; Biden visited Kyiv in February 2023, becoming the only U.S. commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. &quot;Putin has failed to achieve any of his strategic objectives,&quot; Biden said. &quot;He has failed thus far to subjugate Ukraine, failed to break the unity of NATO, and failed to make large territorial gains. There is more to do, we can&apos;t walk away.&quot; Biden praised Washington&apos;s coalition-building and readiness to provide military aid, saying the U.S. brought together 50 nations to stand with Ukraine and delivered &quot;massive numbers of munitions&quot; and other crucial assistance to Kyiv. The address also touched on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions in weakening Russia&apos;s economy. The U.S. has &quot;enacted relentless unprecedented sanctions to keep Ukraine in the fight ... Russia is struggling to replace what they are losing on the battlefield in terms of military equipment and fighters and the ruble is under enormous pressure,&quot; Biden said. Biden echoed earlier remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said on Jan. 12 that the White House was preparing a strong Ukraine policy foundation to hand off to the incoming Trump administration. &quot;(W)e laid the foundation for the next administration so they can protect the bright future of the Ukrainian people,&quot; Biden said. Trump has previously criticized U.S. military support for Ukraine and promised to negotiate an end to the war. He is reportedly in the process of planning an in-person meeting with Putin, set to take place at an unspecified time after his inauguration. Biden has urged the U.S. congress to continue sending aid to Ukraine even if Trump is opposed to further assistance. In a speech on Jan. 10, Biden said he did everything he could to help Ukraine during his time in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-and-allies-cant-walk-away-from-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-13T14:32:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Biden.png
Zelensky announces new sanctions on Russian financial sector	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 13 imposing new sanctions on the Russian financial sector. Since the launch of full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been expanding its list of sanctions against individuals and enterprises that support Russia&apos;s war. The sanctions target 140 distinct entitites, Zelensky said in his evening address. Along with the decree, the president also signed a draft law introducing criminal penalties for attempts to evade sanctions. The proposed law is based on international standards for enforcing sanctions. &quot;We all understand that the more pressure we exert on the aggressor, the closer we bring peace,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Sanctions are one of the most effective tools for justly pressuring Russia and everyone associated with it or working for the war.&quot; The draft law will be next be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament. Days before Zelensky&apos;s announcement, the United States and United Kingdom imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials.

Kovalenko also said on Jan. 13 that explosions had occurred at the &quot;Kremniy El&quot; microelectronics plant &#xA0;in Bryansk, though Russian sources have not reported an attack on that site and the Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim. &quot;Kremniy El&quot; was previously targeted in attacks in October 2024 and August 2023. &#xA0; The plant produces components widely used in Russian defense production, including for Pantsir air defense systems and Iskander missile systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/bryansk-chemical-plant-hit-in-aerial-attack-russian-media-says/	2025-01-13T12:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247635468.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv doesn't confirm	Key developments on Jan. 13: Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. The Russian statement could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian forces find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian troops. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian troops and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment. Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience. Germany delivered the first batch of the promised 54 RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers, the country&apos;s Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said during a news conference on Jan. 13. Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155. The U.K. will finance the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13 following a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey in London. &quot;The U.K. has already invested in the production of our weapons, and this collaboration continues &#x2014; specifically, funding will be directed toward the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. Umerov met with Healey to discuss bilateral cooperation in 2025 in key security areas. &quot;The U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to providing continuous and comprehensive support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position both on the battlefield and on the international stage,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We anticipate enhanced military, political, and economic assistance from our British allies this year.&quot; Umerov did not provide further details on how London would finance Ukrainian defense industry. In 2025, Ukraine plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, according to Umerov. The rest may be supported by allies, he added. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year, as well as the development of new missiles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine, in recent months, has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025 and conducted the first successful test of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-east-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-01-13T12:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142681.jpg
Ukraine’s new Kursk push brings minor gains, raising concerns over limited resources	Since the new push in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in early January, Ukraine has made small gains and managed to capture the first North Korean prisoners of war in the area but experts have raised concerns about Kyiv&#x2019;s use of limited resources while fierce battles rage elsewhere. The assessment comes as more &#x2013; but still limited &#x2013; open-source data emerges from the week-old Ukrainian operation around the village of Berdin in what experts believe was Kyiv&#x2019;s tactic to take advantage of a weakened Russian defense in the area. The Ukrainian military has so far remained silent on the operation, though reporting on Jan. 5 that the most intense fighting across the front line was happening in Kursk Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation (CCD) in the National Security and Defense Council, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces had advanced over two kilometers in Kursk Oblast on the first day. He declined to comment further on operational details. In a Jan. 5 Telegram post, Kovalenko said that the Ukrainian attacks in several directions in Kursk Oblast &quot;came as a surprise&quot; for the Russian troops. Andrii Yermak, the head of the President&#x2019;s Office, praised the &#x201C;good news&#x201D; from the southwestern Russian region where Ukraine is gripping onto a narrow patch of territory at high costs, saying that &#x201C;Russia is getting what it deserves.&#x201D; Western and Ukrainian military experts warned that the scale and success of the costly Ukrainian operation were &#x201C;exaggerated,&#x201D; with Kyiv achieving minor tactical gains &#x2013; at least some of which Russia appears to have reclaimed quickly. The new Ukrainian attacks came five months after Kyiv launched its cross-border incursion into Russia in August 2024, surprising Western leaders and temporarily boosting the morale among the exhausted troops elsewhere withdrawing little by little. Some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most elite units, along with the less experienced ones, took part in the operation. However, months into the incursion, more Ukrainian soldiers have increasingly grown pessimistic toward what they believe would be a short-lived operation, with many questioning the cost of invading another country&#x2019;s territory when the defense of one&#x2019;s own is at stake. Since August, Ukraine has reportedly lost more than half of the Kursk Oblast territories it captured. Meanwhile, Russia has advanced at its quickest pace since early 2022, and the stretched-out Ukrainian troops have lost important long-time strongholds, including Vuhledar, Selydove, and, most recently, Kurakhove in the eastern Donetsk Oblast.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kursk incursion rages on as unpredictable U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has recently said he hopes to end the war in Ukraine in about half a year, is due to take office on Jan. 20. It is widely believed that Ukraine&#x2019;s control of Russian territory could be a bargaining chip at the possible future negotiations with Russia. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Seoul on Jan. 6 that Ukraine&#x2019;s small patch of Kursk Oblast &#x201C;is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year.&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s recent attacks against Russian positions in Kursk Oblast are &#x201C;very limited&#x201D; due to severe manpower and resource shortages, Ivan Stupak, a Ukrainian military commentator and former Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officer, said. Estimating the push to involve from hundreds to 2,000 Ukrainian troops at most and dozens of heavy equipment, Stupak said that the renewed operation appears to be 70% for political purposes and 30% for military purposes. The operation appears to be Kyiv&#x2019;s attempt to inflict &#x201C;pain&#x201D; one more time on Russia and provide Ukrainians with &#x201C;a bit more victories&#x201D; in the tough time when the front-line situation continues to deteriorate, according to the expert. He added that it may also be to relieve the situation across hot spots of the war in Ukraine, such as in the Donbas, by trying to force Russia to deploy more troops to the Kursk axis, as well as to possibly disrupt Moscow&#x2019;s tactical plans in the area. &#x201C;I expect that it will be maybe a couple of weeks of offensive operation but within Kursk Oblast,&#x201D; Stupak told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine currently controls about 450 kilometers of Kursk Oblast territory, which is roughly the size of Detroit, according to Stupak. Ukraine managed to break through the Russian defenses in some villages in the Berdin area, but it appears Ukrainians have already been pushed out of some, Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Black Bird Group analyzing the war closely through open source, said. Advancing anywhere in Kursk Oblast is now difficult due to the high concentration of Russia&#x2019;s troops and its heavy use of first-person view (FPV) drones and glide bombs, according to experts. &#x201C;It is pretty clear that the Ukrainians don&apos;t have any more capabilities to rapidly advance in this area anymore,&#x201D; Kastehelmi told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;So it&apos;s more of these localized counterattacks and then just staying on the defense instead of a new offensive phase.&#x201D; Ukraine may have tried to seize the moment when there was a low number or quality of Russian soldiers deployed at this particular point, a shortage of heavy equipment in the area, or the rotation of units, according to experts. &#x201C;Currently, it seems that the Russians were able to counter some of the Ukrainian advances and then strike back,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. The operation appears to have gained tactical gains but &quot;nothing that would change the general dynamics of the battlefield,&#x201D; he added. Spending forces to take &quot;some small, very local successes in the furthest corner of the (Kursk) salient&quot; when Ukraine is struggling to hold onto its remaining captured territories amid the serious manpower issue could be &quot;net negative,&quot; Kastehelmi suggested. Russian troops have been pushing from the flanks, particularly toward the town of Sudzha and from the western direction of the salient, so trying to advance further toward the corners without expanding the flanks may compromise Ukrainian defense, according to Kastehelmi. Yaroslav, a serviceman in the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces sabotage and reconnaissance group deployed in Kursk Oblast, agreed with Kastehelmi&#x2019;s assessment. The soldier is only identified by first name in accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military. Yaroslav stressed that the situation around the strategic town of Sudzha is difficult, with Russian troops continuing to push in the areas of villages to its north and south &#x2013; Malaya Loknya and Makhovka. &#x201C;Instead of expanding our flanks, we are drilling into the enemy&apos;s depths,&#x201D; Yaroslav told the Kyiv Independent.

(Serhiy Morgunov/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Holding onto Sudzha is crucial for Kyiv. With the only one main road used to support Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast from the adjacent Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, losing the town could jeopardize Ukrainian logistics crucial for the operation, according to Ukrainian expert Stupak. &#x201C;If Russians will manage to cut this road, it will be very difficult to supply Ukrainians with everything &#x2013; with medicine, manpower, heavy equipment, shells, etc.,&#x201D; he said. The overall Russian offensive &#x2013; supported by North Korean soldiers &#x2013; continues in Kursk Oblast despite the local Ukrainian attacks on the corner of the salient, making it extremely difficult for the Ukrainians to hold the ground. About 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December. Stupak also argued that gaining territory is just one side of the medal, the other one is holding it. &#x201C;It&apos;s a big question because we are using the best of the best soldiers in this land and of the best supplied Western equipment and lots of other directions, such as Donetsk or Zaporizhzhia oblasts, they are suffering from a shortage of shells, manpower, equipped and motivated detachments.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-kursk-push-brings-minor-gains-concerns-rise-over-use-of-limited-resources/	2025-01-13T12:20:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166951505.jpg
Everything we know about the North Korean POWs captured by Ukraine	Ukrainian forces fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast captured two North Korean soldiers, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 11, &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; Zelensky said, claiming that North Korean military personnel usually &quot;finish off their wounded&quot; in order to hide the evidence of their participation in the war. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Ukrainian forces captured a wounded North Korean soldier during operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Yonhap reported on Dec. 27, citing the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), though he later reportedly died of his wounds. Since Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Jan. 11, a few details about the POWs have emerged, as well as questions about what could happen to them next. &quot;I know it&apos;s seen as a bit of a propaganda coup, but in the big scheme of things, I think it&apos;s of minimal significance,&quot; retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv independent. Despite the capture of two North Korean POWs fighting for Russia being the first of its kind, Ryan said in terms of the war in Ukraine, and the numbers of prisoners taken by both sides, they&apos;re &quot;just two more soldiers.&quot; &quot;And we shouldn&apos;t read too much into it or give too much strategic emphasis on the capture of a couple of soldiers,&quot; he adds. Ryan also doubts that they&apos;ll be able to give Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies much more of an insight into the inner workings of the North Korean military than they already know. &quot;Remember, North Korean soldiers have defected to South Korea before. So, you know, there&apos;s already a flow every now and then of North Koreans that are exploited for intelligence value,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed a willingness to return the POWs to North Korea, if the country&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian POWs in Russia. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways,&quot; he added in a post on his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. But simply swapping North Korean and Ukrainian POWs may not be that simple. According to South Korean officials, North Korean troops fighting for Russia have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner. &quot;Memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture,&quot; lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Jan. 13, citing Seoul&apos;s National Intelligence Service. The claim appeared to be confirmed by a video released on the same day by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces, showing Ukrainian soldiers storming positions manned by North Korean soldiers. The video shows one of the soldiers &#x2014; who a Ukrainian in the video identifies as &quot;Korean&quot; &#x2014; detonate a grenade near his face when Ukrainian troops approach.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)A Russian ID document allegedly carried by a captured North Korean POW under the name of a Tuva Republic resident, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025.(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Andrew Clapham, professor of international law at the Geneva Graduate Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that this raises &quot;complications&quot; about Ukraine&apos;s stated proposal to return them home in a prisoner swap. &quot;The complication arises if there&apos;s a substantial risk that they would be subjected to human rights violations,&quot; Clapham said, adding: &quot;There&apos;s a chance one would think that they would be punished for failing to carry out those orders (to kill themselves).&quot; Returning the POWs knowing this would be a violation of the Geneva Conventions, Clapham adds. Usually, assurances that the POWs would not be subject to human rights violations would carry some weight, but North Korea&apos;s abysmal human rights record and pariah status complicate matters further. &quot;I think most people wouldn&apos;t accept on face value what are called diplomatic assurances in this context,&quot; Clapham adds. The two North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. In videos published by the SBU, one can be seen with his head and chin bandaged, while the other has bandaged hands. The SBU said on Jan. 11 the captured soldiers are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021. &quot;It is noteworthy that the prisoner, like the Russian military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, emphasizes that he was supposedly going for training and not for a war against Ukraine,&quot; the SBU said. According to the SBU, the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer.

Zelensky posted video footage of the SBU&apos;s interrogation of the two POWs, mediated by Korean translators. In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. As of now, it&apos;s unclear where they will end up. &quot;They could remain in Ukrainian hands, or, the suggestion is that they would go to South Korea,&quot; Clapham said. And with fighting ongoing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, it&apos;s unlikely that they will remain the only North Korean soldiers in such a situation. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/everything-we-know-about-the-north-korean-pows-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-13T11:24:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34--2-.jpg

Volyn exhumations in Ukraine's Ternopil Oblast to begin in April, media reports	Exhumation of the remains of Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy buried in Ternopil Oblast, where the village of Puzhnyky was located in the 1940s, will begin in April, Polish RMF FM reported on Jan. 13. Ukraine and Poland agreed in early 2025 to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. The Volyn tragedy, also known as the Volyn massacres, took place in 1943 during World War II on the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliation. The Volyn massacres are a contentious topic between Ukraine and Poland and have often led to soured diplomatic relations. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. The Freedom and Democracy Foundation, which uncovered the grave site two years ago, received permission from the Ukrainian authorities to exhume the remains and conduct further research. The exhumation&apos;s primary purpose is to identify the people whose remains were found in the pit near the former cemetery. Experts are already collecting genetic material from descendants, the media outlet reported. Following the excavation, the remains will be examined by Polish archaeologists and anthropologists, Deputy Chairman of the Freedom and Democracy Foundation Maciej Dancewicz said. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Donald Tusk previously met in Lviv on Dec. 17 to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/volyn-tragedy-exhumations-in-ukraines-ternopil-oblast-to-begin-in-april-media-reports/	2025-01-13T10:30:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
Fico invited Zelensky to Slovakia to discuss gas transit via Ukraine; Zelensky responds	Editor&apos;s note: The story was updated as President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Fico&apos;s invitation. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico proposed President Volodymyr Zelensky a meeting in Slovakia to discuss halting the Russian gas transit through Ukraine in his video address on Jan. 13 on Facebook. &quot;Okay. Come to Kyiv on Friday,&quot; Zelensky responded a few hours later to Fico&apos;s call on X. A day prior, Zelensky reacted to Fico&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Zelensky said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot; Fico said he would not respond to Zelensky&apos;s recent statement to avoid &quot;further escalation of tensions.&quot; Fico claimed he wanted to focus instead on &quot;resolving the situation with the shutdown of gas transit.&quot; The Slovakian prime minister said he would like to hold a meeting with Zelensky in Slovakia near the border with Ukraine &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Fico believed that this move would establish &quot;favorable conditions&quot; for discussing gas supplies to Slovakia and other countries through Ukraine and possible &quot;technical solutions,&quot; considering the termination of the contract between Ukraine and Russia on Dec. 31, 2024. Fico also estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-offers-zelensky-to-meet-discuss-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-13T09:05:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Vital Pokrovsk coking coal mine halts operation, Reuters reports	As Russian troops continue approaching the city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine halts the extraction of coking coal near the city, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing unnamed sources. &quot;They have all stopped working now,&quot; one Reuters source said. &quot;There&apos;s no production there, they&apos;re only working on the surface,&quot; another Reuters source added. The Pokrovsk coal mine, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is located 10 km (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. The mine produces coal for coke production needed in steelmaking, which is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The coal mine, owned by steelmaker Metinvest BV, was the only one in Ukraine producing coking coal. The eastern front near the town has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast, given Pokrovsk&apos;s importance as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. According to trade data, exports of steel products totaled nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. Experts say Ukrainian steelmakers could have produced up to 7.5 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2024 and planned to increase production to more than 10 million tons in 2025. Losing Pokrovsk, however, would set back production to 2-3 million tons a year.	https://kyivindependent.com/vital-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-halts-operation-reuters-reports/	2025-01-13T08:37:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg

Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-announces-first-deliveries-of-promised-rch-155-self-propelled-howitzers/	2025-01-13T07:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193126935-1.jpg
Russia's energy giant Gazprom plans major layoffs as Europe market shrinks, media reports	The Russian energy giant Gazprom is preparing to lay off 1,600 employees from its central office as it faces significant financial losses and dwindling market presence in Europe, Russia&apos;s local 47News media outlet reported on Jan. 13. The news comes after Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas to other European countries, ending an arrangement dating back to Soviet times. Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee Elena Ilyukhina reportedly sent a letter to Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller, outlining the need for cost optimization due to &quot;challenges facing the Gazprom Group.&quot; The letter suggests that 50 billion rubles ($480 million) are spent annually on salaries. To address this issue, it proposes reducing the central office workforce from 4,100 to 2,500 employees. Sergey Kupriyanov, deputy chairman of Gazprom&apos;s Board of Directors, confirmed the letter&apos;s authenticity to Forbes Russia but declined to provide further comments. Gazprom has suffered massive losses following the collapse of its European gas market, with exports to Europe dropping by more than 80% since 2021. Shares of the company fell to their lowest level since January 2009, trading at 106.1 rubles ($1.01) on Dec. 17, representing a 33.5% decline since the start of 2024. Heavy taxation further burdened Gazprom, which contributed $28 billion to the Russian government in 2023, accounting for 9% of state revenue. The EU&apos;s decision to pivot to alternative gas sources after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered the decline, significantly reducing Europe&apos;s reliance on Russian supplies, with the exception of countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria. Russia&apos;s direct pipeline gas supplies to the EU have now halted completely as Ukraine chose not to prolong the transit deal with Gazprom past Dec. 31, 2024. At the same time, the EU countries purchased record volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-energy-giant-gazprom-plans-major-layoffs-media-repots/	2025-01-13T06:13:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Russia's federal budget won't fund anti-drone systems at civilian airports, media reports	Russia will not allocate federal funds to equip civilian airports with anti-drone systems as initially expected, pro-Kremlin publication Vedomosti reported on Jan. 12, citing two undisclosed sources. This decision affects airports classified as Category I transportation infrastructure facilities, raising concerns about the vulnerability of Russia&apos;s civil aviation to drone-related threats. The Russian government was originally expected to spend over 11 billion rubles ($106 million) by 2028 to equip 31 airports, including those in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Sochi, and other major cities, with drone defense systems. However, this funding was not indicated in the relevant federal strategy document on infrastructure security, Vedomosti writes. This means it will be up to the airports&apos; management to ensure security against potential drone threats, the outlet wrote. Russia&apos;s decision not to fund anti-drone systems at key airports highlights gaps in its ability to address potential threats to civil aviation. Effective airport defense systems involve long-range drone detection systems, airspace closure, and neutralization using standard air defense measures. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has launched long-range drone strikes targeting Russian energy, military, and industrial facilities. Russian airports often halt operations for security reasons amid drone attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-cancels-funding-for-anti-drone-systems-at-civilian-airports-media-reports/	2025-01-13T05:46:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
EU announces additional $143 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine	The European Union is allocating an additional 140 million euros ($143 million) in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, the European Commission said in a statement on Jan. 13. In addition to this sum, the EU will allocate 8 million euros ($8.16 million) to Moldova to support Ukrainian refugees and their host communities. This will bring the overall humanitarian aid provided by the EU to the two countries since 2022 to over 1.1 billion euros ($1.12 billion). &quot;The funding will be directed towards emergency assistance, including food, shelter, clean water, healthcare, and winter protection&#x2026; supporting vulnerable populations in the heavily war impacted regions of eastern and southern Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. The announcement coincides with European Commissioner for Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib&#x2019;s visit to Ukraine. &quot;As Russia continues its cruelty in the dead of winter, the EU is intensifying its support to keep the lights on and homes warm,&quot; the commissioner said in the statement. Russia&apos;s war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, driving millions from their homes while dealing heavy damage to residential and energy infrastructure. Amid Russia&apos;s invasion, the EU has stepped up support for Ukraine in response to Ukraine&apos;s EU aspirations. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, which officially began in June 2024. Previously, Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said 2030 is a very real date for Ukraine to join the European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-143-million-in-humanitarian-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-01-13T05:15:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239977099.jpg
Ukraine opens doors to foreign firms for military equipment modernization	Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-opens-doors-to-foreign-firms-for-military-equipment-modernization/	2025-01-13T04:51:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russia, Iran to sign strategic partnership agreement on Jan. 17	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, will sign a strategic partnership agreement during the latter&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17, the Kremlin&apos;s press service said. The two leaders are also expected to discuss expanding Russian-Iranian bilateral cooperation in &quot;trade, investment, transport, logistics, humanitarian sphere, and current issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the statement read. In December 2024, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced plans to pen the deal by the end of January. The agreement is expected to cement the growing military and political partnership between Russia and Iran. Moscow has been Tehran&apos;s traditional partner, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. Putin signed a similar agreement with North Korea last June, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-iran-to-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-jan-17/	2025-01-13T04:20:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177151439.jpg
EU's Nordic, Baltic members reportedly urge lowering of Russian oil price cap	Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have urged the European Commission to further decrease the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil set by the G7, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing their joint letter seen by the news agency. The countries argue that a lower cap would further restrict Russia&apos;s ability to finance its war against Ukraine while avoiding significant disruptions to global oil markets. Under current terms, Western companies can insure and transport Russian oil only if sold below the cap. In their letter to the European Commission, the six nations reportedly emphasized the need to &quot;further increase the impact of our sanctions by lowering the G7 oil price cap.&quot; The G7 initially implemented the cap to reduce Moscow&apos;s oil revenues while maintaining stability in global markets. With forecasts of a global oil surplus in 2025 and softening prices, the G7 may consider more stringent measures. Sanctions and Ukrainian drone strikes have already disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production, with refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk reducing or halting operations. These pressures have forced Russia&apos;s energy sector to sell oil at a discount and operate under high interest rates, further straining its capacity. The call to lower the price cap reflects ongoing efforts by European nations to maximize economic pressure on Russia while supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-russian-oil-price-cap/	2025-01-13T04:02:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
For the first time, Russia labels independent media outlet as 'terrorist group'	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has designated the independent media outlet Komi Daily as a &quot;terrorist organization,&quot; several news outlets reported on Jan. 13, citing recent changes on the FSB&apos;s website. This marks the first time the FSB has applied such a label to a media outlet. Komi Daily, known for its coverage of culture and daily life in Russia&apos;s northwestern Komi Republic, has been critical of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. The outlet has faced escalating state pressure, including website blockages and fines against its editor for alleged incitement. The FSB claims Komi Daily is linked to the Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, a movement advocating for the decentralization and decolonization of Russia by dismantling it into 41 autonomous states. The outlet denies any affiliation with the forum. The Supreme Court finalized the designation in late December, intensifying Russia&apos;s suppression of dissenting voices, particularly the independent media critical of the Kremlin. The Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Oleg Magaletsky and led by exiled Bashkir activist Ruslan Gabbasov, had already been labeled &quot;undesirable&quot; and &quot;terrorist&quot; by Russian authorities. Prosecutors allege the forum supports terrorism and sabotage while promoting the independence of regions like Komi. The FSB&apos;s move is part of an expanding crackdown on independent journalism in Russia. The Kremlin has increasingly targeted media advocating for regional independence or criticizing the government, forcing many journalists into exile.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-labels-komi-daily-as-terrorist-group-first-media-outlet-to-receive-such-designation/	2025-01-13T03:47:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian defenders find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the eastern town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military recently claimed it continues to hold positions at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant. Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on Jan. 10 shared footage showing Russian soldiers raising flags over damaged buildings, claiming to be located in Yantarne. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 12, 2025, according to DeepState. Yantarne marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian defenders. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-donetsk-kharkiv-oblasts/	2025-01-13T03:28:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190850427.jpg
The question isn't if China will turn on Russia, but when	Like Czar Nicholas II, Russian President Vladimir Putin has misidentified his primary foe. Fighting a war of choice, he allows the real menace to his country to gather strength. China, not Ukraine, constitutes Russia&#x2019;s existential threat. In the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), Nicholas fought Japan over Manchuria for concessions that Russia could not monetize, instead of investing in the railways and munitions needed to fight the country&#x2019;s actual enemy, Germany, a decade later. Defeat in World War I cost Nicholas and his family their lives after the Bolsheviks seized power. Nobles who did not suffer the same violent fate as the czar fled abroad, often dying in penury. The West and Ukraine never intended to invade Russia, let alone take its territory. Who in the West would want it? China, on the other hand, very well might. Its long list of grievances dates back centuries, to the czars who removed large swaths of territory &#x2014; an area larger than the United States east of the Mississippi River &#x2014; from China&#x2019;s sphere of influence. Putin&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine was a pivotal error &#x2014; the type that precludes a return to the pre-war status quo. Instead, such errors lead to alternatives that are far less desirable. The question is not whether Russia will lose its war against Ukraine (in strategic terms, it already has), but only how big the loss will be. The war has cost Russia more than 700,000 casualties. It has forced Russia to reorient its lucrative European energy trade to less profitable markets. It has depressed productivity through sanctions. It has led to the impoundment of its foreign-exchange reserves, with the accruing interest diverted to Ukraine. It has triggered the flight of hundreds of thousands of prime working-age citizens (often highly educated and in the crucial tech sector). It has precipitated the bombing of Russian factories, military bases, and infrastructure, as well as the first invasion of its territory (in the Kursk region) since World War II. And it has brought about the expansion and reinvigoration of NATO, with Sweden and Finland&#x2019;s accession to membership in the alliance transforming the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake. Even if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump somehow ends the war, Putin cannot reverse these losses. And the longer it continues, the weaker Russia will become, leading many to wonder when it will decide to staunch its losses. Russians ousted Nicholas II for mismanaging the war, wrecking the economy, and being profligate with the lives of his subjects. Like Nicholas&#x2019;s entourage, Putin&#x2019;s is helping him double down on his bad decision to invade Ukraine instead of bailing out while they still can. But the longer they stick with Putin, the greater their vulnerability to China will become.

(Kristina Kormilitsyna/PHOTOHOST AGENCY/Anadolu via Getty Images)The question is not whether China will turn on Russia, but when. China will eventually eat Russia&#x2019;s lunch; the only remaining uncertainty is how big the meal will be. Russia has expended much of its Cold War arsenal on Ukraine, leaving Siberia wide open to Chinese ambitions. Siberia has the resources that China covets: not only energy and minerals, but, more importantly, water. Lake Baikal is larger than Belgium and contains 20% of the world&#x2019;s fresh surface water, which North China desperately needs. Putin apparently intends to escalate his way to victory. The war started with his bungled invasion and attempt at regime change in Kyiv, followed by efforts to bludgeon Ukrainians into submission with massacres of civilians in cities like Bucha, gratuitous destruction of homes and towns, and cross-border abductions of thousands of children. Then came the targeting of civilian shelters, hospitals, schools, museums, and power stations; the summary executions and torture of POWs; the destruction of the massive Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River; threats to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (although Russia, not Ukraine, sits downwind from it); and the use of mines, Turkish drones, ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, glide bombs, and now North Korean troops. If Putin used nuclear weapons, which he has periodically threatened to do, Russians would become the pariahs of the 21st century, replacing the Nazis of the last century. Like the Germans before them, Russians also support wars of territorial conquest. After the Soviet Union&#x2019;s export of its economic model impoverished so much of the world (itself included), nuking a neighbor would cement Russia&#x2019;s status as the world&#x2019;s most regressive country, and its people as the world&#x2019;s most brutal. The negative strategic effects for Russia and Russians would last for generations &#x2014; just ask the Germans. The million-ruble question is whether Putin&#x2019;s entourage intends to stick with him for the entire ride, which would leave them at China&#x2019;s, not Putin&#x2019;s, mercy and headed toward an economic destination similar to that of North Korea. From China, they should expect retribution for Russia&#x2019;s chain of abuse going back to the mid-19th century. Russia&#x2019;s power brokers should ask whose interests the war now serves. At this stage, the answer is clear: Putin&#x2019;s alone. The rest of us can observe their unfolding national disaster as they decide between salvaging what they can and going down with the ship. To avoid the fate of the Russian nobility &#x2014; or falling from high-rise windows &#x2014; the Russian elite could incentivize Putin to retire and cut their country&#x2019;s losses by returning territory in exchange for keeping their personal wealth. Unfortunately, Russians seem to require national catastrophes to precipitate a reassessment of their strategy. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Slavoj Žižek: The magic tricks behind Russia’s propaganda machine	I must admit that I occasionally enjoy podcasts explaining the secrets behind well-known magic tricks (the three-shell game, mentalism, levitation, etc.). After reading recent news from Russia, I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that these tricks offer a clue to how Russian propaganda has achieved what seems impossible to common sense: claiming that the Russian attack on Ukraine is an act of self-defense. The standard explanation for magic tricks is that they usually rely on at least two different strategies, combining them to produce the desired effects &#x2014; and Russia is doing exactly the same. The Russian government approved a list of 48 foreign states and territories accused of implementing policies that promote destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes, which contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. This list was approved under a decree signed by Putin on Aug. 19, aimed at providing humanitarian support to those &quot;sharing traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.&quot; States on this list are now officially designated as &#x201C;enemy states&#x201D; simply because they don&#x2019;t share these values &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no mention of a multi-polar world; you are an enemy of Russia just for not sharing its values. Oddly, North Korea and Afghanistan are included on this list, but Russia isn&#x2019;t being deceptive: its respect for &#x201C;traditional values&#x201D; aligns with North Korean and Taliban ideology in rejecting the European Enlightenment as the ultimate evil in history. The conflict is thus elevated to a metaphysical-religious level: beneath all the talk of a new multi-polar world lies the vision of a total war to the extinction of two opposites. When religion directly enters politics, the threat of deadly violence is never far behind. Putin recently declared a new nuclear doctrine, announcing that &#x201C;a number of clarifications ... defining the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons&#x201D; were being made to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear doctrine. He added that proposed amendments would expand &#x201C;the category of states and military alliances in relation to which nuclear deterrence is carried out.&#x201D; In a pointed warning to the West, Putin announced that any attack on Russia by a non-nuclear state, supported by a nuclear-armed nation, would be considered a &#x201C;joint attack.&#x201D; He also stated that Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in case of an attack on Belarus, as it is part of the &#x201C;Union State&#x201D; with Russia, a special partnership between the two nations. This includes cases when the enemy, using conventional weapons, &#x201C;creates critical danger to our sovereignty,&#x201D; Putin said. Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) looks on as Russian military officers lay a wreath during a ceremony at the Unknown Soldier&apos;s Tomb in Moscow, Russia, on June 22, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Such statements make us nostalgic for the Cold War era, when both sides wisely avoided direct nuclear threats and announced they would use nuclear arms only in response to a nuclear strike. The threat of a direct nuclear strike was unmentionable back then. Russia has now asserted the right to a first strike and even expanded the conditions for its use. Of course, an actual Russian first strike remains unlikely, but words in the military domain are never just words &#x2014; they often lead to action. After thousands of pagers exploded in Lebanon, Iran&#x2019;s UN delegate said Israel had &#x201C;crossed a red line&#x201D; again. But today, crossing red lines happens regularly, making the situation even more dangerous because each side thinks it can do so without consequence. The catch is that you can&#x2019;t do this indefinitely: there is a real red line, though it may not be publicly acknowledged, and the only way to learn where it is is to cross it. Our response to Russia should be that Russia itself has crossed the red line by issuing nuclear threats. Those who see the Russia-Ukraine war as a proxy war between NATO and Russia would claim that Russia is under attack by NATO. In some sense, this is true, but in what sense? In the same sense that Israel claims to act in self-defense in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. The catch lies in how we define the &quot;self&quot; in self-defense. If I occupy land that isn&#x2019;t mine and declare it mine (like the West Bank or parts of Ukraine), and if the land or people there resist, I can claim that my actions to crush them are in self-defense. The two basic strategies Russian state propaganda relies on are these: accuse the opponent of doing what you are doing yourself, in a much more open and brutal way. This distracts the public&#x2019;s attention and makes them accept your basic claim that what you took from the opponent was originally yours. Russia is just defending itself &#x2014; if we accept that Crimea and Donetsk (and perhaps other regions, from the Baltic to Moldova) belong to it, and that Ukraine as a nation doesn&#x2019;t truly exist, but emerged from the minds of Lenin and the Nazis. The second strategy is to accuse the opponent of dangerously approaching a red line after you&#x2019;ve blatantly crossed the only true red line &#x2014; the use of nuclear weapons. This combination of strategies makes rational peace negotiations nearly impossible, because the very terms of negotiation are falsified from the outset. As Luka Lisjak Gabrijel&#x10D;i&#x10D; rightly wrote: &#x201C;Peace is all too precious to be left to peaceniks.&#x201D; Add to this the third strategy of deception: presenting a brutal war of conquest as a defense of spiritual values. This combination is nearly unbeatable. All our hope lies in the &#x201C;nearly.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-the-magic-tricks-behind-russias-propaganda-machine/	2025-01-13T02:36:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149287288.jpg
Ukraine's special forces claim to repel North Korean assault in Russia's Kursk Oblast, killing 17 soldiers	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead and dying North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian mopping-up group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian soldiers and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repels-north-korean-assault/	2025-01-13T02:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-13-at-10_55_37-AM.jpeg
Russian 'shadow fleet' tankers carrying 2 million barrels of crude idling off China’s coast, Bloomberg reports	Three tankers carrying over 2 million barrels of Russian crude oil are floating off China&apos;s coast after they were hit by fresh U.S. sanctions last week, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 13. The vessels are allegedly part of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers routinely used to evade sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s oil trade. This development follows the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s most extensive sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil sector, announced on Jan. 10. The measures target over 180 vessels in the shadow fleet, along with Russian oil companies and energy officials. The Huihai Pacific, Mermar, and Olia, each carrying Eastern Siberia&#x2013;Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude from Russia&apos;s Kozmino port, have diverted from their planned ports in China. The Huihai Pacific, initially headed for Dongjiakou in Shandong province, is now offshore, while the Mermar and Olia, bound for Yantai, are sitting in the Yellow Sea. Reuters reported on Jan. 8 that China&apos;s Shandong Port Group had prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province. The shadow fleet has also been implicated in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The U.S. Treasury&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified the tankers as key components of Russia&apos;s strategy to bypass restrictions on its oil exports. The sanctions aim to disrupt Moscow&apos;s ability to fund its war in Ukraine, which President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Jan. 10 a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot; China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. The mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shadow-fleet-tankers-china/	2025-01-13T01:20:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/3_6978bf53.png
Biden team preparing strong Ukraine policy foundation for Trump handover, Blinken says	The Biden administration is focused on securing a strong foreign policy foundation for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s incoming administration, including on the Russia-Ukraine war, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 12. According to Blinken, there is no sense in &quot;speculating on the point&quot; that the war may not end in Ukraine&apos;s favor under the new administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House on Jan. 20 has sparked concern about the future of the U.S. support for Ukraine. The president-elect has previously criticized military aid for Kyiv and pledged to broker a swift end to the war. &quot;What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it&apos;s on Ukraine or anything else,&quot; Blinken said. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a phone call soon, according to Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin are underway, though Waltz said the format of the talks remains undecided. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue but ruled out a face-to-face meeting before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Moscow previously rejected Trump&apos;s team&apos;s proposed peace plan, which included freezing front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying, &quot;I did all I could to help,&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-prepares-strong-ukraine-policy-handover-to-trump-blinken-says/	2025-01-13T01:00:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
Lithuania to deliver 4,500 drones to Ukraine this week	Lithuania is providing Ukraine with 4,500 drones worth 5 million euros ($5.1 million) in the coming days, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene announced on Jan. 12. Drones have proven crucial for both sides of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Kyiv employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of various types for reconnaissance and attack roles at the front lines and for long-range strikes in the Russian rear. Sakaliene&apos;s statement came shortly after the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT reported that thousands of drones, which were to be delivered to Ukraine several months ago, are still in Lithuanian warehouses as their delivery is delayed by bureaucratic obstacles. I am proud to share that Lithuania is sending 4,500 drones worth 5 million euros to Ukraine this week.In addition, during the last Government meeting, we approved a new faster procedure for transferring state assets. These changes will significantly reduce the time required for&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/332p7A4Q6D The previous Lithuanian government pledged in August that 5,000 Lithuanian-made drones would be delivered to Ukraine by fall. Separately, Vilnius also pledged to help fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s new Palianytsia missile-like drones. &quot;In addition, during the last government meeting, we approved a new faster procedure for transferring state assets,&quot; Sakaliene said, explaining that the changes &quot;will significantly reduce the time required for procedures, ensuring that aid reaches Ukraine faster.&quot; Lithuania has been one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, pledging to provide 0.25% of its GDP in military aid to Ukraine on a yearly basis. The Baltic country has supplied 840 million euros ($860 million) in security assistance to Ukraine as of October 2024, making it one of the leading donors in terms of GDP shares, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-to-deliver-4-500-drones-to-ukraine-this-week/	2025-01-13T00:50:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhHR1TmXYAAtcJo.jpeg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 17 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed one civilian and injured 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 13. Russian forces launched 110 drones at Ukraine overnight from the directions of Millerovo, Bryansk, Orel, and Primosk-Akhtarsk in Russia, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 78 drones in the Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi and Donetsk oblasts. Thirty-one drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Sumy Oblast: In Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center. No casualties were reported. An FPV drone strike in the Myropilska community damaged a bus and injured three civilians. As a result of artillery shelling, a fire broke out in a residential building in the Seredyna-Buda community, with one civilian injured, according to the regional military administration. Kherson Oblast: The Russian military attacked critical and social infrastructure facilities, as well as residential areas of the oblast&apos;s settlements.

Poland denies banning Slovak delegation's flight to Moscow through Polish airspace	The Polish Foreign Ministry denied claims by Slovak far-right lawmaker Andrej Danko that Warsaw did not permit a Slovak delegation to fly to Moscow through Polish airspace, the Polsat News channel reported on Jan. 12. &quot;We didn&apos;t refuse the flight; the Slovak side simply sent us incomplete documents... when they were asked to complete them, they informed us about the change of route,&quot; the Polish Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said. The delegation, led by Danko, Slovak National Party (SNS) chairman and deputy parliament speaker, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, arrived in Moscow on Jan. 12 to discuss Russian gas supplies to Slovakia. Russian-friendly nationalist Danko earlier accused Warsaw of preventing the flight from entering its airspace, forcing the plane to travel over Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates are expected to meet representatives of the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-denies-banning-slovak-delegations-flight-to-moscow-through-polish-airspace/	2025-01-12T23:15:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/473154311_18306837598206919_1258937468260133086_n.jpg
Lack of understanding of modern warfare' — Seoul reports 3,000 North Korean casualties in Russia's Kursk Oblast	At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13, according to the South Korean Yonhap news agency. The NIS attributed the high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &quot;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The NIS remarks follow President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s claim on Jan. 9 that North Korean forces fighting alongside Russian troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both killed and wounded. The NIS reported that North Korea has allegedly forced its soldiers to kill themselves to avoid capture by Ukrainian troops. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers had taken their own lives, fearing retaliation against their families if captured. On Jan. 11, Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, are now in the custody of Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) and receiving medical care. Zelensky shared video footage of the SBU interrogating the POWs with the assistance of Korean translators. In the video, one soldier expressed a desire to return to North Korea, while the other said he wished to remain in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-losses-kursk/	2025-01-12T22:55:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg

Russian drone strikes on Sumy Oblast spark fire at children's wellness center, 2 injured in attack on bus	Russian drones struck civilian infrastructure in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 12, leading to multiple casualties. In the regional capital Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. No casualties were reported as a result of the attack, and the extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Earlier in the day, around 3:15 p.m. local time, Russian forces used a drone to strike a civilian bus in the village of Myropillia, injuring two people, the Sumy Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported. Two women, aged 30 and 42, were injured in the attack. No details were provided on the status of the victims. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day. Throughout the day, Russia struck 13 communities across Sumy Oblast in 68 different attacks on the region, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive over the past year, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-on-sumy-oblast-sparks-fire-in-childrens-wellness-center-2-injured-in-attack-on-bus/	2025-01-12T18:41:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12_16-57-51.jpg
German Defense Minister denies Scholz blocked proposal for $3 billion arms package for Ukraine, says decision awaits	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius denied media reports that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), adding that a decision on the funding awaits. &quot;There is no blockade. We have prepared a new aid package for Ukraine in the Defense Ministry,&quot; Pistorius told Tagesspiegel in an interview published on Jan. 13. &quot;(A decision to approve the aid package) must now be decided politically... As soon as all questions have been clarified, I expect a corresponding decision,&quot; Pistorius added. Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources, that Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package, reportedly claiming that the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient support for Ukraine. Scholz also reportedly expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, according to Spiegel. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Following the media reports of the blockade on Jan. 10, Baerbock neither confirmed nor denied reports of the halt in aid. Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-defense-minister-denies-scholz-blocked-proposal-for-3-billion-arms-package-for-ukraine-says-decision-awaits/	2025-01-12T17:43:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Russian-friendly incumbent Zoran Milanovic re-elected president of Croatia	Croatia&apos;s populist incumbent president, Zoran Milanovic, was re-elected to the post by a wide margin on Jan. 12, election results show. Milanovic defeated Dragan Primorac, the candidate of Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic&#x2019;s HDZ party, by a margin of 74.7% to 25.3%, with 99% of polls reporting. The total turnout sat around 44% of eligible voters. Milanovic is a staunch critic of Western aid for Ukraine as well as the country&apos;s future accession into the military alliance. He previously referred to Ukraine&apos;s 2014 Euromaidan protests as a &quot;coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat&quot; and has railed against Western allies and Ukraine for not respecting the Minsk Agreements. In October, Milanovic refused to approve the participation of Croatian soldiers in NATO&apos;s mission to support Ukraine. Milanovic&apos;s re-election to the largely symbolic position serves as a setback for Plenkovic&#x2019;s government, whose government was recently embroiled in a corruption scandal implicating a former health minister. Milanovic, who served as Croatia&apos;s prime minister from 2011 to 2016 amid the country&apos;s accession into the European Union, was first elected to the presidency in 2020 with the support of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). &quot;This is the beginning of the end for Andrej Plenkovic,&quot; SDP leader Sinisa Hajdas Doncic said following Milanovic&apos;s victory. The Croatian government, mainly aligned with Plenkovic, has strongly supported military aid to Kyiv, including the delivery of 14 Mi-8 helicopters, and Plenkovic himself has made several visits to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-friendly-incumbent-zoran-milanovic-re-elected-president-of-croatia/	2025-01-12T16:09:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/gettyimages-2193017861-612x612.jpg
Sweden to increase military presence in Baltic Sea following suspected cable sabotage	Sweden will increase its military presence in the Baltic Sea through the deployment of three warships and a radar reconnaissance aircraft in response to the suspected sabotage of several underwater cables, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Jan. 12. &quot;These warships are placed under NATO command and they are used to create better conditions for a maritime situation picture in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Kristersson said on the sidelines of a security conference in Salen. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. Sweden&apos;s decisions follows soon after a decision announced by nearby NATO allies Finland and Estonia to send a fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. NATO previously said it is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Finland will host a summit for NATO member states with access to the Baltic Sea on Jan. 14 to address regional security threats, including the suspected Russian sabotage, the Finnish president&apos;s office announced on Jan. 8.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-increase-military-presence-in-baltic-sea-following-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-12T14:54:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1839741170.jpg
Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives' — Zelensky says Kyiv ready to send firefighters to California	Ukraine is preparing to send rescuers, including 150 firefighters, to the U.S. state of California to help combat the wildfires that have devastated the region in recent days, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Wildfires have ravaged the city of Los Angeles in the past week, killing at least 16 people, displacing hundreds of thousands of residents, and destroying or damaging over 10,000 structures. &quot;Today, I instructed Ukraine&apos;s Interior Minister and our diplomats to prepare for the possible participation of our rescuers in combating the wildfires in California,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan 12. &quot;The situation there is extremely challenging, and Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives. This matter is being worked out, and through appropriate channels, we have offered our assistance to the American side. We already have 150 firefighters prepared.&quot; Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko and a team of diplomats are looking into the situation, the ministry said. Zelensky&apos;s offer of assistance comes three days after Donald Trump Jr., son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, responded to the Los Angeles wildfires by blaming Ukraine on social media. &quot;Oh look of course the LA fire department donated a bunch of their supplies to Ukraine,&quot; Trump. Jr. said in a post on X on Jan. 8. The Los Angeles County Fire Department sent surplus materials to Ukraine back in 2022, following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The aid included boots, hoses, body armor, and medication. The donation did not likely impact the response to the current crisis, which has been exacerbated by strong winds, personnel issues, and water shortages.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-can-help-americans-protect-lives-zelensky-says-kyiv-ready-to-send-firefighters-to-california/	2025-01-12T14:31:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192311233.jpg
Serbian president offers to host Trump-Putin meeting in Belgrade	Serbia will officially offer to host the upcoming meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in a television broadcast on Jan. 12. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin were already underway, but no concrete details have been made public. Belgrade is ready to host the future meeting and can guarantee appropriate security for both leaders, Vucic told the Serbian Broadcasting Corporation (RTS). &quot;(Serbia) is the country where President Trump had the greatest support in all of Europe,&quot; Vucic said. &quot;There is no country that can compare to Serbia in terms of the level of support for President Trump. ... And on the other hand, it is a country where President Putin is still very, very popular. So, I think that this is a place on the globe that would be extremely suitable for both of them.&quot; Serbia is well-suited to host Trump and Putin because it is not a member of any military alliances, such as NATO, Vucic said. Serbia maintains a friendly attitude toward Russia and has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Vucic has called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and previously affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are Ukrainian sovereign territories. Switzerland has also put itself forward as a potential site for the Trump-Putin talks. Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss media on Jan. 12 that Switzerland had already communicated its willingness to host the meeting. The framework of the upcoming meeting is still being determined, incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Jan. 12. A phone call between Trump and Putin to work out the details is expected &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; The Kremlin has said a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will have to wait until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbian-president-offers-to-host-trump-putin-meeting-in-belgrade/	2025-01-12T13:06:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192588495.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 13 to Jan. 20. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. With 8 eight days left until the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump, global policy makers are ramping up preparations for what a Trump 2 presidency could bring. Although the incoming administration has hardly been quite (incl. with concerning statements on NATO, Greenland, Canada and the Panama canal), the coming weeks will provide an indication on what is posturing and what is policy &#x2013; and what decisions need to be made. Military planning and security, as well as the viability of major global alliances, will be a key theme. On Jan. 13 NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will attend a joint committee meeting at the European Parliament. The session takes place amid questions about the US commitment to European security (a live stream of Rutte&#x2019;s remarks and session transcript will be available on the NATO website). Jan. 15-16 NATO&#x2019;s Military Committee will convene in Brussels. The meeting will bring together Allied Chiefs of Defense and over 20 counterparts from NATO Partner nations to discuss strategic issues and foster cooperation in addressing global challenges. The first session will feature General Cavoli, the United States European Command commander, briefing on NATO&#x2019;s readiness to deter and defend the Euro-Atlantic region while safeguarding its one billion inhabitants. Discussions will explore NATO&#x2019;s ongoing missions and support for Ukraine, including the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which has taken on responsibilities to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Rutte will join the opening session to outline key priorities and challenges for the alliance. The Ad Hoc Working Party on the Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine will convene at the European Council headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 17. This meeting will bring together representatives from EU member states, international organizations, and other stakeholders to coordinate strategies for providing aid and supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s immediate financing needs and its long-term economic recovery and reconstruction efforts. In global news, on Jan. 14 South Korea&#x2019;s Constitutional Court will begin the impeachment trial of President Yoon Suk Yeol (he will not attend, being &#x201C;holed up&#x201D; in his residence to avoid arrest). South Korea&#x2019;s internal turmoil complicates support to Ukraine, which was set to ramp up due to North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war. In the latest chapter of France&#x2019;s tumultuous internal politics, the new centrist Prime Minister Fran&#xE7;ois Bayrou is expected to lay out his policy priorities on Tuesday Jan. 14 in his first address to the French parliament. A driving force of political disruption, TikTok is set to shut down in the US on Jan. 19 unless President-elect Donald Trump finds a way to save the platform. The Supreme Court has signaled it will uphold the ban, which could impact 170 mn US users. Looking forward, the diplomatic year will kick off in full swing with the World Economic Forum&#x2019;s Annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 20-24. Of note, Ukraine will enter a period of mostly painful historical anniversaries, starting with the Jan. 19 Hrushevskoho street riots (a turning point in the EuroMaidan revolution, following the passage of anti-protest &#x201C;dictatorial&#x201D; laws) and the Unity Day on Jan. 22 (when the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic formed a short-lived, independent union). This period will continue through Feb. 24, which will mark 3 years of full-scale war against Russia.

Ukraine ready to return North Korean POWs to Kim Jong Un or find 'other ways,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is prepared to send captured North Korean soldiers home if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Alternatively, Kyiv is willing to explore other options for North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, he said. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come a day after the president announced on Jan. 11 that Ukrainain forces had captured two North Korean POWs in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The wounded soldiers are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and are reportedly receiving medical attention. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot; Ukraine is prepared to return North Korean personnel in future prisoner exchanges or explore &quot;other ways&quot; of handling those captured soldiers who do not want to go back to North Korea, according to Zelensky. &quot;Ukraine is ready to hand over his people to Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for our soldiers who are held captive in Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways. In particular, those Koreans who wish to bring peace closer by spreading the truth in Korean about this war will have this opportunity.&quot; Zelensky posted video footage of the SBU&apos;s interrogation of the two POWs, mediated by Korean translators. In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. Some 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. North Korean personnel have suffered high casualties while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Zelensky said on Jan. 11 that the capture of the North Korean POWs was a difficult task to carry out, as Russian and North Korean forces go to greath lengths to suppress evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-return-north-korean-pows-to-kim-jong-un-or-find-other-ways-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T12:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-36--2-.jpg
Fico refused Kyiv's offers to help with gas supplies, Zelensky says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico refused Ukraine&apos;s offers of assistance following the discontinuation of Russian gas flows via Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Zelensky&apos;s comments come shortly after Fico lambasted Ukraine as an unreliable partner and accused Zelensky of &quot;begging and blackmailing&quot; European leaders. &quot;We offered our assistance to the people of Slovakia during their adaptation to the absence of Russian gas transit, but Fico arrogantly refused,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on X. &quot;Many in Europe warned him that doing nothing and waiting was not an option. Now, he&apos;s resorting to PR, lies, and loud accusations to shift the blame away from himself onto someone else.&quot; Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Slovakia, still heavily reliant on Russian gas even as other EU countries find alternative energy providers, harshly criticized Ukraine&apos;s decision. Fico has threatened to cut off humanitarian aid and electricity supplies to Ukraine in retaliation. Zelensky condemned Fico&apos;s threat, accusing him of opening &quot;a second energy front against Ukraine&quot; at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22, a week before the transit deal was set to expire. A delegation of Slovak far-right MPs also departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on continuing gas supplies and other issues. Zelensky said that Fico&apos;s refusal to find an alternative energy supplier was the result of his misplaced loyalty to Russia. &quot;But the real problem is that he bet on Moscow, not on his own country, not on a united Europe, and certainly not on common sense,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;From the beginning, it was a losing bet.&quot; Zelensky said he hoped that Europe and the U.S. would collaborate effectively to diversify energy supplies to Europe and &#xA0;&quot;address the challenges caused by the shortsightedness of certain European figures.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-refused-kyivs-offers-to-help-with-gas-supplies-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T11:19:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Far-right Slovak delegation flies to Moscow for talks on Russian gas supplies	A group of far-right Slovak MPs departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on the continuation of Russian gas supplies and other issues, the Slovak news agency TASR reported. The visit comes weeks after Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Dec. 22. The delegation is led by Andrej Danko, the chair of the co-ruling far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) and current deputy speaker of parliament, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, TASR reported. Danko, a Russian-friendly nationalist, said on Jan. 5 that the visit aims to &quot;restore some relations with Russia.&quot; Danko also claimed that Poland refused to allow the delegation&apos;s flight to enter their airspace, and that their plane had to be rerouted via Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates will reportedly meet with representatives from the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-slovak-delegation-flies-to-moscow-for-talks-on-russian-gas-supplies/	2025-01-12T10:19:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/danko-1.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: 'Irrefutable evidence of North Korea's involvement' — Ukraine says it captured 2 North Korean POWs in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 12: Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes nearly two weeks after the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that Ukrainian troops had captured a wounded North Korean soldier in late December who died soon of his wounds. &quot;We confirmed through a friendly nation&apos;s intelligence organization that a North Korean soldier, captured alive on Dec. 26, died a short while ago as (his) wounds worsened,&quot; the NIS said on Dec. 27, as cited by South Korean Yonhap News Agency. Applauding the &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of North Korean soldiers&apos; participation in the Russian war against Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 11 that the POWs are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine. Russian troops have carried out a double airstrike on a nursing home in the Ukrainian-occupied Russian town of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, said on Jan. 12. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, the attack, which took place on the evening of Jan. 11, left one woman with severe arm injuries, who died later in the morning of Jan. 12. The attack also dealt heavy damage to the nursing home, with all windows and doors blown out, Dmytrashkivskyi added, speaking on national television. According to him, around 2,000 Russian civilians remain in areas under Ukrainian control. Over 70 people are currently staying in the nursing home that came under attack. &quot;The question now is where to relocate these people. Most are elderly, and many suffer from disabilities, Parkinson&apos;s disease, post-stroke conditions, and one individual has a mental illness. The current state of these people is quite severe,&quot; the spokesperson said. In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha organized by the Ukrainian military. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Russian troops have been spotted dressing in civilian clothing to mask their movements in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s 28th Mechanized Brigade reported on Jan. 12. Aerial reconnaissance footage posted by the brigade on Facebook shows a couple of alleged Russian soldiers dressed in civilian clothes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the images. The brigade said it was &quot;another violation of the rules of warfare&quot; by Russian troops, as it can be classified as a war crime under international law. According to the brigade, Russian infantrymen &quot;attempt to divert attention and disguise themselves&quot; in this way. &quot;However, they are exposed by their identical clothing, behavior, and sometimes even their weapons,&quot; the brigade wrote. &quot;Nevertheless, this still complicates the work of our soldiers, as the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not &apos;shoot at everything that moves,&apos; unlike (Russian) occupiers.&quot; Back in September, Ukraine accused Russian forces of 137,000 war crimes carried out as part of its full-scale invasion. Crimes include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of residents in occupied territories, and the murder of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). Earlier on Jan. 6, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, reported that Russian troops had allegedly killed three Ukrainian POWs in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-irrefutable-evidence-of-north-koreas-involvement-ukraine-says-it-captured-2-north-korean-pows-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-12T09:28:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/uwl.jpeg
Trump, Putin call expected in near future, incoming national security adviser says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks,&quot; Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, told ABC News on Jan. 12. Waltz&apos;s comments come shortly after Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting between the two leaders were already in the works. &quot;The preparations are underway,&quot; Waltz told ABC News in response to a question about the upcoming meeting. &quot;You can&apos;t enter a deal if you don&apos;t have some type of relationship or dialogue with the other side and we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.&quot; Waltz did not set a date for the planned meeting. When asked if the talks would include President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the format of the meeting had not yet been determined. &quot;Well, we haven&apos;t set the exact framework for it yet, we&apos;re working on that, but I do expect a call, at least in the coming days and weeks, so that would be a step, and we&apos;ll take it from there,&quot; Waltz said. Switzerland has indicated its willingness to host an in-person meeting between Trump and Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, said on Jan. 12. Waltz did not provide any information on where the upcoming meeting might take place. The Kremlin on Jan. 10 said it &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, but said no concrete plans had been made and a face-to-face meeting would not occur until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Moscow has previously rejected the terms of a peace proposal leaked by Trump&apos;s team, one that involved freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground. While Waltz did not go into specifics regarding the content of the talks or plans for peace, he did mention Ukraine&apos;s &quot;manpower issues&quot; and said Kyiv could resolve them by lowering the draft age from 26 to 18. &quot;If Ukrainians have asked the entire world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy ... We need to see those manpower issues addressed,&quot; he said. Waltz also said it wasn&apos;t &quot;realistic&quot; to expect a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied regions of Ukraine, including Crimea. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-call-expected-in-near-future-incoming-national-security-adviser-says/	2025-01-12T08:55:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg

(TRO Media/Courtesy)In a comment to the Kyiv Indpendent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. Earlier on Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-double-airstrike-on-nursing-home-in-kursk-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-12T06:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_003.jpeg
Switzerland ready to host Trump-Putin meeting	Switzerland has expressed its readiness to host a high-level meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss newspaper Le Temps. According to the publication, Bideau referenced the global peace summit held in Switzerland in June, saying that following the summit, Ukraine, Russia, and the United States have been regularly informed of Switzerland&apos;s willingness to facilitate diplomatic initiatives. &quot;Following the B&#xFC;rgenstock summit, Ukraine, Russia and the United States were regularly informed of our willingness to support diplomatic efforts to find peace,&quot; Bideau said, as quoted by Le Temps. Bideau&#x2019;a address comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect also said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. However, one obstacle to a Trump-Putin meeting could be an arrest warrant that the International Criminal Court issued for Putin in March 2023, for allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has forcibly deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children since the start of the full-scale war. Less than 400 have been brought back to Ukraine. As a signatory to the Rome Statute, Switzerland is legally required to arrest Putin. According to Le Temps, Bideau said the Federal Council has the authority to grant exceptions in situations involving peace negotiations. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia is grappling with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, exceeding all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-ready-to-host-trump-putin-meeting/	2025-01-12T03:34:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Over 130 people, including 12 children, evacuated from Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11	Over the past day, 132 people, including 12 children, were evacuated from the front-line area of Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Amid fierce Russian offensives and daily attacks on the area, Donetsk Oblast authorities intensified evacuation efforts during the summer and autumn, with police, military, and volunteers helping civilians flee the region. However, despite calls from officials, as of early January, around 307,000 civilians reportedly remained in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk Oblast. According to Filashkin, Russian troops shelled the settlements of Donetsk Oblast 20 times over the past day, killing one person in the village of Hryshyne, not far from Pokrovsk. Five people were injured in the village of Bilytske and two more in Kostiantynivka, Filashkin wrote on Facebook. The aftermath of Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11.

Ukraine downs 60 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 60 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Russia launched a total of 94 Shahed-type and decoy drones from the areas of its Millerovo, Oryol, Bryansk, and Kursk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of the 34 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the attack ones. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, and Donetsk oblasts. Falling debris from downed drones caused damage to several residential houses in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, the Air Force said. However, there were no casualties. Russian drone attacks across Ukraine surged to record levels in the last months of 2024, with Moscow aiming to ramp up UAV production in the new year. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. On Dec. 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 glide bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks. Even on Christmas night, Russia organized a massive air attack,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing footage of the destruction across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-60-russian-drones-overnight-air-force-reports/	2025-01-12T00:27:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg

Transnistria eases blackouts amid gas shortage	Authorities in Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria announced on Jan. 11 that energy-saving measures have allowed them to ease restrictions caused by a halt of Russian gas supplies. The duration of rolling blackouts is set to decrease further. Moldova&apos;s pro-European central government said Moscow is responsible for the energy crisis. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse, has historically relied on Russian gas transported via Ukraine. The region has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. The Russian state energy company Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, as Ukraine declined to extend a gas transit agreement into 2025, triggering an energy emergency in the Russian-occupied region. The self-proclaimed authorities in Transnistria never paid Gazprom for the gas they consumed, while Moscow continued to charge Moldova for it. Chisinau refused to cover the cost. Transnistria&apos;s Russian-installed officials reported on the region&apos;s Telegram channel that rolling blackouts, initially lasting eight hours earlier this week, were cut to five hours on Jan. 10 and would be reduced to three hours on Sunday. First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Obolonik said: &quot;With current super efficiencies in consumption, Transnistria has enough gas until the end of January.&quot; To manage the shortages, many factories have shifted to night shifts to reduce grid strain. However, a cement factory in Rybnitsa has shut down, along with a critical steel mill in another city, according to Reuters. Russian gas to Transnistria powers a thermal plant that supplies electricity to the separatist region and much of Moldova&apos;s government-controlled areas. Daniel Voda, press secretary for Moldova&apos;s central government, criticized Moscow&apos;s role in the crisis, adding that Russia uses energy as a political weapon. &quot;Every time that Russia wants to show its might, it cuts off vital resources and turns people into hostages,&quot; Voda reportedly said. &quot;This is an experiment using people that shows that Moscow is not worried about residents&#x2019; comfort and security. ... No one deserves to live in fear and in the cold.&quot; Although the Moldovan government has offered assistance to help Transnistria address its energy shortages, the region&apos;s leadership denies receiving any formal proposals.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-eases-blackouts-amid-gas-shortage/	2025-01-11T20:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russia condemns new US sanctions on energy sector, says it will continue oil and gas projects	Russia criticized the latest U.S. sanctions targeting its energy sector on Jan. 11, describing them as an effort to harm Russia&apos;s economy while risking instability in global markets. Despite this, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry said Russia would continue pursuing major oil and gas projects. The ministry condemned Washington&apos;s &quot;hostile&quot; actions, announced on Jan. 10, and noted that Russia would craft its foreign policy strategy in response. The ministry argued the sanctions represented &quot;an attempt to inflict at least some damage to the Russian economy, even at the cost of the risk of destabilising world markets as the end approaches of President Joe Biden&apos;s inglorious tenure in power.&quot; The sanctions mark the most extensive U.S. measures yet against Russia&apos;s oil and gas revenue streams. They aim to provide Kyiv and the incoming administration of Donald Trump with leverage to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and 183 vessels involved in transporting Russian oil, many of which belong to the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies. Combined, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the sanctions, saying they would &quot;deliver a significant blow&quot; to Russia. &quot;The less revenue Russia earns from oil ... the sooner peace will be restored,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-new-us-sanctions-on-energy-sector-says-it-will-continue-oil-and-gas-projects/	2025-01-11T17:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1601789399.jpg
EU to start drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, media reports	The European Commission plans to begin drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, with the goal of approving the package on Feb. 24 &#x2014; the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Polish RMF FM reports. Starting Jan. 14, the European Commission will hold consultations with EU member states on the 16th sanctions package, according to European diplomats. During these discussions, EU ambassadors will share their proposals and address concerns related to the upcoming measures. Once this process is complete, the European Commission will present its own proposals, which require unanimous support from all EU countries. Poland, currently holding the EU presidency, is pushing for the sanctions package to be finalized by the war&apos;s anniversary on Feb. 24. Slovakia and Hungary are likely to oppose the new sanctions package, complicating the process, according to the outlet. The EU approved its 15th package against Moscow on Dec. 16. That package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea as well as shipping companies helping Russia to sell its crude oil, filling Moscow&apos;s coffers amid the full-scale war. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-start-drafting-new-sanctions-against-russia-next-week-media-reports/	2025-01-11T15:56:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1882258789.jpg
Ukrainian drone hits large oil refinery in Russia’s Tatarstan, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation confirms	A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-hits-large-oil-refinery-in-russias-tatarstan-head-of-ukraines-center-for-countering-disinformation-confirms/	2025-01-11T13:11:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/astra.jpg
Fico accuses Zelensky of 'begging' and 'blackmailing' European leaders for support	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico called Ukraine an unreliable partner and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of blackmailing European leaders for support at a parliamentary meeting on Jan. 10. &quot;He [Zelensky] goes around Europe, just begging and blackmailing others, asking for money,&#x201D; he said. Fico posted a video from the meeting on his Facebook page afterward, with some of his quotes. The meeting, convened by the opposition, sought explanations for Fico&#x2019;s recent meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and questioned Slovakia&#x2019;s future energy policies. Fico claimed that Zelensky disrupted a gas transit agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan that would have benefited Slovakia. Kyiv terminated Russian gas transit on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. Slovakia, which had previously imported Russian gas through Ukraine, has voiced concerns over the decision&apos;s economic impact. Fico said that Slovakia could halt its humanitarian aid to Ukraine, cut or cancel social benefits for Ukrainian refugees, and cease emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. He also suggested using Slovakia&apos;s veto power over EU decisions as leverage against Kyiv. &quot;It just has to stop,&quot; he said, and added that he was sometimes &quot;fed up with&#x201D; Zelensky. Fico then described Russia as a reliable energy partner, stating, &quot;Russia has never deceived us, unlike Ukraine.&quot; He also recalled a 2009 incident where he claimed Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership refused to supply Slovakia with gas during a crisis, referring to it as &quot;typical Ukrainians.&quot; Fico met with Putin at the Kremlin during a visit on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies. The visit by the Russian-friendly leader was heavily criticized by EU and Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-zelensky-of-begging-and-blackmailing-european-leaders-for-support/	2025-01-11T11:04:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Taliban-led Afghanistan became leading purchaser of Russian flour in 2024	Afghanistan became the largest importer of Russian flour in 2024, Russia&apos;s state agricultural export agency Agroexport reported on Jan. 10. The purchases doubled, compared to the previous year, to nearly $80 million. This surge aligns with Russia&#x2019;s efforts to strengthen ties with the Taliban government, including recent steps toward officially recognizing the regime. Afghanistan depends on imported flour due to limited domestic production capacity. Russia&#x2019;s overall flour exports reached $300 million in 2024, with China and Turkmenistan also among the top buyers. Russia has maintained contact with the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan without officially recognizing the new authorities. Russia&apos;s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Afghanistan on Nov. 25, saying that the removal of the Taliban from the list of terrorist groups is in its &quot;final stage.&quot; &quot;Let me confirm our readiness to establish a constructive political dialogue between our countries and among the goals would be providing an impulse for the process of a settlement among Afghans,&quot; Shoigu reportedly said. &quot;We have tried to ensure conditions for a growth in exports of Afghan goods and a growth in foreign investment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/taliban-led-afghanistan-became-leading-purchaser-of-russian-flour-in-2024/	2025-01-11T10:18:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1233884544.jpg
41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier killed in Luhansk Oblast on Christmas	Edgars Platonovs, a 41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action in December on the eastern front, the Latvian Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. Platonovs was fighting in the areas near the village of Novoiehorivka in the largely Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast as part of the Ukrainian military&apos;s International Legion, composed of mostly foreign volunteers, according to the Latvian Armed Forces. The military said that the volunteer was killed on Dec. 25, 2024. Platonovs&apos; death is among the huge costs that Ukraine and those helping the country have had to pay to fend off the relentless Russian offensives since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Many foreign fighters &#x2013;&#xA0;like Platonovs &#x2013; were killed and wounded in Ukraine, but Kyiv has not disclosed the casualty figures. &quot;Another of our volunteer soldiers has died defending the freedom and independence of Ukraine. Our deepest condolences to the relatives and comrades of Edgars Platonovs,&quot; Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media platform X, adding: &quot;Eternal memory to the hero!&quot; Unlike many other foreign volunteers, Platonovs had not served in the Latvian Armed Forces before arriving in Ukraine. His family praised him as a &quot;loving son, our older, strong and caring brother, who always did everything with all his heart and conviction,&quot; as cited by Delfi news website. &quot;Edgars was a kind, sincere and always positive person who never lost faith in himself and his principles,&quot; his family said, according to Delfi. Earlier in October 2023, a Russian drone attack had killed another Lithuanian &#x2013; 28-year-old Vitalijs Smirnovs &#x2013; in the Lyman area of Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/41-year-old-latvian-volunteer-soldier-killed-in-luhansk-oblast-on-christmas/	2025-01-11T07:58:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Latvia-1.jpeg
West must show Putin that 'Russia is no longer an empire,' Boris Johnson says	The West must get it across to Vladimir Putin that Russia is no longer an empire, former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in an online interview with Delfi published on Jan. 10, calling the Russian leader a &quot;f***ing idiot.&quot; Johnson made a parallel to the British Empire, saying that though almost nothing is left of the once-greatest empire in the world, the U.K. is content in its post-imperialist role. Talking in the context of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the ex-prime minister called for Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and criticized the alliance&apos;s &quot;chronically ambiguous&quot; approach toward Kyiv. In office between 2019 and 2022, Johnson was one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine at the onset of the full-scale invasion, visiting the country several times during the war. The former head of the British government told the Baltic news outlet that Russia&apos;s war is &quot;archaic and barbaric&quot; and that Moscow needs to learn that Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries are also not part of the Russian empire anymore. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nears its third anniversary, Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory. Moscow illegally declared the annexation of four partially occupied regions in September 2022, in addition to Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula seized in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-must-understand-that-russia-is-no-longer-an-empire-boris-johnson-says/	2025-01-11T07:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184238205.jpg
Ukraine mulls buying Italian air defenses with frozen Russian assets' proceeds	Kyiv and Rome are discussing the possibility of purchasing Italian-made air defense systems and ammunition using profits from immobilized Russian assets, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 11. &quot;We are interested, among other things, in ammunition of various calibers and air defense systems,&quot; Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Anatolii Klochko said after talks with Italian defense officials. Italy delivered a highly advanced SAMP/T system to Ukraine in cooperation with France in 2023. The second system was said to have been in late September 2024. Last December, the Italian government approved a decree extending Italy&apos;s military support for Ukraine through the year 2025. The Western countries and other partners immobilized around $300 billion in sovereign Russian assets placed in their bank accounts at the start of the full-scale war. While Kyiv called for the full confiscation of these funds, the G7 has instead announced a $50 billion loan for Ukraine that will be paid back through profits generated by the frozen assets. The funds will be used for the country&apos;s reconstruction and military needs. The scheme allows Ukraine to obtain arms without relying on Western donations or further straining its already tight budget.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wants-to-buy-italian-air-defenses-with-russian-frozen-asset-proceeds/	2025-01-11T05:59:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/whatsapp-image-2025-01-11-at-10-25-46-95670da282.webp
Ukraine captures 2 North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2013; North Korea &#x2013; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-captured-2-north-korean-soldiers-as-pows-in-russias-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2025-01-11T04:11:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34.jpg
Putin to push for barring Ukraine's NATO accession in expected talks with Trump, FT reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s main goals in any peace negotiations include prohibiting Ukraine from ever entering NATO and reducing allied military presence in the eastern flank, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 10, citing a former Kremlin official and a source who discussed the matter with Putin. The news comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect said previously that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Nevertheless, Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader, prompting fears he might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Putin&apos;s two reported main goals mirror demands raised by Moscow shortly before the start of the full-scale invasion. The Biden administration and NATO allies rejected the demands at the time. Ukraine has ramped up its efforts to join the alliance after the outbreak of the full-scale war, calling in the best possible guarantee that Russia will not resume its aggression in the future. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Ukraine could enter NATO gradually, with the collective defense principle initially not extending to occupied territories. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia grapples with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, outpacing all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-push-for-barring-ukraines-nato-accession-in-potential-talks-with-trump-ft-reports/	2025-01-11T04:01:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg
Germany towing disabled tanker from Russia's 'shadow fleet' in Baltic Sea	Germany said on Jan. 11 that it had established towing connections with a disabled tanker Eventin, which it said was part of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to avert sanctions, to prevent an oil spill in the Baltic Sea. &quot;The towing convoy is moving eastwards to a position northeast of Cape Arkona (R&#xFC;gen),&quot; Germany&apos;s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said, referring to the German island in the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea. &quot;The emergency command is continuously assessing the situation in order to be able to react to any changes,&quot; the command said, adding that the towing convoy is moving at the speed of 2.5 kilometers per hour, navigating through strong winds. Russia has used murky ships for oil exports to circumvent sanctions imposed by Western nations for waging its brutal war against Ukraine. The Panamanian-flagged tanker, loaded with about 99,000 tons of oil, was sailing from Russia to Egypt, according to the CCME. The tanker was unable to maneuver since Jan. 10 and has been slowly drifting in the Baltic Sea coastal waters, north of R&#xFC;gen, the CCME said in its daily updates. Speaking to the press on Jan. 10, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed Russia for threatening European security with its use of &quot;dilapidated oil tankers,&quot; AFP reported. &quot;By ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not only circumventing the sanctions, but is also willingly accepting that tourism on the Baltic Sea will come to a standstill&quot; if an accident occurs, Baerbock said, as cited by AFP. The reports of the stricken vessel come a month after two Russian tankers were damaged by a storm in December in the Kerch Strait. The vessels, each reportedly carrying 4,000 tons of fuel, began leaking into the Black Sea. Russia has caused massive environmental damage in and outside Ukraine, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam in June 2023 and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farmland. Germany said that no oil leaks had been detected after the Jan. 10 incident. By the time of the publication, it was unclear whether there were suspicions of sabotage that may have caused the adrift. &#xA0; &quot;Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, the dark fleet of old vessels that lack proper insurance, have opaque ownership, and &apos;flag hop&apos; between different permissive ship registries has grown explosively, to an estimated 1,400 ships,&quot; the U.S.-think tank Atlantic Council wrote in its January 2024 report. &quot;Their presence poses considerable risk to other ships, to the environment, and to countries experiencing maritime accidents caused by the vessels,&quot; it added.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-towing-shadow-fleet-tanker/	2025-01-11T03:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192693454.jpg
Police dismantle almost 50 illegal border crossing schemes in massive crackdown	The Ukrainian National Police broke up nearly 50 schemes for draft-age Ukrainian men to illegally cross the border, the police said on Jan. 11 after a large-scale operation. The announcement follows 600 simultaneous raids across the country on Jan. 10 aimed at preventing fighting-age men from fleeing abroad. Ukraine prohibits men aged 18-60 from leaving the country under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in 2022. Sixty suspects were charged in schemes that included crossing the border outside of checkpoints, forging health documents, and inputting falsified entries into an electronic information system, the police said. The defendants included heads of state institutions, hospital managers, military enlistment officers, medical commission officials, and ordinary civilians. According to the statement, men seeking to leave the country paid between $5,000 and $22,000 to the suspects to help them cross the border. The suspects face up to nine years in prison, property confiscation, and a ban on holding certain official positions. The police noted that this concludes the first stage of the operation, as efforts to identify other suspects are underway. Though Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko admitted last June that dozens of men try to illegally cross the border every day, Ukrainian authorities have largely avoided providing exact figures. According to the Romanian police, 11,000 Ukrainian men have illegally crossed the border into Romania between the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and May 2024. As many as 23,500 illegally entered Moldova between February 2022 and last July, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Illegal border crossing schemes only deepen the manpower shortages facing the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which then struggle to hold back the Russian advance in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-dismantle-almost-50-illegal-border-crossing-schemes/	2025-01-11T02:49:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/15d5fb17d4c126d08e08ecb6d52de769.jpg
Norway to build bomb shelters amid growing threat from Russia	Norway proposed on Jan. 10 to build new bomb shelters and over 100 other measures to bolster civil preparedness amid Russian aggression in Ukraine and rising global security challenges. Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine and its increasingly belligerent rhetoric toward the West prompted warnings across NATO about a possible clash with Moscow in the coming years. NATO member Norway shares a 200-kilometer-long (over 120 miles) border with Russia in the Arctic Circle. Norway&apos;s new total preparedness report instructs the government to ask the parliament to repeal a 1998 decision to halt the construction of bomb shelters and construct new ones. The new shelters will be built in complexes larger than 1,000 square meters. Some will be designed to withstand conventional attacks, while others should protect the population against radioactive or chemical weapons. The government will also increase the number of Civil Defense conscripts from 8,000 to 12,000 over the next eight years, set up emergency food storages to last three months, propose compulsory civilian service during a security crisis or war, and draft preparedness plans and strategies. The report was compiled in a &quot;serious security situation characterized by Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, and the global competition between great powers over military, political, economic, and technological dominance,&quot; the Norwegian government said in a statement. &quot;This is a turning point for Norway&apos;s total civil preparedness. We are leaving behind the period we had lived in since the 1990s after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall when the preparedness was based on stable peace,&quot; Justice Minister Emile Enger Mehl said. &quot;Going forward, we must prepare for a new era.&quot; Other countries in Russia&apos;s vicinity have moved to bolster their preparedness in the event of a conflict. Lithuania drafted evacuation plans to relocate a quarter of its population in the case of war. In light of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, civil preparedness measures have been under review also in Latvia and Estonia.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-build-bomb-shelters-amid-russias-threat/	2025-01-11T02:00:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238737954.jpg
Ukraine's Legion in Poland has received 1,300 applications; first women join the unit	Almost 1,300 Ukrainians living in Poland, Denmark, Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, and other European countries have applied to join the Poland-based Ukrainian Legion, the Defense Ministry said on Jan. 10. The legion was unveiled in July 2024 as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainians living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened last October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The ministry announced on Jan. 10 that the second group of volunteers had already signed contracts in Lublin. For the first time, the new recruits included women who applied for medical and communications roles. &quot;Today, we accepted more recruits into the unit&apos;s ranks than in November,&quot; said Lieutenant Colonel Petro Pokrusha, a representative of the legion&apos;s command. &quot;This shows the growing confidence of our citizens in this initiative.&quot; The ministry has not revealed the number of contracts concluded so far. After signing their contracts, new volunteers began training at the Polish Armed Forces&apos; facilities under Polish instructors and using modern NATO weaponry. The legion was launched as a way to engage Ukrainians living abroad in Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia&apos;s invasion amid increasingly critical manpower shortages. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to their place of residence abroad after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-legion-in-poland-has-received-1-300-applications/	2025-01-11T01:12:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1659460683.jpg
Russia claims it downed 85 Ukrainian drones; 2 apartment buildings reportedly damaged	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 11 that its air defense had intercepted or destroyed 85 Ukrainian drones flying into Russia overnight. In one of the regions that Moscow claimed it successfully countered a Ukrainian drone attack, the local authorities said that a drone crashed into two five-floor apartment buildings in the town of Kotovsk in western Russia. The damage was minimal, but three people were lightly injured by broken glass, according to Tambov Oblast Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify all of the claims. Using its homemade drones, Ukraine has targeted military sites, airfields, and oil refineries deep in Russia to counter a much larger foe by trying to disrupt logistics in the rear. The Ukrainian side rarely reveals information about its attacks in Russia, making it difficult to assess the scale of the attacks. Footage that purports to show the aftermath of a drone crashing into a apartment building in Kotovsk, Tambov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Jan. 11, 2025. (Astra/Telegram)The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 31 drones were destroyed over the Black Sea, 16 over Voronezh Oblast and Krasnodar Krai, 14 over the Azov Sea, four over Belgorod Oblast, two over Tambov Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast, and one over the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The intense Ukrainian long-range drone attacks over 2024 showed Russian air defense vulnerabilities. &quot;From what we can tell &#x2014; it&apos;s no longer a secret &#x2014; Ukrainian long-range unmanned aerial vehicles can hypothetically operate up to 2,000 kilometers,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said on Dec. 27, 2024. In turn, Russia regularly targets Ukrainian cities, villages, and infrastructure with drones and missiles, often resulting in civilian casualties. Two civilians were killed and 12 injured over the past day, Ukrainian authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-it-downed-85-ukrainian-drones-flying-in-overnight/	2025-01-11T00:46:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Gg_iV2UWgAAwV8Z.jpeg
US Congress should ensure that Ukraine aid continues even under Trump, Biden says	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said on Jan. 10 he did all he could to help Ukraine and voiced hope that U.S. support will continue even after he leaves office. &quot;There is a significant number of Democrats and Republicans on the (Capitol) Hill who think we should continue to support Ukraine,&quot; Biden said during his remarks on the state of the U.S. economy. &quot;It is my hope and expectation they&apos;ll speak up and not agree to if president... if (U.S. President-elect Donald) Trump decides to cut off funding for Ukraine.&quot; Trump is set to return to the White House on Jan. 20. His reelection sparked concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine as the president-elect has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration over funneling assistance to the embattled country. After his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine, aiming to use the support instead as leverage to push for quicker peace talks. Biden said that during his time in office, he did &quot;everything (he) possibly could&quot; to &quot;give Ukraine every advantage it could have&quot; to defend its independence. Under Biden, Washington became the leader of the pro-Kyiv coalition, though the president has often been criticized for a supposedly self-restrictive and hesitant approach. The Biden administration has allocated over $170 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, providing more than $60 billion in military aid. Earlier this week, the U.S. announced a $500 million military assistance package for Ukraine and the largest yet package of sanctions against the Russian oil industry. When asked how long Ukraine can hold if Trump cuts aid, Biden voiced his conviction that as long as the European partners remain united, &quot;there is a real chance that the Ukrainians can prevail because the cost to Russia is incredibly high, over 600,000 dead or wounded.&quot; Biden added that Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;has his own problems economically... as well as politically at home.&quot; The Biden administration said it would seek to aid Ukraine as much as it can in its last months and weeks in office to put the country in the strongest possible negotiating position.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congress-should-ensure-that-ukraine-aid-continues-even-under-trump-biden-says/	2025-01-11T00:24:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193176681.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 12 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 12 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 11. Russia launched 74 Shahed-type attack drones and dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-seven drones were shot down over 11 oblasts, while 27 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, three people were injured in Russian attacks over the past day, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Two men aged 46 and 74 were injured during drone and artillery attacks against the Nikopol district on Jan. 10. Overnight, a 40-year-old man was injured in the same district, the governor said. A civilian was killed and another injured during a Russian attack against the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were injured as a result of Russian strikes, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twenty-one houses were damaged. One person was killed and six injured during Russian attacks on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. A 39-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman were hospitalized following a Russian attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia on the evening of Jan. 10. On the morning of the following day, a Russian drone hit a car in the village of Primorske, killing a &#xA0;47-year-old woman and injuring two men aged 46 and 60 and two women aged 49 and 52, Fedorov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-117/	2025-01-10T23:36:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_07-30-05.jpg

NATO won't endorse Trump's 5% spending target, but ready for increase, Reuters reports	NATO allies are unlikely to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s proposed spending target of 5% of GDP but are open to an increase from the current 2%, Reuters reported on Jan. 10, citing comments from officials and analysts from various NATO countries. On Jan. 7, Trump called for an increase to the NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, up from NATO&apos;s current target of 2%. Other NATO allies have urged increased spending in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;I think NATO should have 5%,&quot; Trump said at a news conference in Florida, confirming earlier reports about the incoming U.S. president urging allies to raise defense spending to a benchmark no NATO member has reached as of now, including the U.S. While many NATO members are not open to a 5% spending target, some many NATO allies are open to increasing the spending target to a widely agreed upon target. NATO members may agree to increase the spending target to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported. &quot;It seems there will be a shift... I don&apos;t think it will be 5%, which would be impossible for almost every nation in the world right now but... it will not be two (percent), which we are already struggling to reach, but it will be more than two,&quot; Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told Reuters. On Dec. 12 the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. According to sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by 2030. Trump has criticized NATO member states that do not meet the current 2% of GDP spending target. Several NATO allies, including Italy, Canada, and Spain do not meet the current target, though the number of allies that do rose to 24 last year. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). In the face of Russia&apos;s war, Ukraine has drastically increased defense spending, despite not being a part of NATO. Ukraine will spend 26% of its GDP on defense spending in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-wont-endorse-trumps-5-spending-target-but-ready-for-increase-reuters-reports/	2025-01-10T21:53:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026-1.jpg
Ukraine's inflation accelerated to 12% in 2024, exceeding government forecasts	Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% in 2024, exceeding forecasts made by the country&apos;s National Bank, Ukraine&apos;s statistics service Derzhstat announced on Jan. 10. The Ukrainian economy has undergone harsh conditions with the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Following the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues into its fourth year, inflation has continued to drive up prices for Ukrainians. The accelerated rate surpassed forecasts made by Ukraine&apos;s National Bank in November, which estimated that Ukraine would end 2024 at an annualized 9.7% inflation rate. The main driver for inflation growth in 2024 was the increasing cost of groceries as well as electricity costs. Food prices grew 1.8% in December, down from a yearly high of 3.9% in November, the Ukrainian state registry Derzhstat reported. The price of food and drinks increased 14.1% year over year from December 2023, with vegetables increasing 48.3% in price. Amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, electricity costs also increased by a massive 63.6% year over year in December, Derzhstat reported. Ukraine&apos;s National Bank predicted in November that the country&apos;s annual inflation rate will drop to 6.9% in 2025, and return to the bank&apos;s 5% target in 2026. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Since then, the country has made strides in stabilizing the situation, and the GDP is expected to grow by over 4% in 2024 and 2025. Despite the high inflation, Ukraine&apos;s economy has managed to adapt to the realities of the full-scale war as Russia&apos;s economy faces increasingly unfavorable forecasts. Russia faces surging inflation and a falling ruble that forced the central bank to institute a 21% interest rate, the highest level since the early 2000s. The Ukrainian government and economy have been propped up by financial support from Western allies, including military and humanitarian aid as well as loans from frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/inflation-reached-12-in-2024-exceeding-government-forecasts/	2025-01-10T21:16:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1859609907.jpg
Ukraine 'will do everything' it can to obtain security guarantees, end war in 2025, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said it is Ukraine&apos;s &quot;dream&quot; to end the war in 2025, as the country seeks to obtain security guarantees that would &quot;prevent Russia from returning with aggression,&quot; the president said in a television interview on Jan. 10. &quot;It&apos;s crucial for us that peace comes. We desire peace more than anyone else. And it&apos;s obvious, as we are the ones suffering the most, particularly in terms of lives lost,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with Italian broadcaster RaiNews24. &quot;It is our dream to obtain these (security) guarantees this year and to end the war this year. We will do everything to achieve this,&quot; Zelensky added. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is poised to take power on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy said on Jan. 8. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said during an interview on Fox News Kellogg did not discuss details of any potential peace agreements under consideration by the incoming administration. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Trump reportedly discussed with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron the prospects of European leadership in stopping the war during a visit to Paris in December. Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; Macron&apos;s proposal to deploy foreign peacekeepers on its territory but only after getting a clear understanding of the NATO membership timeline Before his visit to Italy, Zelensky attended the Ramstein summit in Germany on Jan. 9. At the meeting, several of Ukraine&apos;s allies pledged additional support. Ukrainian diplomats held bilateral meetings with key allies. Zelensky called for increased cooperation between Ukraine and its allies. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Jan. 9.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-will-do-anything-to-end-the-war-this-year-zelensky-says/	2025-01-10T19:25:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Pro-Russian Bulgarian politician demands return of 'historically Bulgarian' Southern Bessarabia region of Ukraine	Kostadin Kostadinov, leader of Bulgaria&#x2019;s pro-Russian Revival party, has fueled Kremlin narratives by claiming that Southern Bessarabia, part of Ukraine&#x2019;s Odesa Oblast, should be returned to Bulgaria. He stated on his Facebook page that he thinks &#x201C;Ukraine is falling apart&#x201D; and that Bulgarians are the &#x201C;indigenous population&#x201D; of the region, with deeper historical ties than Ukraine, which has controlled it for only 34 years. Kostadinov proposed presenting Bulgaria&#x2019;s claims to &#x201C;Bulgarian Bessarabia&#x201D; at a future peace congress to decide Ukraine&#x2019;s fate. He also called for unification with Macedonia, emphasizing shared history and culture, and compared his proposals to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s remarks about annexing Canada and regaining control of the Panama Canal. &#x201C;There is nothing more logical for two countries with a common history, common origin, common language and common people than to become one country,&#x201D; he wrote. The Ukrainian Embassy in Bulgaria condemned Kostadinov&#x2019;s statements, labeling them a distortion of historical facts that promote border redistribution and violate international law. The embassy urged official condemnation, highlighting the inappropriateness of such rhetoric from a politician in an EU member state. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but pro-Russian sentiment has remained strong in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-bulgarian-politician-demands-return-of-historically-bulgarian-southern-bessarabia-region-of-ukraine/	2025-01-10T16:14:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Ukraine and Russia not prepared for peace talks, White House says	U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that neither Russia nor Ukraine is currently prepared for negotiations to end the war, according to his comments at a briefing on Jan. 10. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested that initial talks on resolving the war might involve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before potentially engaging with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;This (the introduction of sanctions against the Russian Federation) was not done with the expectation that it would become a bargaining chip that could be taken off the table when Ukraine wants to sit down at this negotiating table. There is no expectation now that either side is ready for negotiations,&quot; Kirby said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry expects a Zelensky and Trump meeting soon after the upcoming inauguration. Also, Kirby stated that recent U.S. sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil sector were not introduced as leverage for future peace talks but were based on energy market forecasts. Kirby noted that earlier large-scale sanctions in this area were delayed to prevent domestic energy price hikes. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration plans to introduce a &quot;big package&quot; of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet and individuals, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Despite Western efforts to reduce Russia&#x2019;s income from oil funding its war against Ukraine, Moscow has been able to bypass sanctions and sell Russian oil above the imposed price cap of $60 per barrel with the buildup of a fleet of aging vessels with dubious ownership.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-russia-not-prepared-for-peace-talks-white-house-says/	2025-01-10T14:15:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2013302423.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian Neptune missile hits Russian drone warehouse in Rostov Oblast, SBU source claims	Key developments on Jan. 10: Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones using a domestically-made Neptune missile overnight on Jan. 10, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the attack near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast was carried out by the SBU and Ukraine&apos;s Navy. At first, Ukrainian drones reportedly &quot;overloaded&quot; Russian air defenses, with a Neptune missile hitting the site shortly after, the source said. Videos published on social media show the moment of an explosion in Rostov Oblast and a tall column of smoke rising over the settlement. The extent of the damage was not disclosed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Jan. 10. (Social media)Earlier on Jan. 10, local authorities and Russian independent media reported that Ukrainian drones had attacked several Russian oblasts overnight, causing severe fires in Leningrad and Rostov oblasts. Neptune is Ukraine&#x2019;s ground-launched, domestically produced anti-ship rocket with a maximum range of 300 kilometers. Ukrainian forces reportedly used Neptune missiles to destroy a Russian S-400 Triumph air defense system on Sept. 14 and sink Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea flagship Moskva in April 2022. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent. A day later, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported that the Armed Forces struck a plant in Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles. Ukrainian forces struck a Russian army command post in Svitlodarsk in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. In a post on Facebook, the military said the &quot;successful hit&quot; targeted Russia&apos;s 3rd Army Corps. Svitlodarsk is located around 30 kilometers southeast of Bakhmut, and was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted, but said &quot;all necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians.&quot; Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. &quot;This week in the Donetsk region the Armed Forces of Ukraine has conducted a series of strikes on facilities seized by Russian invaders,&quot; the General Staff added. This is the second such reported strike this week &#x2014; on Jan. 8 the General Staff said Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Similar attacks were also reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase. Ukrainian troops are holding defensive lines at the Kurakhove thermal power plant despite fierce fighting in the sector, Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 10. &quot;Now the Russians are trying to attack in the area of Dachne, and drive Ukrainian forces out of Kurakhove. Ukrainian forces are holding the thermal power plant and inflicting all the damage they can on the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in, a statement not confirmed at the time by Ukraine. On Jan. 7, a military spokesperson said Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove and the power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult.&quot; The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian troops are destroying large amounts of Russian military equipment in the Kurakhove sector, Trehubov added. Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled 29 Russian attacks in the Kurakhove sector near Sribne, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhove, and Dachne over the past day, the General Staff reported earlier in the day. Following the capture of Mariinka in early 2024, the Russian army intensified its advance toward Kurakhove. Street fighting is currently taking place in the town. Russian forces had earlier blown up the dam of the Kurakhove Reservoir, a hydraulic structure near the village of Stari Terny in the Kurakhove community. The thermal power plant in Kurakhove, for which the damaged reservoir was created, is not operating. The industrial facility has now become a fortification, and the scene of intense urban fighting in Kurakhove. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops are also focusing their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, acording to Spiegel. But Scholz claimed the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient, Spiegel reported. Scholz also expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Baerbock and Pistorius justified the need for the package by arguing that the combat situation in Ukraine was worsening, and that there was uncertainty about further U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s leadership. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine. The U.S. and the U.K. have enacted their most extensive sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, targeting nearly 200 vessels of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Jan. 10. &quot;The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia&apos;s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,&quot; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The sanctions include more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The measures also target two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry. In addition to sanctions, Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production with targeted drone strikes on infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10, citing sources familiar with the matter. This would mark Starmer&#x2019;s first visit to Ukraine since becoming prime minister. The trip comes as European nations ramp up discussions about regional security ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Paris and London are reportedly exploring the possibility of deploying French and British troops to monitor a potential ceasefire along the contact line in Ukraine. A senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in December that these discussions are happening bilaterally in national capitals rather than within NATO structures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly highlighted the potential peacekeeping mission on Jan. 9 following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron initially proposed deploying Western troops in February last year and revisited the idea in May, suggesting that France might consider sending forces if Russian troops broke through Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive lines. Donald Trump has also advocated for Europe to take the lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 that Trump emphasized Europe&#x2019;s greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Ukrainian officials maintain that NATO membership is essential for lasting peace. While full membership is unlikely amid the ongoing war, Kyiv has urged NATO allies to extend an invitation as a signal of support.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-neptune-missile-hits-russian-drone-warehouse-in-rostov-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-01-10T12:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-10-at-14_51_08.png
Ukrainian lawmakers move to dismiss Energy Minister, MP Zhelezniak reports	Members of the Verkhovna Rada Energy Committee led by MP Inna Sovsun, have initiated a resolution to dismiss Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak announced on Jan. 10. Zhelezniak cited several reasons for the motion, including &quot;systemic corruption in the energy sector,&quot; &quot;failure to protect parts of the energy infrastructure,&quot; and &quot;lies and manipulations.&quot; The MP also criticized Halushchenko&#x2019;s behavior during a parliamentary session earlier that day, calling it &quot;unacceptable.&quot; One of the key controversies involves the public disclosure of information on further completion of the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant&#x2019;s (NPP) power units. Sovsun highlighted a letter sent to the Energy Committee from representatives of the European Commission and the U.S. Embassy expressing concerns about this issue. During the session, Halushchenko faced backlash for dismissive remarks directed at the EU ambassador. Responding to Sovsun&apos;s concerns, he said: &quot;In fact, this is exactly the case, and if we are talking about the third and fourth [power units], it is in the text of the law that these units will operate on American fuel. As for the position of the middle-level clerks of the European Commission&apos;s representation, Inna, I am very sorry that you are running around embassies and pouring mud on our energy sector and our state.&quot; The Energy Ministry later clarified that Halushchenko&apos;s remarks did not reference the EU ambassador to Ukraine, as suggested during the session. Zhelezniak called on lawmakers to support the resolution for Halushchenko&#x2019;s dismissal, marking a potential shift in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy leadership. Halushchenko has served as Energy Minister since his appointment on Apr. 29, 2021.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-move-to-dismiss-energy-minister-mp-zhelezniak-reported/	2025-01-10T11:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/halus-1.jpg

As Russia cuts Transnistria from gas, stranded locals search for someone to blame	VARNI&#x21A;A, Moldova &#x2014; The buzzing sound of chainsaws and generators is now common in Varni&#x21B;a, a village of 5,000 that borders Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria. Located next to the Russian-controlled city of Bender (Tighina), the village is subordinated to Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u but depends on the neighbouring breakaway region for its energy infrastructure. Workers from TiraspolTransGaz, the company managing the gas supply in Transnistria, go door-to-door to make sure the gas taps are switched off. Gas storage in Russian-occupied region of Transnistria will last another 24 days after the halt of Russian supplies, local authorities said on Jan. 8. Many of the 360,000 people in Transnistria have already had their gas, electricity, and water cut since the start of the year, following the end of Russian gas shipments through Ukraine and Moscow&apos;s decline to use alternative routes to maintain the region&apos;s energy supply intact. &quot;This is a security rather than an energy crisis,&quot; says Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean, adding that Russia&apos;s aim is to influence the upcoming parliamentary elections set for the upcoming autumn. The self-proclaimed authorities of Russian-controlled Transnistria never paid Gazprom for the gas they used, while Moscow was continuing to bill Moldova for it. Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u declined to pay. Meanwhile, Transnistrian authorities used the gas to produce electricity in the Russian-owned Cuciurgan (Dnestrovsc) power station and sold the surplus to the unoccupied parts of the country cheaply. Following Russia&apos;s decision to cut the supplies, and not use the TurkStream pipeline to ship gas to Moldova bypassing Ukraine, Transnistria has been facing blackouts, while in the rest of the country its energy bills have doubled. Varni&#x21B;a, which is subordinated to the Moldovan capital Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u but is connected to the breakaway region&apos;s energy systems, had its gas switched off since New Year. Following the gas cut, people were forced to switch to electric heaters, while planned blackouts of up to nine hours per day were introduced by Tiraspol authorities. Zarina, at the shop where she works without electricity, in Varni&#x163;a, Moldova on Jan. 8, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent)Vadim Krasnoselsky, the self-proclaimed president of Transnistria, accused Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u of strangling the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also said Moldova and Ukraine were to blame for the energy crisis in Transnistria. The Moldovan authorities say Russia has created the crisis in the region. According to Moldova&apos;s contract with Gazprom, which expires in 2026, Russia is responsible for securing the transit. The main option would be the use of the TurkStream and Trans-Balkan pipelines, connecting Russia with Moldova via Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania. Moldovan authorities say they also offered TiraspolTransGaz help to buy gas on the international market, just like the rest of Moldova has been doing since 2021 when Russia reduced its gas supply to the country. The offer, however, was rejected by Tiraspol. In a press conference following a visit to Varni&#x21B;a on Jan. 9, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said the government will equip public institutions in the villages of Varni&#x21B;a and Copanca, as well the rest of the area &#xA0;under Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u control that may be affected by the energy crisis, with biomass power plants, wood and pellets. Sandu also mentioned her Jan. 8 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the two discussed Ukraine potentially selling coal to Transnistria to power the Cuciurgan plant. &quot;When we had a biomass heating system installed as part of a (European) project in our high school ten years ago, I thought it was a whim,&quot; Varni&#x21B;a Mayor Alexandr Nichitenco said. &quot;Now I can see it&apos;s useful; the children can go study unbothered,&quot; he said, adding that he has asked the government for more such projects. In the long run, Varni&#x21B;a will be able to connect to the Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u gas and electric systems, but according to the mayor, the switch may take around nine months. &quot;It will be a different winter,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone is guilty except for the people,&quot; says 32-year-old Zarina, a shop assistant who lives in breakaway Bender (Tighina) but commutes to neighboring government-controlled Varni&#x21B;a for work. The light is off in the cornershop she works in but clients come in unfazed to buy cakes and candies for the holiday season, ongoing until the old-style New Year or St Basil&apos;s Day celebrated on Jan. 14. &quot;For now, everything is ok,&quot; says Zarina, born during the 1992 war between Russia and Moldova, known as the Transnistria War. Her flat in Bender (Tighina) is still connected to gas, electricity, and water. &quot;But if worse comes to worst, we have grandparents living in the countryside with wood-burning stoves,&quot; she says. &quot;I have been through this before. I was there when the electricity was frequently cut in villages in the 1990s,&quot; she adds.

(The Kyiv Independent)A few streets away from the shop, retiree Ion B&#x103;ie&#x219;u puts wood in a bucket to take it to the stove he has built himself to heat up two of three rooms in his house. Normally, he and his wife Ecaterina used to rely on gas to warm up, since it was so cheap. But since the cut, they have switched to making a fire twice a day. &quot;(Russians) have kept us hostages for 30 years,&quot; says B&#x103;ie&#x219;u, who fought as a volunteer in the Russo-Moldovan war of 1992. &quot;When you ask people&apos; why do you vote for pro-Russian parties?&apos; they respond &#x2014; &apos;because of gas,&apos;&quot; says the 75-year-old. &quot;Don&apos;t you realize you&apos;re going to pay dearly for this at some point?&quot; he goes on. A few houses down the street, 49-year-old Oleg gathers his old wood fence panels in piles in the garden to have them ready to be used to warm up his home. He says he has enough wood for the next four months. Working in a chicken factory, he worries about the potential rise of gas prices, blaming President Sandu&apos;s pro-European stance for the ongoing Russian-coined energy crisis and the soaring bills. &quot;Russians want to give us gas, but Ukrainians don&apos;t want to transmit it,&quot; he says.

Tamara Cara, who together with her family runs a textile factory in Varni&#x21B;a, producing medical suits for export to Germany, has just bought generators &#x2014; two for the factory and one for her house. The 69-year-old employs 150 people, who mostly commute from Bender (Tighina). She says she hasn&apos;t been able to enjoy the festive season and instead &quot;was all nerves&quot; because of the blackouts caused by the gas cut. She blames the Russians for it but has no hope that the situation would get sorted any time soon. &quot;At least we don&apos;t have war,&quot; Cara says, remembering how she hid in the basement in 1992 when her husband was fighting on the front line.

(The Kyiv Independent)Prime Minister Recean has reiterated that the 2,000 illegally stationed Russian troops need to withdraw from Transnistria in order to let Chisinau manage its internationally recognized territory and solve the ongoing energy crisis caused by the occupying forces. Nicolae, a cultural worker from Russian-occupied Grigoriopol who preferred to have his name changed to avoid persecution, says people&apos;s views depend on what media they consume. &quot;Some blame Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u, others blame Zelensky. There are others still who put the blame on Moscow,&quot; Nicolae says. While he has satellite TV and follows the Moldovan public broadcaster and pro-European independent media, the majority have cable television, which runs three local Tiraspol-controlled channels, as well as Russian television, banned in the rest of Moldova since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russia-cuts-transnistria-from-gas-stranded-locals-look-who-to-blame/	2025-01-10T10:11:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Moldova_Varnita_0J6A0136.jpg
Breakthrough' — Poland, Ukraine reach agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations, PM Tusk says	A decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy, a contentious chapter in Polish-Ukrainian relations, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Jan. 10. &quot;Finally, a breakthrough. A decision has been made on the first exhumations of Polish victims of the UPA. I would like to thank the ministers of culture of Poland and Ukraine for their good cooperation. We are waiting for further decisions,&quot; Tusk wrote in a post on X. The Volyn massacre, which took place during World War II, involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. The decision followed a Jan. 9 meeting in Poland between Ukrainian National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov and Polish Culture Minister Anna Wroblewska. The discussions emphasized the role of culture in preserving national identity and fostering socio-economic development, the Polish Culture Ministry noted. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Tusk previously met in Lviv on Dec. 17 to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &quot;History certainly cannot divide us,&quot; he said on Dec. 17. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/breakthrough-poland-ukraine-reach-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations-pm-tusk-says/	2025-01-10T09:57:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167276071.jpg
Ukraine conducts 'precision strike' on Russian army command post in Donetsk Oblast, General Staff claims	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian army command post in Svitlodarsk in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. In a post on Facebook, the military said the &quot;successful hit&quot; targeted Russia&apos;s 3rd Army Corps. Svitlodarsk is located around 30 kilometers southeast of Bakhmut, and was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted, but said &quot;all necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians.&quot; Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. &quot;This week in the Donetsk region the Armed Forces of Ukraine has conducted a series of strikes on facilities seized by Russian invaders,&quot; the General Staff added. This is the second such reported strike this week &#x2014; on Jan. 8 the General Staff said Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Similar attacks were also reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2.Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-conducts-precision-strike-on-russian-army-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-10T08:58:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
US, UK impose sweeping sanctions on Russia’s oil sector, target shadow fleet	The U.S. and the U.K. have enacted their most extensive sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, targeting nearly 200 vessels of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Jan. 10. &quot;The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia&apos;s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,&quot; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The sanctions include more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The measures also target two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry. In addition to sanctions, Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production with targeted drone strikes on infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sweeping-sanctions-on-russias-oil-sector-targets-shadow-fleet/	2025-01-10T08:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg

Incoming Trump peace envoy postponed Ukraine visit over legal reasons, Kyiv confirms	The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg postponed his planned visit to Ukraine for legal reasons, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Jan. 10, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Tykhyi cited the U.S. Logan Act, which restricts unauthorized negotiations by private citizens with foreign governments, as the reason for the delay. Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kellogg was expected to visit Ukraine before the inauguration. Reuters then reported on Jan. 6 that the trip had been postponed but did not cite the reason behind the decision. &quot;I would prefer that General Kellogg&apos;s team comment on the timing of the visit. I can say that the visit is still being prepared; it will take place,&quot; Tykhyi said, emphasizing that the delay is not politically motivated. &quot;All contacts should take place after the president takes office. According to our information, this is the only reason,&quot; he said. The visit is now expected to occur after President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Kellogg, a former national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, is a known figure in Kyiv and &quot;has maintained close ties... in recent years,&quot; Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. The envoy is also scheduled to visit other European capitals, including Rome and Paris, as part of the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to address Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Trump has pledged to end the war quickly but has yet to provide specific details on his peace plan. Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution by 2025, expressing cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/incoming-trump-peace-envoy-postpones-ukraine-visit-over-legal-reasons-kyiv-confirms/	2025-01-10T07:35:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Japan's new sanctions are 'significant blow to Russia’s military-industrial complex,' Zelensky says	The Japanese government has broadened its sanctions list in response to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry announced on Jan. 10. The new measures targeted individuals and entities from Russia, China, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Turkey, and North Korea. Twenty-nine Russian entities, including the Machine-Building Scientific and Production Union and Aleksinsky Chemical Plant, three banks, and 11 individuals, are among those affected. Export restrictions were imposed on 22 additional Russian companies and 335 commodity names. &quot;It is a significant blow to Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex, limiting access to critical microelectronics and creating additional obstacles for the production of missiles and drones,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in response to the move. Additionally, sanctions have been imposed on 31 foreign companies from China, the UAE, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Turkey, and Georgia, as well as Georgian MRB Bank, and one North Korean citizen. Japan lifted sanctions against eight individuals, including Violetta Prigozhina, the mother of Wagner Group then-leader leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash on Aug. 23. While refraining from providing lethal military aid, Japan has consistently supported Ukraine in its struggle against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. On Jun. 21, Tokyo, for the first time, announced sanctions against China-based companies over their support for Russian aggression. Japan has also previously joined the international sanctions regime against Russia and other steps taken against Moscow within the Group of Seven (G7).	https://kyivindependent.com/japan-sanctions-russias-defense-firms-entities-foreign-ministry-reported/	2025-01-10T07:13:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2076165812.jpg
Ukrainian forces defending Kurakhove thermal power plant amid intense fighting in Donetsk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops are holding defensive lines at the Kurakhove thermal power plant despite fierce fighting in the sector, Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 10. &quot;Now the Russians are trying to attack in the area of Dachne, and drive Ukrainian forces out of Kurakhove. Ukrainian forces are holding the thermal power plant and inflicting all the damage they can on the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in, a statement not confirmed at the time by Ukraine. On Jan. 7, a military spokesperson said Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove and the power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult.&quot; The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian troops are destroying large amounts of Russian military equipment in the Kurakhove sector, Trehubov added. Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled 29 Russian attacks in the Kurakhove sector near Sribne, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhove, and Dachne over the past day, the General Staff reported earlier in the day. Following the capture of Mariinka in early 2024, the Russian army intensified its advance toward Kurakhove. Street fighting is currently taking place in the town. Russian forces had earlier blown up the dam of the Kurakhove Reservoir, a hydraulic structure near the village of Stari Terny in the Kurakhove community. The thermal power plant in Kurakhove, for which the damaged reservoir was created, is not operating. The industrial facility has now become a fortification, and the scene of intense urban fighting in Kurakhove. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops are also focusing their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-defend-kurakhove-thermal-power-plant-amid-intense-fighting-military-says/	2025-01-10T06:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142645.jpg
Scholz blocks proposal for $3 billion arms package for Ukraine, Spiegel reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, acording to Spiegel. But Scholz claimed the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient, Spiegel reported. Scholz also expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Baerbock and Pistorius justified the need for the package by arguing that the combat situation in Ukraine was worsening, and that there was uncertainty about further U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s leadership. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-blocks-proposal-for-additional-3-billion-worth-arms-package-for-ukraine-spiegel-reports/	2025-01-10T05:50:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Ukrainian Neptune missile hits Russian drone warehouse in Rostov Oblast, SBU source claims	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones using a domestically-made Neptune missile overnight on Jan. 10, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the attack near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast was carried out by the SBU and Ukraine&apos;s Navy. &#xA0; At first, Ukrainian drones reportedly &quot;overloaded&quot; Russian air defenses, with a Neptune missile hitting the site shortly after, the source said. The extent of the damage was not disclosed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-neptune-missile-hits-russian-drone-warehouse-in-rostov-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-01-10T04:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-10-142355.png
EU provides Ukraine with $3 billion, first tranche of loans from bloc backed by Russian frozen assets	Ukraine has received 3 billion euros ($3 .09 billion) from the EU, the first tranche of loans from the bloc funded by proceeds of frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 10. The money has been provided through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, in which G7 countries pledged to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan, with the EU contributing about $20 billion. &quot;This is the first tranche of funds from the European Union, secured through income from frozen Russian assets,&quot; Shmyhal said in a post on Telegram. &quot;In this way, we are implementing the principle of &apos;Russia will pay&apos; and strengthening Ukraine&apos;s financial stability in 2025,&quot; he added. The U.S. Treasury Department announced in December that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to the initiative. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a mechanism to fully confiscate the frozen Russian funds, highlighting their potential to bolster Ukraine&apos;s long-term recovery. According to October reports, the G7 plans to keep these Russian assets immobilized even after the war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-provides-ukraine-with-nearly-3-billion-in-loans-backed-by-russian-frozen-assets/	2025-01-10T03:59:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Russian elite 'disappointed' about Putin's handling of war in Ukraine, Meduza reports	Members of Russia&apos;s political elite are &quot;disappointed&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s handling of the war in Ukraine, and had hoped it would end in 2024, Meduza reported on Jan. 9. Citing ten officials including two sources close to Putin&#x2019;s administration, and one senator, the independent Russian media outlet said the state of the country&apos;s economy was a particular &quot;point of tension.&quot; &quot;The main emotion is disappointment,&quot; a source in the Russian government told Meduza, adding: &#xA0;&quot;We expected the war to end, for the fighting to end. Fatigue has been the main feeling for a long time.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;re already tired of waiting, even. It feels like you&#x2019;re going deeper and deeper every day. We also expected some kind of lifting of sanctions in exchange for peace. Now, they&#x2019;re inflicting more and more pain,&quot; the source added. Russia recently suffered one of its &quot;most costly defeats,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Jan 8, in reference to the shutdown of Russia&apos;s gas transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv had repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. Sources cited by Meduza also said the prospects for peace had diminished after Ukraine launched its Kursk incursion in August 2024, though they added the war may have dragged on into 2025 regardless. &quot;The president likes to fight, it&#x2019;s exciting for him. Why stop halfway if you can put the final squeeze on them?&quot; one said. But the source added that there was also frustration among high-ranking security officials that Putin had not taken steps to put Russia on a full war footing, such as launching another round of mobilization. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its third anniversary, both sides face increasing economic and demographic pressures caused by the war. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-elite-disappointed-about-putins-handling-of-war-in-ukraine-meduza-reports/	2025-01-10T03:33:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192275787.jpg
Kremlin 'welcomes' Trump's 'readiness' for talks on Russia's war in Ukraine	The Kremlin on Jan. 10 said it &quot;welcomed&quot; President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;readiness&quot; for talks, but added plans for any face-to-face meeting would not be drawn up until after his inauguration later this month. Trump said on Jan. 9 that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to meet with him, and that preparations for a meeting are underway. &quot;He wants to meet, and we are setting it up,&quot; Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, adding: &quot;President Putin wants to meet. He has said that even publicly and we have to get that war over with. That&apos;s a bloody mess.&quot; Speaking to Russian media on Jan. 10, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said &quot;no conditions are required&quot; for such a meeting. &quot;(Only) a mutual desire and political will to conduct a dialogue and resolve existing problems through dialogue is required,&quot; he said. &quot;We see that Mr. Trump also declares his readiness to resolve problems through dialogue, we welcome this,&quot; he added. But Peskov added there were not currently any concrete plans for a meeting. Trump is to take office on Jan. 20. During his presidential campaign, Trump claimed that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine quickly, in part because of his allegedly good relationship with Putin. Putin, on Dec. 19, said that he was prepared to meet with Trump at &quot;any time&quot; to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Since then, Russian officials have dismissed reported peace deals from Trump&apos;s team, saying they do not meet Putin&apos;s terms. Trump&apos;s push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. About 20% of Ukrainian territory is currently under occupation by Russian forces. Trump&apos;s nominee for special Ukraine peace envoy, retired general Keith Kellogg, has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage in dialogue with the Russian president, and criticized U.S. President Joe Biden for refusing to do so. Kellogg said on Jan. 8 that the administration aims to end the war in 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/preparations-for-trump-putin-meeting-wont-begin-until-presidents-inauguration-in-us-kremlin-says/	2025-01-10T02:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1244638462.jpg
Citing Russia's war in Ukraine, Norway plans to resume construction of civilian bomb shelters	The Norwegian government plans to resume construction of bomb shelters, citing Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as evidence they are needed in case of a &quot;worst-case scenario,&quot; NRK reported on Jan. 10. &quot;There is more uncertainty around us,&quot; Norwegian Justice and Public Security Minister Emilie Mehl told the outlet, adding: &quot;We must take care of the civilian population in the event of a &apos;worst-case scenario&apos; of war or armed attack. Shelters are one of the protective measures we need.&quot; Up until 1998, any new large apartment buildings constructed in Norway were required to incorporate a bomb shelter into their design. No new shelters have been built since, NRK reports. &quot;We are now actually setting a requirement that buildings over 1,000 square meters must have shelters,&quot; Mehl said. The Norwegian government is proposing two types of shelters &#x2014; new shelters will meet the requirements of modern designs which protect against chemical, radioactive, as well as high explosives. The second type of shelter will be adapted from existing structures to protect against conventional weapons. &quot;These can be garages, subway tunnels, or other underground structures that also have an important and distinctive function in our daily lives,&quot; Mehl said. Bomb shelters have become part of the daily routine for most Ukrainiains, who seek refuge in basements, metro stations, and other structures like underground car parks during Russian bombardments. &quot;We have learned a lot about modern warfare, and we also see that shelters and refuges are essential to protecting civilians. We also must have this in Norway, and it has to be part of the country&apos;s preparedness for the future,&quot; Mehl said. Norway is ranked 12th in the world regarding the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.8 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker. Oslo may increase its support for Ukraine to 30 billion kroner ($2.7 billion) in 2025, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Nov. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-in-ukraine-prompts-norway-to-build-new-bomb-shelters/	2025-01-10T02:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1937598237-1.jpg

Ukrainian drones reportedly attack Russia's Leningrad, Rostov oblasts, causing severe fires	Ukrainian drones attacked several Russian oblasts overnight on Jan. 10, causing severe fires in Leningrad and Rostov oblasts, local authorities and Russian independent media reported. Russian air defense forces reportedly intercepted 40 Ukrainian drones throughout the night, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed. According to the ministry, Russian forces destroyed 16 drones over Rostov Oblast, four over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts, three over Bryansk Oblast, two over the Kuban region, one over Belgorod Oblast, and 10 over the Azov Sea. The drone attack reportedly caused a large-scale fire in the town of Gatchina in Leningrad Oblast. The fire started in an industrial zone, the independent news channel Astra reported, citing locals. Ingria Tech, a company that sells panel coatings and paints, is located near the fire site, as well as a food processing facility, and a building materials plant, according to Astra. The Russian state news agency TASS also claimed an acetone plant was on fire. The fire covered an area of 1,900 square meters, Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry said. No one was injured, the ministry added. Another fire caused by a drone attack occurred in Rostov Oblast. Near the city of Rostov, a fire broke out in an industrial production facility covering 2,000 square meters, the Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. According to Astra, one of the attacks struck the village of Chaltyr, landing near a hospital. Rostov Oblast Governor Vasily Golubev also reported a fire in a house in Chaltyr.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-russias-leningrad-rostov-oblasts-causing-severe-fires/	2025-01-09T23:29:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-10-09_10_07.jpeg
EU issues new alert for planes flying in Russian airspace	The EU&apos;s aviation safety watchdog on Jan. 9 issued a new alert advising non-European airlines to avoid flying over western Russia following the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane last month. The crash, which killed 38 people, is believed to have been caused by Russian air defenses firing at Ukrainian drones. &quot;The ongoing conflict following the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses the risk of civil aircraft being unintentionally targeted in the airspace of the Russian Federation due to possible civil-military coordination deficiencies, and the potential for misidentification,&quot; the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said. &quot;EASA recommends not to operate within the affected airspace of the Russian Federation located west of longitude 60&#xB0; East at all altitudes and flight levels.&quot; Russian airspace is already closed to EU airlines. The alert applies to third-country operators authorised by EASA. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane, en route from Baku to Grozny, Chechnya, changed course and crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. Multiple reports and official Azerbaijani statements attributed the disaster to a missile launched by a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has maintained close ties with Azerbaijan, offered condolences during a Dec. 28 phone call but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. Aliyev also blamed Russia for failing to close its airspace near Grozny and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-issues-new-alert-for-planes-flying-in-russian-airspace/	2025-01-09T22:51:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903922-1.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 804,930 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 804,930 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. This number includes 1,830 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,741 tanks, 20,253 armored fighting vehicles, 33,473 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,789 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,041 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,884 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-804-930-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-09T22:15:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2153003239.jpg
Lukashenko refuses to invite OSCE observers to upcoming election	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has refused to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s upcoming presidential election, the OSCE said in a statement issued Jan. 9. Lukashenko has been in power for 30 years and is seeking a seventh term on Jan. 26. The regime&apos;s election rigging in 2020 &#x2014;&#xA0;the last time Belarus held a presidential vote &#x2014; sparked mass protests and a subsequent violent crackdown. The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) said Minsk&apos;s decision not to invite observers was &quot;deeply regrettable&quot; and a violation of the country&apos;s international obligations. &quot;I deeply regret the decision of the Belarusian authorities not to invite OSCE states through ODIHR to observe the forthcoming presidential election, depriving the country&apos;s citizens of a transparent and full assessment of the entire process,&quot; ODIHR Director Maria Telalian said. &quot;This decision underscores the continued lack of commitment by the Belarusian authorities to invite other OSCE states to observe and provide an independent view on whether the elections are held in line with OSCE commitments and international democratic standards.&quot; ODIHR said it had reached out to Belarusian officials over the past few months in efforts to secure an invitation to observe the elections, but received no offer. OSCE monitors were also unable to observe the August 2020 election due to lack of a timely invitation, the organization said. According to OSCE, the office is still monitoring events in Belarus, despite its inability to observe the Jan. 26 vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-refuses-to-invite-osce-observers-to-upcoming-election/	2025-01-09T21:53:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147741177.jpg
Kyiv calls Polish presidential candidate 'manipulative' for comments on Ukraine's EU, NATO accession	Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki&apos;s recent comments on Ukraine were &quot;manipulative,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Jan. 9. The statement comes after Nawrocki said in a television interview on Jan. 8 that he does not currently see Ukraine becoming a member of the European Union or NATO. &quot;Today, I do not see Ukraine in any structure &#x2014; neither in the European Union nor in NATO &#x2014; until important... issues for Poles are resolved,&quot; Nawrocki said in an interview with Polsat News. &quot;A country that cannot answer for a very brutal crime against 120,000 of its neighbors cannot be part of international alliances.&quot; Nawrocki&apos;s remarks refer to the 1943 Volyn massacre, during which tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Ukraine and thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. The legacy of the massacre remains an ongoing source of modern-day tensions between Poland and Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry denounced Nawrocki&apos;s comments as &quot;biased and manipulative.&quot; &quot;Such statements indicate that the Polish politician prioritizes short-term political considerations over the strategic security interests of his own country, the good-neighbourly relations between Ukraine and Poland, and the shared values of freedom, democracy, and justice.&quot; Poland will hold presidential elections on May 18. Nawrocki is campaigning with the opposition Law and Justice Party (PiS), a right-wing political faction. Nawrocki, currently the head of the Polish National Remembrance Institute, criticized a joint statement on the exhumation of Volyn massacre victims in Ukraine between Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski. &#xA0; The agreement was an &quot;unnecessary outburst by the head of Polish diplomacy,&quot; Nawrocki said, accusing the Sikorski of leveraging the agreement to launch his own presidential campaign. &#xA0; In its response, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry emphasized the ongoing &quot;constructive dialogue&quot; between Kyiv and Warsaw. &#xA0; t	https://kyivindependent.com/today-i-dont-see-ukraine-in-the-eu-or-nato-polish-presidential-candidate-says/	2025-01-09T21:37:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161798255.jpg
Norway allocates over $2 billion in military aid for Ukraine in 2025, Umerov says	Norway has allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said following a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Jan. 9. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. Previously, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere on Dec. 16 announced 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea. Umerov met with Norwegian Defense Minister Bjorn Arild Gram on the sidelines of the Ramstein summit in Germany on Jan. 9. According to Umerov, the 2025 assistance to Ukraine will mark the largest military aid package in Norway&apos;s history. The two ministers discussed how to prioritize Norway&apos;s assistance. &quot;Special attention was given to the strengthening of air defense &#x2014; a critical area where we count on Norway&apos;s support,&quot; Umerov said in a social media post following the summit. Norway will continue investing in Ukraine&apos;s domestic military production and joint projects, particularly ammunition production, he added. Norway has pledged a new funding mechanism for Ukraine, the &quot;Norwegian model,&quot; meant to complement an existing &quot;Danish model&quot; of defense spending. The Danish model aims to purchase arms from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than providing materiel shipments. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Ukraine&apos;s other allies also reaffirmed their support at the Ramstein summit, the last such meeting under U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-allocates-over-2-billion-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-in-2025-umerov-says/	2025-01-09T19:38:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/umerov.jpeg
Trump says Putin wants to meet, arrangements already underway	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 9 that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to meet with him, and that preparations for the meeting are underway. &quot;He wants to meet, and we are setting it up,&quot; Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. &quot;President Putin wants to meet. He has said that even publicly and we have to get that war over with. That&apos;s a bloody mess.&quot; Trump did not provide any further details on the upcoming meeting. The claim comes days before Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine, often referring to his good relationship with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-putin-wants-to-meet-arrangements-already-underway/	2025-01-09T18:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Moscow closely monitoring Trump's Greenland ambitions, Kremlin claims	Russia is closely watching U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s statements about a possible military takeover of Greenland, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Jan. 9. Peskov&apos;s comments come after Trump on Jan. 7 refused to rule out the possibility of using military force to seize control of Greenland, which he said the U.S. needs for &quot;economic security.&quot; Russia is monitoring the situation due to its &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region, Peskov said. &quot;The Arctic is a zone of our national interests, our strategic interests,&quot; Peskov said. &quot;We are interested in preserving the atmosphere of peace and stability in the Arctic zone. We are watching the rather dramatic development of the situation very closely, but so far, thank God, at the level of statements.&quot; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded to Trump&apos;s comments by saying Greenland is &quot;not for sale&quot; and that its future belongs to the people of Greenland. Other European officials, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and E.U. chief diplomat Kaja Kallas, also made statements defending the territorial integrity of Greenland. Peskov criticized the response of E.U. leaders as overly timid. &quot;Europe reacts very timidly and it is of course scary to react to Trump&apos;s words, therefore Europe reacts very cautiously, modestly, quietly, almost in a whisper,&quot; Peskov said. Russia&apos;s growing ambitions and military presence in the Arctic have prompted other nations, notably Canada and the U.S., to revise their security strategies in the region. Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, has touted an expansionist agenda that includes taking over Greenland, seizing the Panama Canal, and annexing Canada. In the same Jan. 7 press conference, he blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and Kyiv&apos;s NATO aspirations for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-closely-monitoring-trumps-greenland-ambitions-kremlin-claims/	2025-01-09T18:31:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192273983.jpg
Russia's deployment of North Korean troops in Ukraine signals Putin's desperation, Austin says	Russia has endured over 700,000 casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022&#x2014;more than in all of Moscow&#x2019;s conflicts since World War II combined, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Jan. 9. The toll, which surpasses two-thirds of the Russian military&apos;s pre-war strength, reflects the severe cost of what Vladimir Putin calls &quot;special military operation,&quot; Austin said at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. In November 2024 alone, Russia lost nearly 1,500 troops daily, a pace that has stretched its military resources to the breaking point. &quot;Volunteers cannot make up for these stunning losses,&quot; Austin added. &quot;The Kremlin has been reduced to scouring Russia&#x2019;s jails and coercing contract soldiers.&quot; In a desperate bid to sustain its offensive, &quot;Moscow has even rushed troops from North Korea into a war that they don&#x2019;t belong in,&quot; Austin noted, calling it a clear sign of Putin&#x2019;s growing desperation. Since joining the war in December, over 1,000 North Korean soldiers have reportedly died, according to Austin. President Volodymyr Zelensky placed the figure at 4,000 North Korean troops which included both wounded and killed. U.S. defense secretary also highlighted the economic impact of the war which has been equally devastating for ordinary Russians. With the Kremlin allocating 40 percent of its 2025 budget to sustain the war effort&#x2014;a 25 percent increase from the previous year&#x2014;the ruble has continued its downward spiral, according to Austin. The Kremlin&#x2019;s increasing reliance on authoritarian allies like North Korea has further isolated Moscow on the world stage. &quot;Russia&#x2019;s global stature and strategic position have continued to decay.&quot; Despite the heavy cost, Putin has little to show for his efforts. &quot;Russia has paid an appalling price for this indefensible war,&quot; Austin concluded. &quot;Yet Putin has not achieved a single one of his strategic objectives. Not one.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-deployment-of-north-korean-troops-in-ukraine-signals-putins-desperation-austin-says/	2025-01-09T16:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Canada to allocate $305 million in military assistance to Ukraine	Canada has pledged $305 million (CAD $440 million) in additional military assistance to Ukraine, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair announced at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Jan. 9. The announcement includes $138 million (CAD $200 million) allocated to Czechia&#x2019;s initiative for procuring and delivering large-calibre ammunition to Ukraine, adding to over $36 million (CAD $53 million) pledged last year. This funding has already resulted in the delivery of approximately 11,500 rounds of large-calibre ammunition. Another $35 million (CAD $50 million) will be dedicated to procuring various calibres of ammunition from Canadian manufacturers. &quot;The military assistance announced today provides Ukrainians with resources needed to resist Russian aggression,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The (contact group), through the leadership of Secretary Austin, has been vital in ensuring that the military aid we&#x2019;re collectively providing Ukraine is comprehensive, well-coordinated, and meets the country&#x2019;s most pressing needs. Canada remains strongly committed to working with our Allies and partners to support Ukraine until victory.&quot; Blair also committed $70 million (CAD $100 million) to the Danish Model, which supports Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic production of military drones. Drones have played a crucial role in the war, with Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry advancing rapidly in this area. This funding builds on Canada&#x2019;s earlier contributions, including $2 million (CAD $3 million) provided in April 2024 and the donation of 900 Canadian-built SkyRanger drones, of which 560 have already reached Ukraine. Since February 2022, Canada has provided $3.1 billion (CAD $4.5 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine. This support has included advanced weaponry, drones, and vehicles. Minister Blair added that deliveries of approximately 1,300 CRV-7 rocket warheads were completed in December 2024, following the shipment of over 2,000 rocket motors earlier in the year. The first batch of Armoured Combat Support Vehicles arrived in the fall, with training completed, and an additional 40 vehicles are set for delivery by the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-to-allocate-305-million-in-military-assistance-to-ukraine/	2025-01-09T14:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/bill-blair.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's 47th Brigade releases video of 'massive' Russian attack repelled in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 9: Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade said on Jan. 9 that it had, together with other units, repelled a &quot;massive&quot; Russian assault in the embattled Kursk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 50 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. The Russian attack reportedly involved about 50 vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and buggies. According to the brigade, Russian troops initially tried to demine the approaches to Ukrainian positions and attacked in six waves. Russia deployed &quot;a huge number of soldiers,&quot; with Ukrainian forces killing 45 troops and injuring 53, the military claimed. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Jan. 9, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade/Telegram)&quot;Tanks, BMP-2, BMD, APCs (armored personnel carriers), buggies and Lancets &#x2014; our soldiers and comrades burned Russian equipment worth tens of millions of dollars,&quot; the brigade said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. No further details on the attack were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Interfax Ukraine reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. The claim comes as North Korea has deepened its military ties with Moscow. Dorothy Camille Shea, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., said on Jan. 8 that more than 12,000 North Korean troops were in Russia. &quot;Putin is not just maintaining his investment in aggression. He&apos;s doubling down. He&apos;s even started hiring soldiers from North Korea to keep this war going,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;North Korea is learning modern methods of warfare. They do not value their people. They have lost 4,000 people so far.&quot; North Korea&apos;s involvement is seen as mutually beneficial for Pyongyang and Moscow. Shea warned that North Korea is gaining &quot;valuable combat experience&quot; and receiving Russian military equipment and technology, which could enhance its capacity to wage war. Pyongyang reportedly deployed its troops to Kursk Oblast last fall to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued to fight in the region, seeking to retain it as leverage for future negotiations with Russia. In his Jan. 5 interview with Lex Fridman, Zelensky also warned that Pyongyang could send an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Ramstein airbase in Germany on Jan. 9, delivering an opening address to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting. Zelensky is expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings during the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. Around $3.8 billion remains allocated under the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), leaving it uncertain whether Trump will continue using this tool to funnel arms to Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; the president noted. The UDCG comprises 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, and was formed in April 2022 to coordinate international support for Ukraine. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz implied earlier this week that the Jan. 9 meeting might be the last one in the current format. Zelensky highlighted bilateral security agreements Ukraine has concluded with individual countries and called on allies to invest in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, namely in developing drone capabilities. Ukraine&apos;s head of state further pointed to Russian hybrid operations targeting NATO countries, mentioning recent reports of damaged undersea cables or &quot;destabilization efforts in Africa.&quot; &quot;We are also learning more about how Russian intelligence paid militants in Afghanistan to target coalition soldiers when your troops were present there... American soldiers, NATO country soldiers. How can this be forgiven or forgotten?&quot; Zelensky asked. The Insider recently published an investigation into Russian military intelligence (GRU) allegedly paying off terrorist groups in Afghanistan to attack coalition soldiers. Trump, who was president when the U.S. intelligence pointing to Russian-sponsored killings surfaced in 2020, was at the time criticized for inaction and for doubting the reports. Ukraine is negotiating with the U.S. to obtain licenses to manufacture air defense systems and missiles on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9. Zelensky made this statement at the opening of the 25th Ramstein summit, which was dedicated to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defenses, particularly its air defense. This summit will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. about licensing air defense systems and missile production here in Ukraine. And this could become a significant part of our security guarantees. And it is absolutely possible to do it,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky mentioned the Russian Jan. 8 attack on Zaporizhzhia, which killed 13 people and injured more than 100, and called for additional air defense systems for Ukraine. &quot;This is just one day, just one attack, just one air strike. We need to stop the Russian terror. And you can do it. We ask for immediate delivery of air defense systems,&quot; the president said. In December 2024, Zelensky said he had repeatedly asked the U.S. to provide licenses to produce Patriot systems in Ukraine but had not received permission. &quot;I have asked the U.S. many times to grant licenses for the production of the Patriot (air defense system). No one seemed to mind. No one has ever told me: &apos;No, we won&apos;t give you one.&apos; But so far, we have not received anything,&quot; Zelensky told Le Parisien on Dec. 18. The president added that in the three years of war, Ukraine has not yet received the number of air defense systems it needs to defend itself against Russia. Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Jan. 9 a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. The package was unveiled at the Ramstein summit in Germany. It is expected to be the final U.S. defense tranche provided by the Biden administration before Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The incoming U.S. leadership changes have also cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), a coalition of 57 countries that has been coordinating aid for Ukraine since April 2022. &quot;Month after month, members of this Contact Group have helped provide, produce, and sustain the systems and the munitions that Ukraine needs,&quot; Austin said in his address to the meeting alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. &quot;So we must not let up. That&apos;s why I am announcing today another presidential drawdown authority package valued at approximately $500 million. &quot;It includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more ammunition, and more air-to-ground munitions and other equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s F-16s.&quot; Around $3.8 billion remains allocated for Ukraine under the presidential drawdown authority, which enables Washington to provide arms and equipment to Kyiv directly from the Pentagon&apos;s stocks. The future of these funds under the incoming Trump administration is uncertain. Austin, who is attending the summit for the last time as defense secretary, highlighted the Ramstein group&apos;s progress over its more than two-and-a-half years of existence, including the formation of eight &quot;capability coalitions&quot; led by 14 countries and Ukraine. &quot;Earlier today, the Coalition Leadership Group met again... And they endorsed Capability Coalition roadmaps leading to the year 2027,&quot; Austin said. According to the outgoing defense secretary, the UDCG countries have committed more than $122 billion worth of assistance throughout the full-scale war. &quot;Here is the fundamental truth: Ukraine&apos;s fight matters to all of us. As I said here in Ramstein back at our first meeting in April 2022, Putin&apos;s war &apos;is a challenge to free people everywhere.&apos;&quot; Ukraine is prepared to provide jobs at defense enterprises for citizens abroad and exempt them from the mobilization of conscripts, National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on Jan. 8, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;We have a shortage of professionals, and Ukraine is ready to exempt most of them from military service,&quot; Chernyshov said. To address this need, the Ukrainian government plans to establish centers to assist citizens abroad in finding jobs in both Ukraine and their current countries of residence, he added. These centers aim to guide individuals toward career paths that can benefit Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Chernyshov expressed confidence that many Ukrainians would take advantage of these opportunities. Neighboring countries, including Poland and Lithuania, have suggested they may assist Ukraine in facilitating the return of fighting-aged men, though no concrete measures have been announced. Meanwhile, nations like Germany and Estonia have extended temporary residency permits for Ukrainian refugees, even in cases where passports have expired. Ukraine lowered its mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but has resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. These new initiatives reflect the government&apos;s efforts to balance workforce needs in critical sectors with national defense requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-47th-brigade-releases-video-of-massive-russian-attack-repelled-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-09T13:54:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-09-142759.png
Trump revises Ukraine peace timeline, FT reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has revised his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine within &quot;24 hours,&quot; now suggesting a timeline of several months. European officials view this adjustment as an indication that his administration will not immediately withdraw support for Kyiv. Two European officials told the Financial Times that recent discussions with Trump&#x2019;s incoming team revealed no concrete plan to resolve the war yet. They also emphasized that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would persist following Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. &quot;The whole [Trump] team is obsessed with strength and looking strong, so they&#x2019;re recalibrating the Ukraine approach,&quot; one official said. The official added that Trump&#x2019;s camp is cautious about avoiding comparisons with Joe Biden&#x2019;s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they do not want to see replicated in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Trump said a six-month timeline was more realistic for ending the war. Meanwhile, his designated envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, set a goal of resolving the war within 100 days. &quot;I would like to set a goal on a personal and professional level &#x2014; I would set it at 100 days and move all the way back,&quot; Kellogg told Fox News. &quot;And figure a way we can do this in the near term, to make sure the solution is solid and it&#x2019;s sustainable and that this war ends so that we stop the carnage.&quot; European leaders are urging Trump and his team to maintain U.S. military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it is critical for Kyiv&#x2019;s defense and for compelling Moscow to engage in peace talks. French officials noted last month that halting Russia&#x2019;s advances in eastern Ukraine is essential to any negotiation, as discussions are unlikely while Moscow continues to gain territory. Washington&#x2019;s military support remains a cornerstone of Ukraine&apos;s defense, complemented by European contributions of weapons and financial aid. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, dismissed concerns that the U.S. might abandon Ukraine. Meloni stressed that Ukraine must receive concrete security guarantees as part of any diplomatic resolution to the war. &quot;Security guarantees are fundamental if we actually aspire to have peace in Ukraine,&quot; she reportedly said. &quot;We all know that in the past Russia has violated the agreements that it has signed. Without security guarantees, we cannot have certainty that will not happen again.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to advocate for a firm timeline for Ukraine to join NATO as part of these guarantees. However, both Trump and outgoing President Joe Biden have expressed reservations about such a commitment, and some European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, share their hesitancy. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed deploying European troops to Ukraine to prevent future Russian aggression, though this idea lacks consensus among European nations. The Kremlin said earlier that President Vladimir Putin is open to dialogue with Trump and would welcome his approach. Putin&#x2019;s main objectives in any talks include ensuring Ukraine never joins NATO and negotiating a reduction of NATO&#x2019;s military presence in Eastern Europe. &quot;He wants to change the rules of the international order so there are no threats to Russia,&quot; a former senior Kremlin official said. &quot;Trump wants to roll back NATO anyway. The world is changing; anything can happen.&quot; NATO leaders, including Secretary-General Mark Rutte, have urged Trump to prioritize &quot;peace through strength&quot; in Ukraine, warning that a settlement unfavorable to Kyiv could embolden adversaries like Putin, China&#x2019;s Xi Jinping, North Korea&#x2019;s Kim Jong Un, and Iran.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-revises-ukraine-peace-timeline-ft-reports/	2025-01-09T13:32:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026.jpg
Syria reportedly blocks evacuation of Russian military equipment from naval base	The new Syrian authorities have refused to grant entry to a ship that was supposed to evacuate Russian military equipment from Russia&apos;s Tartus naval base in Syria, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 9. The refusal follows the December overthrow of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces, marking a significant shift in Syria&#x2019;s political landscape. The Sparta II, a Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions, has been drifting near Tartus since Jan. 5 after leaving Baltiysk in Kaliningrad Oblast on Dec. 11, according to the Moscow Times. Reports indicate that Russian forces have dismantled air defense radars and moved over 100 trucks of equipment to the port. No ships are currently docked to facilitate the evacuation, leaving personnel and equipment stranded. Without clearance from the new Syrian government, the evacuation of Russia&apos;s military assets from Tartus has stalled, according to Maritime Executive. The Khmeimim Air Base, serviced by Russian Defense Ministry flights, reportedly remains the only active evacuation route. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha addressed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. According to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Ukraine and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the matter, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-evacuation-efforts-stalled-as-new-syrian-leaders-deny-port-access-media-reports/	2025-01-09T13:16:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
EU ready to lead in Ukraine support if US steps back, chief diplomat says	The European Union is prepared to take a leading role in supporting Ukraine if U.S. backing wanes, EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas said on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, German media outlet Tagesschau reported. &quot;If the United States is not ready for it, the European Union is ready to take the lead,&quot; Kallas said. President-elect Donald Trump and his team have expressed skepticism about the ongoing financial U.S. support for Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s incoming national security advisor, said on Dec. 15 that &quot;a blank check... just isn&#x2019;t a strategy.&quot; Kallas emphasized that, regardless of leadership, the U.S. has &quot;no interest in Russia being the strongest power in the world.&quot; A report by The Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team may propose delaying Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to oversee a ceasefire with Russia. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but has yet to provide detailed plans for achieving peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ready-to-lead-in-ukraine-support-if-us-steps-back-kallas-says/	2025-01-09T12:06:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1238851132-1.jpg
Lacking manpower to hold back Russia, Ukraine turns to its crack drone units	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story contains scenes and images that some readers might find disturbing. In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. KUPIANSK AREA, Kharkiv Oblast &#x2013; Snow, sleet, fog, the lot; when the weather is at its worst is when Russian soldiers tend to go out on assault. That&#x2019;s what the traditional wisdom dictates anyway: the harder it is for Ukrainian drones to watch and enter the battlefield, the more chances that small Russian infantry groups have of trudging their way to Ukrainian positions unscathed. After a day and night of steady snowfall, the sky begins to clear just before dawn, during the silent drive to Ukrainian drone positions south of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. Closer to the ground though, a stubborn layer of fog continues to hang, through which hares and deer can be seen bouncing out of the way of the drab green pick-up truck. The drone team wakes up around six in the morning. Though less than two kilometers from Russian positions themselves, they have set up a comfy dugout, complete with bunk beds and a heavy-duty gas heater. &#x201C;We&apos;ll have a more or less quiet day,&#x201D; says Oleksandr &#x201C;Skhid,&#x201D; the 26-year-old commander and navigator, as he opens his work laptop in the dugout, &#x201C;but since there&apos;s fog, it means that more of their infantry will be able to slip through, as there isn&apos;t very strong surveillance on our side right now.&#x201D; &#x201C;The last time we had a major mechanized assault there was bad weather.&#x201D; As the rest of the four-person team is still getting out of bed, it quickly becomes clear that the day will be far from quiet. A group of about six Russian infantrymen has been spotted by colleagues in reconnaissance, creeping forward through a snowy tree line. &#x201C;Copy, we&#x2019;ll get to work,&#x201D; Skhid relays to his commander. Having barely got out of bed, Yaroslav &#x201C;Strilok&#x201D; heads to the neighboring dugout to arm and prepare the weapon of choice: a seven-inch first-person view (FPV) drone with a custom-made fragmentation munition ziptied to the bottom. Pilot Vladyslav &#x201C;Skuba&#x201D; sits down in a lawn chair next to Skhid and dons the ubiquitous goggles, preparing to transport his human vision and dexterity inside a high-precision weapon. Skhid, meanwhile, is honing in on the location of the Russian soldiers, given away by their bright thermal signatures in the winter twilight. Within a few minutes, drones are in the air, with just about four minutes of flying between them and their targets. Soldiers of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion in a dugout near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)This FPV team belongs to the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, part of Ukraine&#x2019;s 92nd Assault Brigade, and one of the most effective drone units in the country. Initially forming as a ragtag drone reconnaissance group in May 2022 under the command of Kyiv City Council member Yuriy Fedorenko, the unit became one of Ukraine&#x2019;s first official strike drone companies in February 2023. Over the following year, with the use of drones surging on both sides of the war, Achilles forged this new type of unit with a personalized, systematized approach, from the training of the steady stream of new recruits to the organization of battlefield work. Less than a year later, the company became a battalion and is now looking to expand further to the regiment level. The rapid evolution and expansion of Ukraine&#x2019;s best drone units comes at a tumultuous time: as the country struggles against dire shortages in combat-effective infantry and Moscow looks to press its advantage ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. After two years of heavy fighting, since the area was liberated from Russian occupation in September 2022, Russian forces have made major inroads in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense of Kupiansk, reaching the Oskil River to the city&#x2019;s south in October last year. Whether it&#x2019;s FPV suicide drones or makeshift bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now often taking the lion&#x2019;s share of the task of stopping Russian assaults upon themselves. In this context, the work of next-generation soldiers like Skhid and his team is key. Still, the results are a confronting glimpse at the future of war: where everything that moves can be the target of a cheap, high-precision manhunt. &#x201C;There he is, just to the right!&#x201D; It isn&#x2019;t long after the drone reaches the tree line that Skhid spots the first enemy infantryman in the tree line on the first-person feed. By now, the Russian soldier knows he is being hunted; the chaotic screeches of an FPV are nothing like the steady whir of a reconnaissance drone, and grow deafeningly loud the closer the drone gets. Skuba looks for a way to close the distance, something that is much easier said than done in the circumstances. Touching any stray branch can easily bring down the fragile quadcopter, but hovering for too long in search of an opening also gives the targets the chance to shoot down the drone with a well-aimed rifle burst. In civilian life, Skuba lived with his young family in Bucha outside Kyiv, working as a programmer and learning the piano in his free time. Like almost all pilots like him in the military, he first learned the intricate art of FPV piloting on a computer simulator, before graduating to physical drones when he joined Achilles in the summer of 2024. Unlike commercial camera drones like the DJI Mavic model commonly used for reconnaissance, FPV drones have no in-built stabilizers: even the smallest jerk of the copter &#x2014; up, down, left, right, around &#x2014; is the result of the most delicate of manual adjustments by the pilot. &#x201C;It&apos;s a somewhat specific job,&#x201D; said Skuba. &#x201C;It&apos;s a balance between being careful enough, fast enough, and maneuvering through obstacles in the air.&#x201D; Yaroslav &quot;Strilok,&quot; a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)Having made it through the bushes, the drone bears down on the enemy. The last second of the FPV&#x2019;s video feed shows neither fight nor flight, as the Russian soldier simply keels over onto the ground with his back to his attacker. The video cuts out on impact. &#x201C;Was there an explosion?&#x201D; Skhid asks rhetorically, waiting to see the hit from the view of the reconnaissance drone. But the livestream, delayed by a few seconds, shows no explosion. &#x201C;Looks like it was a dud,&#x201D; mutters Skhid. &#x201C;Strilok, another one!&#x201D; he shouts immediately in the direction of the other dugout. Barely able to take his goggles off before the next flight, Skuba has no time for frustration; within two minutes, the drone heads out again to the same spot. This time, after a similar dance between the trees, Skuba dives in again, and this time the munition detonates. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian soldier (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)After a puff of grey smoke on the reconnaissance stream, the Russian infantryman lays still, face down amongst the bare trees. &#x201C;The mood constantly shifts, from one successful strike to the next failure, and so on, and so on,&#x201D; said Skuba. &#x201C;It&apos;s like a rollercoaster.&#x201D; Of the initial group of six Russian soldiers, two were killed in the morning&#x2019;s work, while the rest managed to scatter and take cover. With no more thermal signatures in the tree line, the team finally has time to make their first coffee of the day. Not long after the first mission, the order comes out to fly out again: the reconnaissance team has discovered how the Russian infantry got to the tree line. Two Russian armored vehicles, a BMP infantry fighting vehicle and MT-LB armored personnel carrier, stand still at an intersection in the field. &#x201C;This is the first mechanized attack we have seen in this area in a long time, maybe about six weeks,&#x201D; says Skhid. This is a common job for an FPV team: to destroy disabled and abandoned vehicles on the battlefield before Russian forces get a chance to evacuate and repair them. Inside the other dugout, Strilok prepares the munitions for the flight: first the drone, then the bomb, and finally, arming the crude wire initiator system which allows the suicide drone to detonate on impact. Dancing around the dark underground space, the bright beam of his headlamp reveals the scale of the arsenal at the team&#x2019;s disposal: over 150 kamikaze drones stacked up on shelves and ammunition boxes along the earthen walls. Each of these drones costs about $300-500: not cheap, but still a much more affordable fire asset than, for example, a Western-made 155mm howitzer shell, which usually costs about 10 times as much. First introduced to the battlefield in early 2023, the use of FPVs has been upscaled by both sides to dizzying heights. After a pledge made at the end of 2023 by President Volodymyr Zelensky to produce one million drones in the next year, Ukraine managed to not only hit but exceed the target, with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov declaring in December last year that over 1.5 million FPVs were delivered by the state in 2024. While the kamikaze drones were first used mainly for enemy vehicles, by mid-2024, top flight units like Achilles had more than enough to spend two or more each on a single enemy infantryman. A stack of first-person view suicide drones stored in a dugout of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv IndependentTall and quiet with a long scraggly beard, 28-year-old Strilok served for over a year as an assault soldier in the 92nd brigade upon the outset of the full-scale invasion, fighting tooth and nail against soldiers from Russia&#x2019;s Wagner mercenary group at the height of the Battle of Bakhmut. After being seriously wounded on the battlefield back in 2023, the Kharkiv Oblast native was discharged and could have sat out the rest of the war, but chose to rejoin the fray in a less physically demanding role. &#x201C;Back then, I only heard about FPVs a few times,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;there were Mavics dropping bombs, but it was mostly artillery, mortars, grenade launchers firing at us.&#x201D; Once Skuba&#x2019;s drone reaches the spot on the map, he picks his target: the MT-LB. Normally, this would be an easier task than hunting a moving target; the vehicles&#x2019; electronic warfare systems have run out of charge, allowing him to approach and choose his angle of attack with a high-quality video feed. Still, it is easier said than done: the MT-LB has been fitted with a chaotic array of makeshift drone protection, with cages, chains, and sheet metal crudely welded to the vehicle on all sides. &#xA0; More puffs of smoke on the video feed show that Achilles is not the only drone unit targeting the vehicles: other teams from neighboring brigades are also at work, competing in real time to get the coveted video of destroyed armor to add to their personal accounts. For a skilled pilot like Skuba, it&#x2019;s just another challenge: his first attempt lands just short, but the second is flawless: weaving through a literal chink in the armor, he dips the drone right into the open hatch, and within a few minutes, the MT-LB is in flames. &#x201C;I like how it burns,&#x201D; jokes Skhid, repeating a viral phrase used by Ukrainians to describe any juicy strike on a Russian target. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian armored vehicle (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)Across the front line in eastern Ukraine, Russia continues to use a mix of armored attacks and creeping waves of squad-level infantry assaults to storm Ukrainian positions. Unable to conduct effective combined arms offensives on a larger scale, Russian forces&#x2019; tactics often amount to simply getting as many bodies upfield as quickly as possible to overwhelm the Ukrainian defense. &#x201C;They have their pre-ordained routes, along which their infantry moves forward, position by position,&#x201D; said Skhid. &#x201C;We know where these positions are, and we are always watching them. As soon as our reconnaissance sees a group or even just a couple of them, we get to work.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some tree lines are just littered with corpses&#x2026; quite often, it happens that you&apos;re flying and can&apos;t even tell whether it&apos;s already a dead body that&apos;s been lying there for a while or someone just pretending to be dead.&#x201D; As heavy as the Russian losses are, against an overstretched Ukrainian defending force suffering severe shortages in infantry, it often works. &#x201C;It&apos;s good that there&#x2019;s more equipment, and more drones,&#x201D; said Strilok, &#x201C;and our artillery has been working much better.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s bad that there&#x2019;s no infantry, this is really bad.&#x201D; Over 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s most consistent problem on the battlefield has indeed been manpower, with the third year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war bringing with it mounting casualties and desertion rates, especially in the infantry. With the tough conditions and danger to life in the infantry well-known in society, those still joining the army voluntarily rather than through mobilization are much more likely to enter the new growth sector: drones. As a result, in the absence of a properly manned defense, it is often the presence of well-equipped crack drone units like Achilles that makes the difference between Russian attacks being eliminated in the field and gaining ground in a given area. If a sector can be saturated with enough eyes in the sky through night and day, coupled with strike teams like Skhid&#x2019;s, Ukrainian forces have a much better chance of knocking out entire Russian assault formations before the lack of defending infantry becomes a problem. But in the long term, said Skhid, there is still no replacement for the simple foot soldier. &#x201C;Right now, we&#x2019;re seeing a very heavy concentration of drones in this sector &#x2014; not just from our unit,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have relatively extensive observation here, and there are many people working with all different types of drones.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#x201C;But if there isn&#x2019;t someone physically sitting in the tree line, we won&#x2019;t be able to achieve much. We can&#x2019;t just park a drone there to hold and defend a specific tree line. It&#x2019;s a massive combination of different elements.&#x201D; After a quick lunch of ready-to-eat beef and buckwheat stew, more Russians are spotted in the foggy livestream. This time, the infantrymen &#x2014; three of them &#x2014; aren&#x2019;t sticking to the tree line, but strolling single file through an open field. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The team wastes no time: Strilok arms the drone and brings it to the launch platform outside, Skuba dons his goggles and lifts off, while Skhid keeps a keen eye on his target. Surviving a precision attack from an FPV drone is one of the most terrifying and difficult challenges for an infantryman fighting in this 21st-century war, and a far cry from the threat of artillery, which at least has much more luck involved. Just like with artillery, there is no substitute for hard cover, but if available, thick vegetation is always a good option, providing protection from view and entangling the drone&#x2019;s propellers on approach. But in an open field, there are only two options, neither of which are easy: dodge, and hope the pilot misses, or try to shoot one&#x2019;s nimble attacker out of the air. Drone pilot Vladyslav &quot;Skuba&quot; flying a first-person view drone inside a dugout near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)The first infantryman fails to do either. Running in a straight line, he makes an easy target for Skuba, who does not miss. After the hit is confirmed on the livestream, he squirms for a few more seconds before lying still. Straight away, the next drone takes off. Skuba doesn&#x2019;t remove his goggles, transporting his eyes straight into the camera of the next quadcopter as they sync automatically. By now, the Russian assault group knows they are under attack, but continues marching forward anyway. The second Russian soldier opts for the dodging method, with some success. After several unsuccessful passes, the suicide drone explodes on the ground a meter and a half away from his feet. He rises from the ground, disoriented but still carrying his rifle, and begins limping, clearly hurt badly by shrapnel. &#xA0; &#x201C;It&apos;s still not always easy, but with each trip, it gets calmer,&#x201D; said Skuba of his work. &#x201C;You start seeing them as a target, you figure out how to approach, you plan your route. The more you know, the more you organize everything, the easier it is to take it step by step.&#x201D; The last member of the Russian assault team is running for cover as the third drone arrives, having shown no interest in helping his wounded comrade. Unlike the others, this one decides to shoot. Turning over his shoulder, the Russian soldier faces the drone, raises his Kalashnikov rifle, and in a split second, Skuba&#x2019;s FPV video feed cuts out. Remarkably, the second attempt to target the soldier is met with the same result. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a bloody sniper, f***!&#x201D; shouts Skhid in frustration. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian soldier (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)More and more, soldiers on both sides have begun to carry shotguns out on missions specifically for protection against drones, but shooting an FPV out of the sky with a rifle while being actively targeted is no mean feat. Whether through luck or a mix of skill and ice-cold nerves, the Russian infantryman&#x2019;s sharpshooting gives him just enough time to make it to proper cover. With the light slowly fading on this short, grey day at war, Skuba flies out one more time to the same field. The wounded soldier is no longer limping. Laying on his back, but still moving, he could yet be evacuated and return to the fight. For Skhid, whose family home in Kharkiv Oblast is less than 50 kilometers from these positions, there is no taking chances. Skuba closes in, and after a direct hit to the torso, the Russian soldier&#x2019;s journey into Ukraine with an invading army meets its permanent end. &#xA0; &#x201C;Feelings sometimes rise up during work due to outside events,&#x201D; said Skuba of the emotional side of his often gruesome work, &#x201C;it could be something with family, with loved ones, a tragedy related to the war. All of that can accumulate, of course, and some anger, resentment toward the Russians builds up.&#x201D; &#x201C;But sometimes&#x2026; sometimes it&#x2019;s just zen, it&#x2019;s just this smooth, constant work. We see the targets, and we engage them.&#x201D; Hi, this is Francis Farrell, the author of this piece. It&apos;s quite a rare thing that as a journalist spending just a day with soldiers, that you are witness to this much action. What I saw in my time with Achilles is proof of two things: first, how damn good these guys are at their jobs, and second, how damn good Russia is at throwing endless waves of humans at Ukrainian defenses. This type of cyberpunk battlefield matchup could be defining for the war in 2025. Whatever ends up happening, you can count on the fact that we will take you right there. &#xA0;Please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/lacking-manpower-to-hold-back-russia-ukraine-turns-to-its-crack-drone-units/	2025-01-09T11:19:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/DSCF6208.jpg
Zelensky, NATO chief discuss air defense, arms production at Ramstein meeting	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Jan. 9 to discuss strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defense and obtaining Western funding for the country&apos;s arms production. &quot;The common task of our partners is to ensure a strong position for Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace. Today, we also discussed how NATO&apos;s platform can be used to reach this goal,&quot; Zelensky said. Rutte reiterated the alliance&apos;s unwavering support for Kyiv. &quot;NATO is committed to continuing our support as you defend yourselves and fight tirelessly for the freedom we all hold dear,&quot; he said. Zelensky emphasized involving NATO members in purchasing Ukrainian weapons under a model pioneered by Denmark. The Danish government became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Zelensky also met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, focusing on battlefield dynamics, the evolving role of drones, and Ukraine&apos;s needs for various drone types. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), formed in April 2022 and comprising 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, coordinates international military aid to Ukraine. This meeting is expected to be the last in its current format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Jan. 8. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, which includes air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. Zelensky is also scheduled for bilateral meetings during the summit, continuing efforts to bolster international support for Ukraine as the country seeks a stronger defense position and a pathway toward a just peace	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-nato-chief-discuss-air-defense-arms-cooperation-at-ramstein-meeting/	2025-01-09T10:42:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/dbb31c1780fefd0b47d00e3b51938b1b_1736432495.jpeg
Russia’s gas sector is running out of options after end of transit deal	Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to end the gas transit deal with Russian energy giant Gazprom has been hailed by President Volodymyr Zelensky as one of Moscow&#x2019;s biggest defeats. &quot;When (Russian President) Vladimir Putin was handed power in Russia over 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through Ukraine to Europe stood at over 130 billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is zero. This is one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 1 just as the deal expired. Moscow and Kyiv signed the agreement in 2019 to transit 40 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually through Ukraine to buyers in the EU. Gazprom raked in an estimated $5&#x2013;$6.5 billion annually from the deal with Ukraine.Europe began to wean itself off Russian gas after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. Russian pipeline gas deliveries to Europe dropped to around 29 bcm last year with around 14 bcm traveling through Ukraine before Kyiv terminated the deal, according to Argus Media, a market analyst group. The Ukrainian route transited nearly half of Russia&#x2019;s pipeline gas exports to Europe, while the rest went through the TurkStream pipeline in the Balkans. Kyiv&#x2019;s decision to end the deal will further undermine gas revenue to Russia&#x2019;s economy as Moscow will struggle to find alternatives to replace this lost gas market in the near future. For now, Russia still has its claws on Europe with cheap liquified natural gas (LNG) and growing gas transit through the TurkStream pipeline. Those two revenue streams could run out, however, as sanctions bite and Europe looks to continue distancing itself from Russian energy. The majority of European states have already looked to gas alternatives from the U.S., Norway, and Algeria to reduce dependency on Russia. The end of the agreement forces those who clung to the Ukraine route, namely Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, to find other options. &#x201C;This development is a step toward a Europe that is less susceptible to energy blackmail, marking a geopolitical win for Ukraine and its allies,&#x201D; the former head of Ukraine&#x2019;s gas transport operator (GTSOU) Sergiy Makogon told the Kyiv Independent. The last three years have put a &#x201C;significant strain&#x201D; on Gazprom, Makogon noted. The company suffered a sharp reduction in gas production from 515 bcm in 2021 to 355 bcm in 2023, which it largely blamed on Europe&#x2019;s move away from Russian gas, while also paying hefty taxes to prop up Moscow&#x2019;s war machine. Europe&#x2019;s efforts to wean itself off Russian gas meant volumes dropped from 150 bcm pre-war to less than 50 bcm in 2023, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11, 2024. The end of the Ukraine route is another amputation for Gazprom after the loss of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and the Yamal pipeline through Poland in 2022. &#x201C;Moscow has limited options for now to sell more gas to other markets to make up for the loss of Ukrainian transit,&#x201D; Natasha Fielding, the head of European gas pricing at Argus Media, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&#x2019;s final lifeline to Europe is the TurkStream pipeline that delivers Russian gas to Greece, the Western Balkans, and Hungary via Turkey. TurkStream is sanctioned by the U.S. and a Dutch court withdrew the export license of the Netherlands-based Russian company operating the pipeline in September 2022 but renewed it weeks later following pressure from Moscow and Budapest.

(Serbian Presidency / Handout / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)&#x201C;Europe can completely phase out Russian pipeline gas including by stopping the TurkStream pipeline,&#x201D; said Martin Vladimirov, the Director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD). Even if Europe does not embargo TurkStream, there is little room for more gas to flow through the pipeline. Deliveries jumped from 12.2 bcm in 2023 to 14.95 bcm in 2024, but the pipeline has a maximum capacity of 15.75 bcm per year, Fielding notes. Zelensky also mentioned the possibility of increasing U.S. gas imports to Europe which would lower prices. If the U.S. boosts LNG exports by 22.5 bcm this year, it would &#x201C;wipe out&#x201D; Russian pipeline gas supply in Central and Eastern Europe, said Vladimirov. Even China, which overtook Europe as the biggest guzzler of Russian pipeline gas last year, consuming 31 bcm, is a limited market for now, Fielding said. Russia cannot reroute gas flows through the 38 bcm &#x201C;Power of Siberia&#x201D; pipeline as it is not connected to the gas fields serving Europe and its transit already hit full capacity in December. Russia&#x2019;s two future pipeline projects with China are also yet to get off the ground. &#x201C;Russia will find it hard to get to pre-war gas export levels even if it is able to redirect exports to Asia after potentially losing all gas exports to Europe by the end of the decade,&#x201D; Vladimirov said. Russia&#x2019;s main LNG company, Novatek, has hooked European companies on its cheap LNG with 20% discounts leading to record-high purchases in 2024 of nearly 17 million tons, according to the CSD. While Brussels has not directly banned the chilled Russian fuel, it has sanctioned LNG transshipment &#x2014; transferring LNG from one ship to another&#x2014; making it harder for Moscow to sell beyond the European market. This could have helped spike Russian LNG sales to the EU, said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank, and at the Helmholtz Center Berlin, a research institute. The EU gobbled up 48% of Russia&#x2019;s total LNG exports in November 2024. One of the biggest consumers, France, imported Russian LNG worth 252 million euros ($262 million) during that month, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). While less profitable than pipeline gas, Russia still makes close to $2 billion a month from its LNG sales to Asia and Europe, said Vladimirov. &#x201C;With no sanctions imposed on Russian LNG, companies are operating in their own self-interest and buying increasing quantities of gas from the cheapest supplier &#x2014; Russia,&#x201D; Vaibhav Raghunandan, EU-Russia Analyst at CREA, told the Kyiv Independent. Despite this, Russia&#x2019;s LNG sector is constrained. Its LNG terminals are already producing at near full capacity and it cannot easily reroute the gas originally transited through Ukraine to its two LNG export plants. In theory, Russia&#x2019;s new LNG export projects, like the Arctic LNG 2 project, could bolster sales abroad by 80 bcm, Vladimirov said. But Western sanctions on all new and future projects, including on Arctic LNG 2, are biting Moscow&#x2019;s progress by blocking its access to critical equipment like tankers and liquefaction technology.

(Kirill Morozov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The Arctic LNG 2 project was launched in late 2023 and aimed to produce 20 bcm of gas annually, but Novatek cut production to almost zero in November 2024. Novatek&#x2019;s setbacks show that &#x201C;it would be very difficult for Russia not only to complete the infrastructure but also buy the ice-breaker LNG carriers necessary to facilitate bigger exports to Asia,&#x201D; said Vladimirov. Moscow has increasingly relied on its shadow tankers to continue its LNG trade as sanctions hamper shipping logistics, he added. Finding secure buyers if output is increased will also be challenging, particularly if the EU heeds the calls to ban Russian LNG imports this year. Threats of secondary sanctions are also likely to turn off potential buyers. Russia paid Ukraine $800 million annually to transport its gas. However, net revenue only totaled between $200-300 million after transit costs, according to Makogon. Kyiv considered the economic consequences but ultimately made the decision to kill the deal in the &#x201C;interest of national security,&#x201D; the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Moreover, it also undermines Russia&#x2019;s leverage on Europe&#x2019;s energy sector. &#x201C;Russia has used gas transit as both an economic and political weapon, influencing EU policies and creating divisions among member states,&#x201D; Makogon said. Europe will feel an expensive knock-on effect in exchange for its security, Fielding said, as Slovakia, Austria, and Czechia will have to pay more to source and transport non-Russian gas. Western Europe, particularly Germany, will have to increase gas flows to the east to replace the lost Russian gas, she added.

Germany continues to receive a significant portion of its natural gas from Russia, despite recent reductions in gas flow through pipelines, prompting warnings of potential shortages. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Slovakia, which could pay an extra 90 million euros to replace the Russian gas this year, has ramped up rhetoric against Ukraine with Prime Minister Robert Fico threatening to cut electricity exports to Ukraine last month. However, the country&#x2019;s electricity transmission system operator, SEPS, confirmed on Jan 4 that it will continue to send electricity to Ukraine. &#x201C;Slovakia and Austria had long prepared for this moment by signing contracts with alternative suppliers and keeping their underground gas reserves topped up. They must now put this plan into action,&#x201D; Fielding said. Ukraine is also preparing for Russia to attack its gas transit network in retaliation, said CEO of the GTSOU Dmytro Lyppa on Dec. 4. Russia has already relentlessly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including gas storage sites, and Makogon said that Ukraine is &#x201C;well prepared&#x201D; to repair and restore damaged infrastructure. &#x201C;Additionally, we would not hesitate to retaliate by targeting Russia&#x2019;s gas networks and storages, just as we have targeted their oil refineries,&#x201D; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-gas-sector-is-running-out-of-options-after-end-of-transit-deal/	2025-01-09T09:49:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1662623992.jpg
Slovak PM threatens Ukraine with aid cuts over halted Russian gas transit	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico escalated threats against Ukraine on Jan. 9, warning of severe consequences in response to Kyiv&#x2019;s suspension of Russian gas transit, Slovak media outlet Teraz.sk reported. He was speaking after talks with EU officials in Brussels. Kyiv terminated Russian gas transit on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. Slovakia, which had previously imported Russian gas through Ukraine, has voiced concerns over the decision&apos;s economic impact. Fico said that Slovakia could halt its humanitarian aid to Ukraine, cut or cancel social benefits for Ukrainian refugees, and cease emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. He also suggested using Slovakia&apos;s veto power over EU decisions as leverage against Kyiv. The prime minister noted that these steps would only be taken if Slovakia &quot;has no other choice.&quot; Fico also announced the immediate formation of a working group comprising representatives from Slovakia, Ukraine, and the European Commission to address the issue. The Jan. 7 meeting between Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives in Brussels was canceled after Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko remained in Kyiv to address urgent energy issues. Hungary has also expressed opposition to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy policies. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticized a Ukrainian parliamentary bill proposing a halt to Russian oil and gas transit during martial law, calling it &quot;unacceptable&quot; in a Jan. 8 Facebook post. Szijjarto underscored Hungary&apos;s power to influence Ukraine&#x2019;s EU aspirations, noting that all member states must unanimously approve new admissions. Since taking office, Fico has shifted Slovakia&#x2019;s foreign policy, halting military aid to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric more aligned with Russia, raising concerns among Kyiv and European partners. Despite the EU&#x2019;s push to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains dependent on Russian gas, bound by a long-term contract with Gazprom, Moscow&apos;s state-owned energy giant.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-threatens-ukraine-with-aid-cuts-over-halted-russian-gas-transit-pm-fico-says/	2025-01-09T09:20:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
4,000 North Korean troops killed or wounded fighting against Ukraine, Zelensky claims	North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Interfax Ukraine reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. The claim comes as North Korea has deepened its military ties with Moscow. Dorothy Camille Shea, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., said on Jan. 8 that more than 12,000 North Korean troops were in Russia. &quot;Putin is not just maintaining his investment in aggression. He&apos;s doubling down. He&apos;s even started hiring soldiers from North Korea to keep this war going,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;North Korea is learning modern methods of warfare. They do not value their people. They have lost 4,000 people so far.&quot; North Korea&apos;s involvement is seen as mutually beneficial for Pyongyang and Moscow. Shea warned that North Korea is gaining &quot;valuable combat experience&quot; and receiving Russian military equipment and technology, which could enhance its capacity to wage war. Pyongyang reportedly deployed its troops to Kursk Oblast last fall to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued to fight in the region, seeking to retain it as leverage for future negotiations with Russia. In his Jan. 5 interview with Lex Fridman, Zelensky also warned that Pyongyang could send an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-000-north-korean-troops-killed-or-wounded-fighting-in-ukraine-zelensky-claims/	2025-01-09T08:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157765664.jpg
Ukraine offers defense industry jobs, draft exemptions for citizens abroad, minister says	Ukraine is prepared to provide jobs at defense enterprises for citizens abroad and exempt them from the mobilization of conscripts, National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on Jan. 8, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;We have a shortage of professionals, and Ukraine is ready to exempt most of them from military service,&quot; Chernyshov said. To address this need, the Ukrainian government plans to establish centers to assist citizens abroad in finding jobs in both Ukraine and their current countries of residence, he added. These centers aim to guide individuals toward career paths that can benefit Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Chernyshov expressed confidence that many Ukrainians would take advantage of these opportunities. Neighboring countries, including Poland and Lithuania, have suggested they may assist Ukraine in facilitating the return of fighting-aged men, though no concrete measures have been announced. Meanwhile, nations like Germany and Estonia have extended temporary residency permits for Ukrainian refugees, even in cases where passports have expired. Ukraine lowered its mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but has resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. These new initiatives reflect the government&apos;s efforts to balance workforce needs in critical sectors with national defense requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offers-defense-industry-jobs-mobilization-exemptions-for-citizens-abroad-minister-says/	2025-01-09T07:17:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1246299242.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 8	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 8 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 1&#x2013;5, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament may consider a draft law on establishing a new High Administrative Court The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, is set to discuss revised draft law #12368 on establishing a new High Administrative Court during its Jan. 8-10, 2025 session. The bill, critical for meeting Ibenchmarks, awaits approval from the Committee on Legal Policy before proceeding to a vote. It remains unclear if Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will address the revised draft law to repeal the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; this week. ARMA Legislation Submitted The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has submitted draft law No. 12374 to amend the legislation governing the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA).

Kyiv, Washington in talks on licensing air defense production in Ukraine, Zelensky says	Ukraine is negotiating with the U.S. to obtain licenses to manufacture air defense systems and missiles on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9. Zelensky made this statement at the opening of the 25th Ramstein summit, which was dedicated to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defenses, particularly its air defense. This summit will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. about licensing air defense systems and missile production here in Ukraine. And this could become a significant part of our security guarantees. And it is absolutely possible to do it,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky mentioned the Russian Jan. 8 attack on Zaporizhzhia, which killed 13 people and injured more than 100, and called for additional air defense systems for Ukraine. &quot;This is just one day, just one attack, just one air strike. We need to stop the Russian terror. And you can do it. We ask for immediate delivery of air defense systems,&quot; the president said. In December 2024, Zelensky said he had repeatedly asked the U.S. to provide licenses to produce Patriot systems in Ukraine but had not received permission. &quot;I have asked the U.S. many times to grant licenses for the production of Patriot (air defense system). No one seemed to mind. No one has ever told me: &apos;No, we won&apos;t give you one.&apos; But so far, we have not received anything,&quot; Zelensky told Le Parisien on Dec. 18. The president added that in the three years of war, Ukraine has not yet received the number of air defense systems it needs to defend itself against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-washington-in-talks-on-air-defense-productions-licensing-in-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-01-09T06:02:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2156549690.jpg
Russia paid Taliban $200,000 per killed US, coalition soldier, media investigation says	Russia&apos;s military intelligence (GRU) offered a $200,000 bounty to Afghan militants for every U.S. or coalition soldier killed before Washington announced its withdrawal from the country, The Insider and Der Spiegel reported on Jan. 8. The joint media investigation sheds fresh details on reports of Russia-sponsored killings of U.S. soldiers that first surfaced in 2020, including names of Russian intelligence officers and their local collaborators involved. According to the investigation, the operation was overseen by Lieutenant General Ivan Kasyanenko, deputy commander of Unit 29155, a notorious group connected to Sergei Skripal poisoning in the U.K. and sabotage operations in Europe. Russia reportedly paid the Taliban at least $30 million altogether for attacks on coalition soldiers. GRU contracted the killings to ramp up pressure against Western countries and force their retreat from the country, The Insider and Der Spiegel wrote. The attacks stopped after then-U.S. President Donald Trump struck a deal in early 2020 to withdraw from Afghanistan. The investigation also said that both the former Afghan administration and the U.S. were aware of the bounty program. The National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan&apos;s security agency before the Taliban takeover in 2021, learned about the scheme during interrogations of Taliban militants in mid-2019, the investigation said. Trump was broadly criticized at the time for inaction in the face of intelligence leaks pointing to Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers. The former president, who is returning to the White House on Jan. 20 for his second term, acknowledged he had never approached Russian President Vladimir Putin about the reports. Trump has often voiced his sympathies for the Russian leader and said he trusts him more than U.S. intelligence on several occasions. Joe Biden, who was then running for president, criticized Trump at the time, but his administration later downplayed the reports. Biden finalized the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which was followed by a quick collapse of the Afghan administration and the Taliban&apos;s takeover. The Insider and Der Spiegel also reported that Russia&apos;s operations in Afghanistan went beyond the bounty program. Moscow was attempting to undermine the U.S.-led coalition with the help of the Taliban and Iran since the start of the intervention in 2001, the investigation claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-paid-afghan-militants-200-000-per-killed-us-coalition-soldier-media-investigation-says/	2025-01-09T05:48:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Afghanistan.jpg
Denmark, Norway to buy $183 million in arms for Kyiv from Ukrainian manufacturers in 2025	Denmark and Norway are expected to spend 178 million euros ($183 million) on arms purchases from Ukrainian manufacturers in 2025, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Jan. 9. Denmark has reserved 135 million euros ($139 million) for further purchases under the &quot;Danish model,&quot; buying arms for Ukraine directly from Ukrainian arms manufacturers. Norway is expected to contribute another 43 million euros ($44 million) to this initiative. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have already received weapons worth almost 538 million euros ($554 million) through direct purchases from Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, according to the ministry. The sources of funding were 390 million euros ($402 million) in proceeds from frozen Russian assets, 125 million euros ($129 million) from the Danish government through the Danish National Ukraine Fund, 20 million euros ($21 million) from Sweden, and another 2.7 million euros ($2.8 million) from Iceland. At the end of September 2024, Denmark announced it would invest 4.2 billion Danish kroner ($630 million) in the Ukrainian defense industry. Denmark is the first country with which Ukraine has started joint weapons production, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Danish funds were used to purchase domestically made arms, such as the Bohdana self-propelled artillery systems capable of firing 155 mm NATO-standard shells. Lithuania has also adopted the Danish model for Ukraine. It will invest 10 million euros ($10.3 million) in producing the Ukrainian long-range drone-missile Palianytsia.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-norway-expected-to-purchase-weapons-worth-183-million-from-ukrainian-manufacturers-in-2025/	2025-01-09T05:35:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-16_48_24.png
Ukraine's 47th Brigade releases video of 'massive' Russian attack repelled in Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade said on Jan. 9 that it had, together with other units, repelled a &quot;massive&quot; Russian assault in the embattled Kursk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 50 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. The Russian attack reportedly involved about 50 vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and buggies. According to the brigade, Russian troops initially tried to demine the approaches to Ukrainian positions and attacked in six waves. Russia deployed &quot;a huge number of soldiers,&quot; with Ukrainian forces killing 45 troops and injuring 53, the military claimed. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Jan. 9, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade/Telegram)&quot;Tanks, BMP-2, BMD, APCs (armored personnel carriers), buggies and Lancets &#x2014; our soldiers and comrades burned Russian equipment worth tens of millions of dollars,&quot; the brigade said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. No further details on the attack were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-47th-brigade-releases-video-of-massive-russian-attack-being-repelled-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-09T04:48:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-09-142759.png
Zelensky to meet with Italian PM, president in Italy after Ramstein summit, media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Italy on Jan. 9, Suspilne reported, citing its undisclosed source. Zelensky is attending the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, also known as Ramstein format, on Jan. 9. The president will travel to Italy following the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Zelensky was also scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden in Italy, but the U.S. leader canceled the trip due to the wildfires in California, according to Suspilne. Zelensky previously announced a series of meetings with international partners to discuss further support for Ukraine in the war against Russia. Speaking at the Ramstein format meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; he said. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-with-italian-pm-president-in-italy-after-ramstein-summit-suspilne-reports/	2025-01-09T04:33:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-and-Meloni-1.jpeg
Russian forces 2 km from Kupiansk's outskirts, official says	The key northeastern Ukrainian town of Kupiansk now lies only 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the front line as Russian troops sustain their attacks, Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on national television on Jan. 9. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk last September and approached its industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attempts at entering the town throughout December. &quot;The situation is very difficult; the front line is 2 kilometers from the town&apos;s outskirts. Russia is constantly attempting to attack,&quot; Besedin said. The Russian army also conducted 12 attacks on Jan. 8 in the direction of the settlements of Holubivka and Petropavlika, located nearly 6 kilometers (3 miles) from Kupiansk, according to Besedin. The estimated Russian advance near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 8, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Russian troops are trying to reach the main Svatove-Kupiansk highway to enter the eastern part of the town, Besedin added. &quot;The situation is very difficult and threatens the Kupiansk and Vovchansk sectors (of the front line). Russia is trying to gain a foothold in the town of Dvorichna, on the western bank of the Oskil (River). If they manage to transfer equipment to the western bank, there will be a threat of a rear attack in the Vovchansk sector and Kupiansk,&quot; he said. Besedin added that residents of the Kupiansk community, despite the poor infrastructure, are not in a hurry to evacuate. On average, only five people leave the community&apos;s 12 settlements per day. Some 900 people, primarily elderly, remain in the eastern part of the community and firmly refuse to be evacuated, according to the local military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-near-kupiansk/	2025-01-09T03:55:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114559-1.jpg
Biden administration unveils its final $500 million aid package for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Jan. 9 a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. The package was unveiled at the Ramstein summit in Germany. It is expected to be the final U.S. defense tranche provided by the Biden administration before Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The incoming U.S. leadership changes have also cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 57 countries that has been coordinating aid for Ukraine since April 2022. &quot;Month after month, members of this Contact Group have helped provide, produce, and sustain the systems and the munitions that Ukraine needs,&quot; Austin said in his address to the meeting alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. &quot;So we must not let up. That&apos;s why I am announcing today another presidential drawdown authority package valued at approximately $500 million. &quot;It includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more ammunition, and more air-to-ground munitions and other equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s F-16s.&quot; Around $3.8 billion remains allocated for Ukraine under the presidential drawdown authority, which enables Washington to provide arms and equipment to Kyiv directly from the Pentagon&apos;s stocks. The future of these funds under the incoming Trump administration is uncertain. Speaking at the meeting, Austin highlighted the Ramstein group&apos;s progress over more than two and half years of its existence, including eight &quot;capability coalitions&quot; led by 14 countries. &quot;Earlier today, the Coalition Leadership Group met again, including representatives from those 15 countries. And they endorsed Capability Coalition roadmaps leading to the year 2027,&quot; Austin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-unveils-its-final-500-million-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-01-09T03:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2181251042.jpg
It would be crazy to drop the ball now' — Zelensky urges continued unity, support for Ukraine at Ramstein	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Ramstein airbase in Germany on Jan. 9, delivering an opening address to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting. Zelensky is expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings during the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to unveil a $500 million aid package for Ukraine at the meeting, the last military aid tranche provided by the Biden administration. Around $3.8 billion remains allocated under the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), leaving it uncertain whether Trump will continue using this tool to funnel arms to Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; the president noted. The UDCG comprises 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, and was formed in April 2022 to coordinate international support for Ukraine. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz implied earlier this week that the Jan. 9 meeting might be the last one in the current format.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-joins-ramstein-summit-in-germany/	2025-01-09T03:03:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russian airstrike against Kherson injures 6, damages kindergarten	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian forces dropped guided aerial bombs on the city of Kherson on Jan. 9, injuring at least six people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. One bomb reportedly hit a house, destroying it. A kindergarten and a business were also reported as damaged. The victims included two women and four men who suffered blast injuries and shrapnel wounds. One victim was treated on the spot, and the rest have been hospitalized, Prokudin said. One more resident suffered shock, according to officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-airstrike-against-kherson-injures-6-damages-kindergarten/	2025-01-09T02:54:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-09_12-12-48.jpg
Military deserter, his wife detained in Dnipro terror attack case	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the police detained a married couple suspected of producing an explosive used in a Dnipro terrorist attack last December on Russia&apos;s behalf, the SBU said on Jan. 9. One person was killed and four injured, including two police officers, in an explosion in the central-eastern city of Dnipro on Dec. 14, 2024, near a military enlistment office. The newly detained suspects, a 33-year-old soldier who went AWOL (absent without leave) and his 25-year-old wife, were looking for &quot;easy money&quot; and were recruited via the Telegram messenger by Russian intelligence services, the SBU said. They are believed to have acted separately from the suspected perpetrator of the attack, a 37-year-old resident who was detained within hours of the explosion and has also been accused of acting on Russia&apos;s behalf. The married couple made the improvised explosive device based on Russian intelligence&apos;s instructions and stashed them in a hiding place. Subsequently, they watched the terrorist attack being carried out and went into hiding, the SBU said. Law enforcement officers detained the suspects at their new addresses and seized mobile phones and clothes containing evidence of their acts. The two have been charged with terrorism and face life in prison. Russia has been accused of plotting numerous terrorist attacks in Ukraine in an effort to sow panic and undermine the country&apos;s resistance amid the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-more-suspects-detained-in-dnipro-terror-attack-case/	2025-01-09T02:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-09_10-00-12.jpg
Russian propagandist, Crimean Bridge film director Keosayan in coma after suffering clinical death	Russian propagandist and film director Tigran Keosayan has suffered a clinical death and is in a coma, his wife and Russia Today editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said on her Telegram channel on Jan. 8. Keosayan, 59, was hospitalized in late December. His condition is serious, according to Russian media outlet Baza. The Russian propagandist previously suffered a heart attack in 2008 and 2010 and underwent aortocoronary stenting. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to until the last minute, but since reporters have already started calling, I&apos;ll write it myself. My husband, Tigran Keosayan, has suffered a clinical death and is in a coma. As many people know, he has had a very sick heart for a long time,&quot; Simonyan said. Keosayan hosted the International Pilorama program on the Russian state-controlled NTV channel. His directorial career began in 1992. Since then, he has directed about 20 films, including the propaganda film &quot;The Crimean Bridge. Made with Love!&quot; The film takes place during the construction of the Crimean Bridge, which Russia built to link the Russian-occupied peninsula with the Russian mainland. The structure became a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In March 2020, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny released a video where he alleged serious corruption violations during the film&apos;s production. According to Navalny, at least 46 million rubles (nearly $ 449,000) of state funds intended for the film were diverted to Simonyan&apos;s relatives. Following the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Keosayan was subject to sanctions by the European Union, the U.K., Canada, and other countries. In October 2022, he was added to Ukraine&apos;s sanctions list for spreading anti-Ukrainian propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-propagandist-in-coma-clinical-death/	2025-01-09T02:18:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1052453150.jpg
Armenia's government backs bill on launching EU accession process	The Armenian government on Jan. 9 supported a draft law on initiating the country&apos;s accession process with the European Union, Armenia News reported. The government &quot;expressed a positive stance&quot; on the bill, which was submitted as a citizens&apos; initiative. It has been submitted to Armenia&apos;s parliament for consideration, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stressed that even if the bill is passed, the accession process can start only if the Armenian people support it in a referendum. &quot;But if the law is adopted, we must have some idea about our next steps&quot; and &quot;discuss with the EU the road map that they imagine and that we imagine,&quot; Pashinyan said at a government meeting. The prime minister noted that the bill should be approached without &quot;undue enthusiasm&quot; and that the country should currently focus on developing more practical steps, such as visa liberalization. Speaking in the European Parliament in October 2023, Pashinyan said that his country is ready to align more closely with the bloc, though he later expressed doubts about whether Armenia is ready for full membership. Pashinyan spoke in the EU&apos;s legislature shortly after Russia, Armenia&apos;s traditional ally, failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to a rapid deterioration of ties between Yerevan and Moscow. Last March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the EU&apos;s executive bodies to strengthen relations with Armenia. The parliament also said Armenia meets the Maastricht Treaty requirements to apply for membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/armenias-government-backs-bill-on-launching-eu-accession-process/	2025-01-09T01:44:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2133933919.jpg
Ex-FBI informant accused of lying about Biden family's ties to Ukrainian business jailed for 6 years	A Californian court sentenced former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who falsely accused the Biden family of taking a bribe from a Ukrainian business, to six years in prison, CNN reported on Jan. 8. Smirnov is accused of tax evasion and making false statements that U.S. President Joe Biden and his son Hunter each received $5 million from Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Smirnov was also obliged to pay about $675,000 in reimbursement to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to compensate for tax evasion, according to CNN. During the 2020 investigation, Smirnov alleged that members of Burisma&apos;s management team told him in 2015 and 2016 that they hired Biden&apos;s son to defend the company against legal issues in the U.S. and gave them a $10 million bribe. Biden was then the U.S. vice president under President Barack Obama. Hunter Biden served on Burisma&apos;s board of directors from 2014-2019. The FBI examined the case and, after a few months, recommended closing it, but the Republicans in Congress initiated a parliamentary investigation in 2023 in the hope of impeaching Biden. Special prosecutor David Weiss, who led the investigation, said Smirnov had slandered Biden, citing personal animosity. Born in the Soviet Union, Smirnov emigrated to Israel with his family as a child and later moved to the U.S. He became a naturalized citizen and an informant for the FBI. According to prosecutors, he later began to express bias against Biden and invented a narrative about bribery in Ukraine to harm Biden&apos;s campaign against Donald Trump in 2020. According to the court, Smirnov also had ties to Russian intelligence services. He was arrested in Nevada in February 2024 when he returned to the U.S. from abroad. Smirnov faced a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison, but under the terms of the agreement, he was due four to six years and a fine. Smirnov&apos;s defense insisted on four years, noting that the man &quot;suffers from serious eye-related health problems&quot; and a lengthy sentence would &quot;unreasonably prolong his suffering.&quot; Weiss indicted Hunter Biden on tax and arms trafficking charges. In 2024, a jury found him guilty of three gun-related crimes, and he later pleaded guilty to nine federal tax offenses. Outgoing President Biden unconditionally pardoned his son in December before the verdict in both cases.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-fbi-informant-sentenced/	2025-01-09T00:58:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187280340.jpg
Russian tanker fuel spill could reach Ukraine's coast, Navy warns	The fuel spilled into the Black Sea by two Russian tankers last month could reach Ukraine&apos;s southern coast in the Mykolaiv and Odesa oblasts, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on air on Jan. 9. Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239 suffered severe damage in the Kerch Strait during a storm on Dec. 15, 2024. Each vessel reportedly carried 4,000 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. &quot;The current direction indicates that, most likely, the oil fuel can reach our Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts&apos; coasts,&quot; Pletenchuk said on national television. Greenpeace Ukraine warned the spill may cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage and foul the shoreline if the fuel is driven ashore. The spokesperson noted that Russian civilian vessels continue to sail through the Kerch Strait since &quot;without oil exports and subsequent profits, it will be even more difficult for them to wage this war.&quot; Days after the spill, the oil fuel washed ashore in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai and the Russian-occupied Crimea. Krasnodar Krai residents shared footage of birds injured by the spill and unable to fly. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farmland. In October 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers poses significant environmental risks, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-tanker-oil-spill-could-reach-ukraines-coast-navy-warns/	2025-01-09T00:41:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2149505233.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 19, injure 132 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 19 civilians and injured at least 132 over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 9, with most of the casualties reported following an airstrike on Zaporizhzhia. Russia launched 70 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-six drones were shot down over nine regions, while 24 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. A Russian airstrike against an industrial facility in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Jan. &#xA0;8 killed at least 13 people and injured at least 113, the State Emergency Service said the following day. Fifty-nine people have been hospitalized, of whom 10 are in serious condition. Elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, two people were killed and two injured in a Russian attack against the village of Stepnohirsk, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Kharkiv Oblast, two women aged 42 and 67 were injured on the evening of Jan. 8 after a Russian drone attack against the village of Nove Pekelne, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The victims did not require hospitalization. Four people were killed and 10 injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Two high-rise buildings, four houses, agricultural machinery, and cars were damaged. Five civilians were injured in Russian strikes in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 8, including three in the Seredyna-Buda community and two in the Yunakiv community, the regional military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-118/	2025-01-08T23:27:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_16-34-43.jpg
White House calls halt of Russian gas transit via Ukraine one of Moscow's 'most costly defeats'	The shutdown of Russian gas transit through Ukrainian territory is one of Moscow&apos;s &quot;most costly defeats,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, as reported by Ukrinform on Jan. 8. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. Ukraine&apos;s move will deprive Russia of about $6.5 billion in annual revenue from gas sales to Europe, according to Kirby. The spokesperson added that the U.S. also tries to make Russia suffer losses through sanctions and export restrictions. Meanwhile, Washington is trying to increase energy supplies to Europe, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). According to Kirby, currently, 50% of European LNG imports come from the U.S. The spokesperson mentioned that 25 years ago, when Russian President Vladimir Putin took office, more than 130 billion cubic meters of gas were transported to Europe through Ukraine, and today this figure is zero. Following Ukraine&apos;s termination of Russian gas transportation through its territory, gas prices in Europe rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros per megawatt-hour. This rise is the highest since October 2023 and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe. The halt also coincided with a major gas outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which relied on transit through Ukraine, according to its gas supplier Tiraspoltransgaz-Pridnestrovie. Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom claimed that the halt of gas supplies to Moldova was caused by alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues.	https://kyivindependent.com/kirby-calls-termination-of-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine-one-of-moscows-most-costly-defeats/	2025-01-08T23:17:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/gettyimages-1249025066-1679492490evazd.jpeg
Transnistria has less than month of gas left, local authorities say	Gas storage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Transnistria will last another 24 days after the halt of Russian supplies, local authorities said on Jan. 8. Transnistria faces a major crisis after Russia&apos;s state-owned Gazprom company halted gas supplies to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debt. While the government-held part of the country relies on EU energy supplies, the Transnistrian region, occupied by Russia since the 1990s, is still heavily dependent on Russia. Sergei Obolonik, the deputy head of the region&apos;s executive branch, said that Transnistria faces not only an energy crisis but also a humanitarian one. &quot;The gas reserve of 13 million cubic meters enables us to supply several social institutions and other facilities crucial for the functioning of the society, as well as multi-residential buildings for cooking,&quot; the authorities said in a statement on a website. The administration previously urged residents to use wood and stoves for heating to reduce gas consumption. The region also faces electricity deficits amid a surge in the use of electronic heaters and gas shortages in power stations. The Dniester State District Power Plant, the region&apos;s largest power station, has switched to coal, though the authorities warned of possible risks of operating at full capacity due to the plant&apos;s obsolete equipment. Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-has-less-than-month-of-gas-left/	2025-01-08T22:49:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1411857866.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 803,100 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 803,100 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 9. This number includes 1,430 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,731 tanks, 20,221 armored fighting vehicles, 33,387 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,765 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,038 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,813 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-803-100-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-08T22:15:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166170923-1.jpg
Lithuania tightens security ahead of decoupling from Russian energy grid, Euronews reports	Lithuania has announced plans to enhance security measures around its power grids with Poland in preparation for next month&apos;s decoupling from the Russian energy system. The move marks a significant step in disconnecting from the Soviet-era grid shared with Russia and Belarus. Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said that the government had directed police forces to safeguard the electricity link with Warsaw, known as the LitPol Link. This decision comes amid concerns about potential sabotage following recent incidents in the Baltic Sea. &quot;We evaluate every possible version of sabotage, from cybersecurity to physical actions. Therefore, we deploy the Public Security Service because it has the most experience in protecting critical objects. They will replace private security services that have been protecting these objects,&quot; Paluckas said during a press conference on Jan. 8, according to Euronews. Last month, Lithuania&apos;s previous government increased security around the LitPol converter and transformer station near Alytus in southern Lithuania. A private security firm was initially contracted to protect the facility until spring, after which the Public Security Service will take over. Giedrimas Jeglinskas, Chairman of the Parliament&#x2019;s Committee on National Security and Defence, highlighted the risks in the Baltic Sea, where infrastructure damage and sabotage attempts have reportedly increased. &quot;Either it&#x2019;s intentional or unintentional, the number of these incidents will increase. The Baltic Sea is very peculiar, it&#x2019;s relatively shallow and cables are not that deep. Therefore, these incidents will repeat, because Russia is using the shadow fleet,&quot; Jeglinskas reportedly said. According to the office of the Lithuanian Prime Minister, there are &quot;clear and unambiguous attempts by opponents to disrupt&quot; the planned decoupling, though no further details were provided on the alleged threats or those responsible. Officials assured the public that Lithuania&#x2019;s energy reserves and contingency plans would prevent any power shortages. &quot;There is no scenario in which Lithuania would be left without electricity. We&apos;ve evaluated all scenarios, including operating without any interconnections. Those reserves have been assessed, and scenarios A, B, C, D and so on have been worked out. Perhaps the most important message that we want to communicate is the following: Despite any provocations that could occur, any incidents, the disconnection from BRELL [Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania] &#x2013; the Russian electricity grid &#x2013; is inevitable and will happen in exactly one month,&quot; said Arnoldas Pikzirnis, Lithuanian Vice Energy Minister. The Baltic states plan to disconnect from the Russian energy grid on Feb. 8. Following the decoupling, they aim to independently operate their national grids, which have undergone significant upgrades supported by 1.6 billion euros in European funding.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-tightens-security-ahead-of-decoupling-from-russian-energy-grid-euronews-reports/	2025-01-08T21:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1437356897.jpg
North Korea gains combat experience fighting in Ukraine, boosting regional threat, US warns	North Korea is gaining valuable combat experience from its troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, enhancing its ability to wage war against neighboring countries, a senior U.S. official said on Jan. 8. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has strengthened both diplomatic and military ties with Pyongyang. According to Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., over 12,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia and began engaging Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region last month. North Korea &quot;is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology, and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,&quot; Shea said during a U.N. Security Council meeting. The council convened to discuss Pyongyang&#x2019;s recent test of an intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile. &quot;In turn, the DPRK will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.&quot; North Korea&#x2019;s UN ambassador, Kim Song, defended Monday&apos;s missile test, describing it as part of efforts to strengthen the country&apos;s defense. He accused the United States of hypocrisy: &quot;When the civilian death toll exceeded 45,000 in Gaza, United States embellished Israel&#x2019;s nefarious mass killing atrocity as the right to self-defense&#x2026; Meanwhile, it takes issue with the legitimate exercise of the right to self-defense of the DPRK.&quot; Russia&apos;s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, repeated longstanding claims that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan provoke North Korea through military drills. He dismissed U.S. allegations of plans to share satellite and space technology with Pyongyang as &quot;wholly unsubstantiated.&quot; South Korea&#x2019;s UN ambassador, Joonkook Hwang, condemned North Korea&#x2019;s deployment of soldiers to Russia, describing them as &quot;essentially slaves to Kim Jong-un, brainwashed to sacrifice their lives on faraway battlefields to raise money for his regime and secure advanced military technology from Russia.&quot; North Korea has faced U.N. sanctions since 2006, aimed at halting its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. However, with Russia holding veto power in the Security Council, any additional measures are unlikely to advance.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-gains-combat-experience-fighting-in-ukraine-boosting-regional-threat-us-warns/	2025-01-08T20:12:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
NATO membership is Ukraine’s best security guarantee, Finland's FM tells Reuters	NATO membership is the only credible long-term guarantee Ukraine can secure to defend against future Russian aggression, Finland&apos;s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on Jan. 8. While Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming return to the White House on January 20 has sparked hope for a diplomatic resolution to Moscow&apos;s invasion, it has also raised concerns in Kyiv about a potential peace deal coming with steep concessions. President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized the need for robust security assurances from allies to prevent Russia from regrouping for another attack. &quot;In the long term, the only credible security guarantee is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty&#x2014;so NATO membership essentially,&quot; Valtonen said in an interview with Reuters during her visit to Kyiv, referencing the alliance&apos;s collective defense clause. &quot;And we are supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership further down the line and hopefully not in (the) too-distant future.&quot; Ukraine has strongly advocated for an invitation to join NATO, but resistance from key member states persists as the all-out war nears its three-year mark, with Ukrainian forces continuing to face challenges in pushing back Russian offensives. Trump, who has expressed skepticism about U.S. aid to Ukraine, said on Jan. 7 that he sympathizes with Russia&apos;s stance against Ukraine joining NATO. His aides and allies view Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership as a potential provocation toward Moscow. He also accused outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden of altering the U.S. position on Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO prospects. Despite these developments, Valtonen suggested that a Trump administration would not necessarily derail Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;Three years ago nobody thought that Finland would be joining NATO, or Sweden for that matter,&quot; she remarked. &quot;So here we are, you never know.&quot; Finland, which shares an 830-mile (1,336 km) border with Russia, joined NATO in 2023 following Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sweden became a member in early 2024. On the topic of defense spending, Trump also called for European NATO members to increase their defense budgets from 2% of GDP to 5%. Valtonen noted that Finland has been proactive in meeting its defense commitments and welcomed Trump&#x2019;s push for greater European contributions. &quot;We are very much on the same page with Trump on that, because I think we should do more, we can do more,&quot; she said. &quot;Certainly Europe has improved massively over the course of the past years, and will continue doing so.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-membership-is-ukraines-best-security-guarantee-finlands-fm-tells-reuters/	2025-01-08T18:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1250760048.jpg
Russia doesn't have as many advantages as it seems, US defense secretary says	Russia does not hold all the advantages in the full-scale war against Ukraine, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Jan. 8. Austin&apos;s comments come on the eve of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Jan. 9 meeting will be the last Ramstein summit before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. &quot;There&apos;s a thought that Russia has the ultimate hand here and it has every advantage,&quot; Austin told Bloomberg News. &quot;It has some advantages, but it doesn&apos;t completely dominate this equation here. And if it gets what it wants, it will cost them in the future.&quot; Austin said that Ukraine&apos;s strengths and Russia&apos;s challenges should affect potential peace negotiations, which Trump has promised to initiate after his inauguration. The push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military cannot currently retake all of it by force and has said that some regions, including Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. Even if Russia gains territory in a negotiated agreement, Austin said, continuing to occupy Ukrainian regions will drain Moscow&apos;s resources. &quot;Russia will have to invest a lot of land forces to hold it,&quot; he said. Austin also noted Russia&apos;s dependence on Iran and North Korea for assistance, including &quot;weapons and munitions and also now people.&quot; Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been dispatched to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, to fight alongside Russian troops against Ukrainian forces. The outgoing U.S. administration has said that it aims to bolster Ukraine&apos;s position in upcoming negotiations with an influx of military aid and efforts to shore up its international alliances. The UDCG summit on Jan. 9 will focus on supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities through the year 2027, according to the Pentagon. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the Ramstein Air Base on a regular basis to coordinate military support for Ukraine. Trump has not yet outlined his plans for the contact group, and some believe the next meeting may be its last. &#xA0; Ahead of his final Ramstein summit, Austin defended U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s strategy on Ukraine. &quot;What it did was it helped Ukraine survive, it helped Ukraine defend its sovereign territory,&quot; Austin said. &quot;The loss of 700,000 troops killed and wounded &#x2014; that would&apos;ve been beyond imagination three years ago,&quot; he said, referring to the heavy losses Russia has sustained over the course of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-doesnt-have-as-many-advantages-as-it-seems-us-defense-secretary-says/	2025-01-08T16:01:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Ukraine to help Moldova amid worsening energy crisis	Kyiv and Chisinau are working together to find solutions to the ongoing energy crisis in Moldova, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Moldovan President Maia Sandu announced on Jan. 8. The Russian state energy company Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, triggering widespread power outages and heating failures in the Russian-occupied Transnistria region. Zelensky and Sandu held a telephone conversation on Jan. 8 in which they discussed the energy crisis and Russia&apos;s role. &quot;An important task now is to help Moldova overcome its energy challenges and prevent Moscow from stirring up social tensions. ... We are ready to help,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. Zelensky said the current crisis represents &quot;an obvious attempt by Russia to manipulate energy resources against the Moldovan authorities.&quot; According to Sandu&apos;s press service, the two leaders are collaborating on &quot;common solutions&quot; to prevent the emergency from devolving further, including using alternative fuel sources, such as coal. The Moldovan government has accused Moscow of deliberately manufacturing the crisis in order to destabilize the country. Gazprom claims the decision to cut off gas supplies resulted from Moldova&apos;s unpaid debts, an allegation Chisinau disputes. An agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia ended gas deliveries to Moldova, but Gazprom maintains that the suspension was prompted by debts, not transit issues. Alternative routes for gas from Russia to Moldova are available. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, the breakaway Transnistria region &#x2014;&#xA0;occupied by Russian troops since the 1990s &#x2014; remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. The region&apos;s electricity system is now on the brink of collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-help-moldova-amid-worsening-energy-crisis/	2025-01-08T14:02:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zelensky.jpeg
Trump wants to end war in 100 days, incoming peace envoy tells Fox News	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine within 100 days of his inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, told Fox News on Jan. 8. The comments come a day after Trump said in a press conference that he would not launch peace talks until after his inauguration. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, pledged repeatedly during his campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected. &quot;This is a war that needs to end, and I think he can do it in the near term,&quot; Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News. Kellogg defined the &quot;near term&quot; as 100 days out from inauguration, and said it was his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution by that point. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; Kellogg praised Trump for his willingness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin was his &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; He said Trump would work to find a resolution satisfactory to both Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;I think they&apos;re going to come to a solvable solution in the near term. ... Let&apos;s set it at 100 days,&quot; he said. Kellogg did not discuss details of any potential peace agreements under consideration by the incoming administration. Kellogg, 80, previously held key roles as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under President Trump, and served as a senior advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. He was planning a visit to Kyiv, which has reportedly been postponed until after Trump&apos;s inauguration. In a press conference on Jan. 7, Trump blamed Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, saying U.S. support for Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join NATO triggered the war. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&apos;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-end-war-in-100-days-incoming-peace-envoy-tells-fox-news/	2025-01-08T13:14:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes Russian oil depot, command post; Moscow bombs civilians in Zaporizhzhia	Key developments on Jan. 8: Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian oil depot in Engels, Saratov Oblast, overnight on Jan. 8, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks. The operation, carried out jointly by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the Unmanned Systems Forces, and other units, targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase, the military said. The statement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported a drone attack in the area, with footage of the burning oil facility circulating on social media. The city of Engels lies around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time amid a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the city. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused. Busargin said that there were no injuries as a result of the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 11 Ukrainian attack drones were downed over Saratov Oblast. &quot;The depot&apos;s destruction creates significant logistical problems for Russian strategic aviation and reduces its ability to attack peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian facilities,&quot; the General Staff said. The Engels-2 base hosts the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, operating Tu-160 bombers, and the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment with the Tupolev Tu-95 MS planes. Russia uses these aircraft to launch mass strikes on Ukraine, often resulting in heavy damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces have previously launched drone strikes targeting the airbase itself. Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. The military said that Russia has seized the facility to coordinate attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilians, especially near Kurakhove. After weeks of heavy battles, Russia announced earlier this week it had fully captured Kurakhove. &quot;All necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians,&quot; the General Staff noted. Khartsyzk lies around 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the Russian-held Donetsk and has been occupied by Russia since the start of its war in 2014. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted. Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. Similar attacks were reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, killing 13 people and injuring 63, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack was conducted using two FAB-500 gliding bombs, National Police reported. The attack damaged apartment buildings, an industrial facility, and other infrastructure. A tram and a minibus carrying passengers were also hit, as reported by the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. Aftermath of Russian attack on industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8. (Governor Ivan Fedorov / Telegram)Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. The attack is part of a broader wave of Russian assaults across Ukraine. Regional authorities reported at least two civilian deaths and 13 injuries nationwide over the past day. Overnight, Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Air defenses intercepted 41 drones over nine oblasts. Of the remaining drones, 22 dummy drones were lost in Ukrainian airspace, three returned to Russia, and one flew to Belarus. President Volodymyr Zelensky called for caution in interpreting U.S. policy following President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments linking Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations to Russia&#x2019;s invasion during a Jan. 8 meeting with Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen. The Ukrainian president argued that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&#x2019;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump had criticized President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &#x2018;No, they should be able to join NATO.&#x2019; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky dismissed conclusions about NATO, referencing Ukraine&#x2019;s recent access to Patriot missile systems and other NATO-standard weapons. &quot;Do you remember when Ukraine was told that Patriot systems are only available to NATO countries? Either we have been in NATO for a long time, or we should not jump to conclusions,&quot; he said. Finnish foreign minister emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership poses no threat to other countries. &quot;This narrative is similar to the one Russia has long used, blaming NATO and its so-called &apos;enlargement&apos; for its own aggression,&quot; Valtonen said. Reports from The Wall Street Journal suggest Trump&#x2019;s team may propose delaying Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. While Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership remains a long-term goal, Zelensky reiterated the need for robust security guarantees in the immediate term. Ukrainian envoy Andrii Melnyk echoed this sentiment on Dec. 27, emphasizing that diplomatic efforts currently center on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities rather than immediate NATO accession. Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution to the war by 2025. The final military aid package from the Biden administration to Ukraine, amounting to $500 million, is set to be officially announced on Jan. 9, Voice of America correspondent Carla Babb reported on Jan. 8 from Ramstein Air Base. The package, drawn from the Pentagon&#x2019;s existing stockpile under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) program, is expected to be the last from the outgoing administration before President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Despite previous commitments to exhaust the remaining PDA funds, approximately $3.8 billion will remain unused, according to the Pentagon, leaving the funds at the disposal of the incoming administration. Trump and his team have been vocal critics of U.S. financial support for Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s incoming National Security Advisor, said on Dec. 15 that &quot;a blank check... just isn&#x2019;t a strategy.&quot; In a Jan. 5 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to work with the incoming U.S. administration. He proposed that Ukraine purchase U.S. weapons using $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. While Zelensky remains committed to pursuing a diplomatic resolution by 2025, the incoming Trump administration&#x2019;s approach to the conflict and its impact on military aid remains unclear. General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces chief, reported to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the roots of the problems facing the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and presented solutions, Drapatyi said on Jan. 8. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. &quot;Most of the systemic shortcomings were committed by the Ground Forces Command, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Operational Command,&quot; the commander wrote on social media. Drapatyi was appointed to lead the Ground Forces last November, months after the brigade was formed. Without revealing all the details before &quot;all the circumstances are established,&quot; Drapatyi acknowledged &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; within the unit. The commander said the biggest challenge was the &quot;low efficiency and motivation of mid-level commanders who directly manage people.&quot; Relevant solutions are already being implemented, with a focus on &quot;recruiting experienced officers and commanders at all levels,&quot; the general said, adding that the 155th Brigade&#x2019;s soldiers will receive additional training.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-supplying-fuel-to-engels-2-airbase-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-08T12:23:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwD6KeaUAAgJXL-1-1.png
Despite Trump's claims, Russia didn't invade Ukraine because of NATO	President-elect Donald Trump, on Jan. 7, blamed the outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden for Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said Biden&apos;s support of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership had led to Russia&apos;s war against the country. &quot;I could understand their feelings,&quot; he said, referring to the country that launched the deadliest war in Europe since World War II. Trump&apos;s statements were far from reality, with Biden never officially supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspiration and the White House being the main obstacle to Kyiv receiving a formal invite to join the alliance. &quot;It is possible that in two days, Trump will say something completely different, or Putin will make him angry because he will,&quot; Aaron Burnett, a senior fellow at the Democratic Strategy Initiative, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(Trump&apos;s statements) is just a word salad.&quot; During the Jan. 7 press conference, President-elect Trump was explicit in his desire to seek territorial expansion, not ruling out using military force against Panama and NATO ally Denmark, and using economic mechanisms to conquer Canada. Trump also said he understands the desire for Russia&apos;s territorial expansion, blaming his country for Russia&apos;s war. &quot;A big part of the problem is, Russia &#x2014; for many, many years, long before (Vladimir) Putin &#x2014; said, &apos;You could never have NATO involved with Ukraine.&apos; Now, they&apos;ve said that. That&apos;s been, like, written in stone,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And somewhere along the line, Biden said, &apos;No. They should be able to join NATO.&apos; Well, then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep, and I could understand their feelings about that.&quot; Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 when there were no talks about Ukraine joining NATO. The public opinion prior to Russia&apos;s invasion was also not in favor of joining the bloc. However, soon to be president, Trump, had long held unconventional views on NATO, its goals and the ways it works. U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak to the media at a press conference on the second day of the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on July 12, 2018. (Sean Gallup / Getty Images)During his presidential campaign, Trump caused concern among NATO members by saying he would not rule out the U.S. leaving the alliance. According to the president-elect, European countries are not contributing enough and &quot;should play fair.&quot; Trump&apos;s statement that he would allow Russia &quot;to do whatever it wanted&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria sparked even bigger outrage. &quot;No, I would not protect you,&quot; Trump said at a February rally in Conway, South Carolina. &quot;In fact, I would encourage them (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.&quot; For years, Trump demanded that NATO countries spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense, a target reached by 23 NATO countries out of 32 in 2024. All states that border Russia spend over 2 percent of their defense. As it frequently happens, on Jan. 7, Trump changed his desires, saying he wants NATO member states to spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense, a figure currently reached by zero NATO countries, including the U.S. Since collective defense against aggression is the foundation of NATO, the U.S. reneging on its commitments would collapse the alliance. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance told NBC News that Trump has no intention of withdrawing from NATO. Trump wants NATO countries to &quot;actually carry their share of the defense burden,&quot; Vance added. Meanwhile, the doors to Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO were never really opened, and now it looks like they are shutting completely. Since its independence, Ukraine made a number of attempts to join the alliance, seen as the only real guarantee for the country&apos;s security. In 2008, Ukraine sent an official application for a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP), which if approved, would set the road for the country to join the alliance once all the criteria would be met. U.S. President George Bush, a Republican, was a key supporter of Ukraine&apos;s desire to join the alliance. The main opponents of Ukraine&apos;s potential membership were Germany and France, and despite a U.S.-led push to persuade German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to welcome Kyiv, neither had budged. When the Democrats took the White House, the question of NATO membership for Ukraine was off the table, with neither President Barack Obama nor Biden supporting the Ukrainian aspiration. Under Ukraine&apos;s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who ruled the country between 2010 and 2014, the commission for preparing the country for NATO membership and the National Center for Euro-Atlantic Integration were dismantled. According to Ukrainian polls, before Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, slightly over 20 percent of the country&apos;s population supported joining NATO. Following Russia&apos;s occupation of Ukraine&apos;s Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, over 50 percent of Ukrainians said they would vote for NATO membership. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the number of Ukrainians supporting NATO membership jumped to over 80 percent. In September 2022, as Russian troops were occupying parts of five Ukrainian regions, Kyiv officially applied to join the alliance. The U.S., under Biden&apos;s leadership, didn&apos;t support Ukraine&apos;s request. &quot;It was Biden and (Olaf) Scholz primarily who were putting the brakes on any invitation for Ukraine to NATO during the Vilnius Summit, for example. When other countries, most notably Central and Eastern Europe, the U.K., and even France, to a certain extent, were far more in favor at that time,&quot; Burnett said. &quot;Trump&apos;s rhetoric has the effect of absolutely putting in complete misinformation and disinformation about this particular question and America&apos;s willingness to actually have Ukraine in NATO and invite Ukraine to NATO.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to NATO is not the reason for Russia&apos;s attack, Burnett said, adding that Putin has repeatedly hinted that he does not recognize Ukraine as a sovereign state.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)&quot;Putin invaded Ukraine because he doesn&apos;t see it as a state, he doesn&apos;t believe that it has the right to exist as a state, and he&apos;s a neo-imperialist.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 8 that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&apos;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. According to Burnett, Trump has also shown neo-imperialist views, especially given his recent controversial statements about turning Canada into &quot;the 51st U.S. state&quot; or &quot;buying&quot; Greenland. Trump does not believe in alliances or the liberal world order, Burnett added. The expert said several factors will influence Ukraine&apos;s future NATO bid. Trump&apos;s decision may be affected by Republicans who support Ukraine. Much will depend on Europe, how much its states are willing to spend on their defense, and whether Washington will be satisfied. Ukraine will bear a heavy burden, but eventually, it will be difficult to predict any scenario at this point. &quot;Trump is unpredictable,&quot; Burnett said. &quot;If anyone tells you they know what Trump&apos;s going to do, they are lying.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-trumps-claims-russia-didnt-invade-ukraine-because-of-nato/	2025-01-08T12:10:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192846806.jpg

Hungary's FM condemns Ukraine’s bill to suspend Russian energy transit, says his country will block Kyiv's EU accession	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned a Ukrainian parliamentary bill proposing the suspension of Russian oil and gas transit through Ukraine during martial law, calling the measure &quot;unacceptable&quot; in a Facebook post on Jan. 8. &quot;The reality is that in the EU, member states collectively and unanimously decide on the admission of new members. In other words, each member state has to vote in favor,&quot; Szijjarto said, emphasizing Hungary&apos;s influence over Ukraine&#x2019;s EU aspirations. The bill, submitted on Jan. 7 by ex-President Petro Poroshenko and members of the opposition European Solidarity party, would ban Russian energy transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukraine had already decided not to renew its gas transit deal with Russia beyond Dec. 31, 2024, but continues to allow Russian oil transit via the Druzhba pipeline under a contract valid until the end of 2029. Szijjarto argued that Ukraine has obligations under its EU association agreement to support the bloc&apos;s energy security by maintaining transportation routes. &quot;Each state has the sovereign right to decide from where and how it buys the energy resources it needs to function, and no one has the right to impose more expensive energy resources on another country,&quot; he said. Hungary, along with Slovakia and Austria, remains heavily reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions. Szijjarto claimed that closing energy routes would harm Hungary and violate EU expectations for Ukraine&#x2019;s integration. On Jan. 7, Szijjarto also accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&#x2019;s economic challenges by halting the transit, allegedly leading to a rise in gas prices on the EU market. Hungary has repeatedly drawn criticism for its Moscow-friendly stance, including blocking sanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine. Szijjarto, who continues to visit Russia during the war, has set Hungary apart from other EU nations in its approach to the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-condemns-ukraines-bill-on-halting-russian-energy-transit-emphasizes-veto-over-eu-membership-decisions/	2025-01-08T10:51:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252632914.jpg
Garry Kasparov: 'You never hear Russian opposition actually say Ukraine must win'	The Russian opposition is an odd bunch. While not supporting Russia&apos;s brutal all-out war against Ukraine and its people, the leaders of the so-called opposition don&apos;t want their country to lose. A number of those who oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime have petitioned for the West to lift sanctions imposed on Russia for the war it had begun and the war crimes it had committed. Garry Kasparov, Russian chess grandmaster and political activist, is not among them. Supporting Ukraine militarily and making sure it wins is a moral imperative, says Kasparov. A staunch critic of authoritarianism, Kasparov wrote about the dangers posed by Putin&apos;s rule for years. His 2015 book, &quot;Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped,&quot; outlined Russia&apos;s political threat to global security. Over the past three years, Kasparov has repeatedly argued that any chance at Russia becoming a democratic country not only requires its total military defeat but a shedding of its imperialistic legacy &#x2014; a stance not widely embraced by other Russian opposition figures. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Kasparov shared his thoughts on the current state of the Russian opposition, why they&apos;re looking for a &quot;good tsar&quot; to replace Putin, and why he&apos;ll push back at those who insist it&apos;s &quot;Putin&apos;s war&quot; rather than Russia&apos;s war. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Living in the West, you&apos;re well-placed to comment on its perceptions of Russia. There are these centuries-old ideas like the &quot;Russian soul&quot; or the warning not to &quot;poke the Russian bear.&quot; Do you think the enduring popularity of these ideas has contributed to both the West&apos;s fear of Russian escalation but also this misplaced compassion for Russians as some tortured souls who are just misunderstood? Garry Kasparov: You know, I think it&apos;s a matter of looking for a black cat in a dark room &#x2014; something that is simply not there. That&apos;s the crux of the problem. I remember, back when I was younger, my friend Yury Afanasyev, a brilliant historian, said that Russian literature was one of the most fertile sources of Russian nationalism. At the time, I instinctively disagreed. But now I see he was right. American exceptionalism is rooted in tangible concepts like living standards, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. Russian exceptionalism, on the other hand, leans more toward the mystical. It&apos;s tied to the notion that being Russian means having a special connection to a higher power. However, Russian history provides no evidence of such a unique connection. We need to delve deeply and understand, on a fundamental level, why the idea of the &quot;Russian soul&quot; remains so resistant to external influences. The war in Ukraine has shown us that when we celebrated the fall of communism in 1991, we failed to grasp that communism was merely a facade for an underlying imperialist matrix. Whether it&apos;s the tsars, the Bolsheviks, or Putin, this imperialism always finds a way to emerge. I&apos;ve been saying for the past three years that there&apos;s only one way to dismantle this imperial matrix: the Ukrainian flag has to fly over Sevastopol again. As long as the idea of Russia&apos;s messianic mission endures, nothing will truly change. You need to shatter it with a visual shock. This is likely the best &#x2014; perhaps the only &#x2014; way to give Russia a chance to reform itself into a normal nation-state in the true sense of the word. The Kyiv Independent: One might say that living abroad can deepen or distance one&apos;s understanding of their home country. How has it been for you and the way you look at Russia? Garry Kasparov: Undoubtedly, when you step away, you lose a certain connection to things on the ground. Some things are no longer tied to your immediate senses. However, if you want to analyze the bigger picture, distance can be helpful because you&apos;re no longer caught up in the daily routine. From afar, you gain a sense of objectivity. After all, why do you need to be on the inside to understand what&apos;s happening &#x2014; especially when you&apos;ve been predicting it for so long? My first warning about Vladimir Putin and the potential dangers he posed came on Jan. 4, 2001, in a piece I wrote for The Wall Street Journal. When he began attacking free media and television, I immediately recognized the signs &#x2014; his statements like &quot;once KGB, always KGB,&quot; and actions like restoring the conservative Soviet anthem. The writing was on the wall. On April 25, 2005, during his State of the Nation address, he declared that &quot;the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.&quot; That statement was the defining moment. It was a clear declaration of intent to rebuild the Russian Empire &#x2014; not necessarily within the same borders, but rather a return to the kind of world where the underlying principle is that &quot;might makes right.&quot; This is the world Putin understands. What&apos;s tragic is that even now, after so much blood has been spilled, there are still people in the free world trying to find some kind of compromise or middle ground to return to. What they fail to recognize is that you cannot negotiate with this kind of evil for a simple reason: Putin views this as a war of destruction, not a war for territorial gains. Giving him a piece of Ukrainian territory won&apos;t change his calculations &#x2014; it will only whet his appetite. His ultimate goal includes the destruction of Ukrainian statehood because Ukrainian statehood is one of the pillars of this world order he seeks to dismantle.

(Contributor / Getty Images)When you examine the attitudes of politicians in the West &#x2014; in Germany, Britain, or America &#x2014; it&apos;s striking. Even after (the occupation of) Crimea, after countless wars, after Syria, many still fail to grasp the situation. Looking at the world&apos;s conflicts today, you see Putin as a spider at the center of the web. Yet, there remains a persistent tendency among many Western politicians to seek common ground, negotiate, and find ways to avoid the magic word &#x2014; escalation. This approach is utterly misguided because the surest way to escalate is to show weakness. Everyone knows that when facing a predator, you must hold your ground and look it in the eye. If you turn your back, you&apos;re done for. The Kyiv Independent: With increasing discussions about the possibility of negotiations and freezing conflict lines even among Ukrainian officials, the prospect of the Ukrainian flag flying over Sevastopol again, unfortunately, seems distant. Do you think the lack of a decisive military defeat could further radicalize pro-war sentiments in Russia? Garry Kasparov: I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a strong pro-war sentiment in Russia. Instead, it&apos;s more about accepting the war as inevitable. There&apos;s very little opposition to it &#x2014; let&apos;s be honest. At its peak, perhaps 15 percent of people opposed the war on moral grounds. I&apos;m skeptical of any numbers coming from Putin&apos;s Russia, but the so-called Crimean consensus &#x2014; 86 percent in favor &#x2014; likely reflects the true mindset. In the early days of the full-scale invasion, I don&apos;t think more than 10 percent of the population opposed the war on moral grounds, which still amounts to 15 to 20 million people. Those who wholeheartedly supported the war were a smaller group, likely a surge of fervent supporters. The rest were more conformist, going along with it because the war brought some material benefits. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s the same fanatical belief in the cause as there was in Nazi Germany or Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union because there&apos;s no real future in this for most people. But there&apos;s compliance because there&apos;s not much else to do. If you look at the living standards in Russia, the full-scale invasion has actually acted like a drug, inflating everything, including people&apos;s earnings. While it may not last, it created a kind of new consensus in society. Putin managed to avoid massive mobilization from big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, drawing most soldiers from the countryside, poor regions, and prisons. So far, the war hasn&apos;t had the same impact on society as mass mobilization would have, nor has it caused body bags to arrive in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Remains of Russian soldiers are found in the Bakhmut battle zone, in Sloviansk, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on June 29, 2024.

(Libkos/Getty Images)I see no evidence that any potential deal could be made. And while I&apos;m not in favor of a deal, that&apos;s not my decision. I understand that the Ukrainian leadership must deal with reality. We also have to acknowledge that the cowardly stance of the free world has left Ukraine with very few options on the table. It&apos;s a shame that all the weapons developed and manufactured in America &#x2014; specifically to fight Russia &#x2014; are still collecting dust in storage or sitting unused in the deserts of California and Nevada. The NATO alliance, which was created for the sole purpose of stopping Russian aggression in Europe, is now debating whether Ukraine belongs in it. Ukraine is the only country that has fought and is still fighting for NATO&apos;s core mission &#x2014; not sending troops to Afghanistan or Iraq but preventing a Russian invasion. While the idea of the Ukrainian flag flying over Sevastopol may take longer than we all hope, I still believe that without a decisive military defeat, there won&apos;t be substantial change in Russia. The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think some opposition figures &#x2014; such as Ilya Yashin, Yulia Navalnaya, and her late husband, Alexei Navalny &#x2014; often frame their arguments to the Russian public against Russian aggression in economic terms rather than moral ones? Garry Kasparov: Because they live within this paradigm of good Putin, bad Putin, good Tsar, bad Tsar, with no real interest in eliminating the imperial nature of the Russian state. This is the fundamental difference. When people talk about the Russian opposition, I ask: opposition to what? Reducing everything to Putin and his entourage is historically wrong because the true foundation of Russian aggression is the Russian Empire itself &#x2014; its imperial mindset. You can talk about corruption, but in a way, it actually helped Ukraine. Without it, the Russian army could have been much stronger. Thanks to the corruption of Russian generals, who stole probably half of the military budget, Ukraine has had a better chance of survival. Ultimately, the whole idea of continuing to expose corruption is irrelevant &#x2014; corruption makes Putin weaker, not stronger. Many of them dream of the day they can return to Russia, campaign, and address Russian voters. But if they see themselves doing that, they think they need to say, &quot;We never took the other side, even when our country was wrong; we tried to stay neutral.&quot; Honestly, that&apos;s a moral dilemma I don&apos;t understand. For me, it&apos;s clear: we&apos;re fighting Putin, Putin&apos;s fascism, and everything connected to him. At the core of it all is this imperial matrix, and we have to win the war. The Ukrainian army is the only force fighting against it. So, helping Ukraine and supporting the army with all available means is the right decision. That&apos;s the only moral position &#x2014; it&apos;s really that simple. Ukraine&apos;s victory must include a full restoration of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It must also include reparations to be paid. Russia must pay for this. It is crucial to punish war criminals, whether that happens in The Hague, in Russia, or by whatever international tribunal, and there should be no compromise on this. Someone might hear this and think, &quot;Why don&apos;t you (and other members of the Russian opposition) just find common ground? Why don&apos;t you work together?&quot; I&apos;m happy to work together, as long as we see the world through the same lens. Yes, we can argue about many things, but when it comes to fundamental moral issues &#x2014; matters of life and death &#x2014; that&apos;s what truly matters.

(Axel Schmidt/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that&apos;s why they insist on calling it &quot;Putin&apos;s war&quot; rather than Russia&apos;s war? Garry Kasparov: Absolutely, that&apos;s the point. As I&apos;ve mentioned elsewhere, it&apos;s not about whether Putin personally killed someone &#x2014; he probably did early on in his career &#x2014; but he gives orders, and those orders are executed. I haven&apos;t heard of mass desertion in the Russian military, just some desertion, but not on a large scale. These are orders being carried out, and many acts of cruelty show this isn&apos;t just about Putin; it&apos;s a mentality. Ignoring this and claiming it&apos;s all Putin&apos;s doing is an attempt to distort the truth. It&apos;s not politics, and to suggest otherwise is morally wrong. As much as I don&apos;t want to argue, if people continue to say this is Putin&apos;s war, I will push back, rejecting that notion as absolutely inconceivable. It&apos;s simply ignoring reality. I&apos;m happy to debate when there are many unknowns, but no one knows better than those fighting on the Russian side that they plan to destroy Ukraine. They are attacking kindergartens and hospitals &#x2014; they know exactly what they&apos;re doing when they press the button to launch missile and drone attacks. Who presses that button? It&apos;s not just Putin. The Kyiv Independent: In retrospect, what was the Russian opposition&apos;s greatest failure leading to 2022? Garry Kasparov: The last moment the Russian opposition had a chance to change things was back in 2011-2012 after Putin returned to power. Unfortunately, we couldn&apos;t generate enough momentum with the protests on the streets of Moscow. It was over after that. Over the next decade, it became clear that the system was fake. You could have participated in some elections, but they were absolutely meaningless. What did those elections accomplish? I had several debates with (members of the Russian opposition) about this. My point was simple: if you find yourself in a bad position, like in chess, it doesn&apos;t mean you have to make a bad move. Many young people were misled by the claims that they only needed to go out and protest. But what was the goal? Putin was firmly in power, and these opposition activities, without clear goals, couldn&apos;t change anything inside the country. They only created the wrong image in the free world. While in exile, I&apos;ve met with top politicians and given interviews. Whenever I spoke out about this, people would say, &quot;Mr. Kasparov, you&apos;re a great chess player, but we&apos;re talking about Russia, not the Soviet Union. You have Navalny, you have others.&quot; But by saying so, they were essentially helping Putin build his war machine and providing cover for him. A good example was back in 2018 or 2019, just before COVID. The question arose about restoring Russia&apos;s membership in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights. I wrote an open letter to Heiko Maas, then Germany&apos;s Foreign Affairs Minister, saying it was absolutely immoral. Russia had violated every provision of that organization &#x2014; every rule. They were occupying Ukraine&apos;s sovereign land, just as they had done with Georgia. He, of course, never responded to me directly, but there was an indirect response. He gave another interview, saying, &quot;Yes, we&apos;ve heard some pushback,&quot; without naming me. He also mentioned having a letter from 39 human rights organizations in Russia supporting the restoration of Russia&apos;s membership in the Strasbourg Human Rights Court. Meanwhile, some organizations are pretending that they&apos;re operating in Russia. It&apos;s clear that it&apos;s about funding. Millions of dollars are still being wasted on these fake activities in Russia by organizations that never did anything useful there. Now, in exile, they continue pretending. They claim they must protect their people, but I say stop this nonsense. Nothing is happening in Russia. These people pretend they&apos;re making a difference. They speak about demonstrations and say they&apos;re against the war, but that&apos;s not enough.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)We must support Ukraine&apos;s victory in this war. You never hear them say Ukraine must win. It&apos;s always about stopping the war, but at this point, maybe even Putin wants to stop it for his own reasons. There is no common ground between us. This is unfortunate because it creates bad optics, but the reality is that most of the Russian opposition, or those who believe they are opposition, don&apos;t realize that it&apos;s not enough. They still hold on to the idea of a &quot;good Putin&quot; alternative, essentially wanting to replace the bad Putin with a &quot;good Tsar.&quot; The Kyiv Independent: Given the current state of the Russian opposition, particularly with so many figures now in exile, what do you believe is the most effective approach to challenging Putin&apos;s regime and supporting Russia&apos;s future? Garry Kasparov: Well, I&apos;d like to ask again &#x2014; what opposition? This so-called opposition has failed to make meaningful change, and I don&apos;t see how anything can be done at this point except supporting Ukraine in winning the war. Right now, it&apos;s about surviving this onslaught and winning. This illustrates the key differences in our approaches. From the very beginning of the full-scale invasion, I proposed an idea later supported by Mikhail Khodorkovsky: we should offer every Russian who opposes the war and wants to leave the country the chance to do so after signing a declaration. We worked out the Berlin Declaration, which was a mild statement compared to the Free Russia Forum Council&apos;s format, but it contained three key points: the war is criminal, the regime is illegitimate, and Crimea is Ukraine. It&apos;s a simple test &#x2014; if someone is willing to sign it, we need to find a way for them to leave the country, obtain a visa, and find a place in the free world. There are several important aspects to this plan. One is that it can impact the intellectual class in Russia &#x2014; people involved in finance, business, IT, and engineering, including those who could possess the kind of knowledge that would have them working on the development of missiles. I&apos;m not offering a moral defense for them, but before criticizing anyone, we need to give them a chance to leave. So far, Putin has gained a significant ideological advantage because these people see that the world doesn&apos;t want them. As a result, hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Russians &#x2014; crucial to Putin&apos;s war machine &#x2014; remain in Russia. Without them, Putin&apos;s economy, especially his war economy, would collapse. This was the plan, but strangely, many of our colleagues in the opposition were not happy. They argued that we can&apos;t let people leave because who will protest against Putin? But I don&apos;t see people needing to stay just to protest. We could help these people leave, work with them, and build what I call &quot;Russian Taiwan&quot; &#x2014; a network of the future free Russia. When the moment comes, and the regime collapses, those who want to return can come back, and they would be the new ruling elite. But the opposition rejected this idea. For example, did you ever hear Yulia Navalnaya talk about something along those lines? She has met with many prime ministers and presidents but never mentioned anything like it. Instead, they all rejected the idea because, in their view, it wasn&apos;t a good one. That&apos;s exactly what Putin needs &#x2014; people to stay and oppose the idea of leaving. So, if someone calls themselves a member of the Russian opposition, tell me, what is your goal? I know what our goal is. The Free Russia Forum, which I co-founded, believes that Ukraine must win &#x2014; that is our only chance. We must work toward Ukraine&apos;s victory and create momentum for Russia&apos;s defeat. Only then can we begin to consider what comes next.	https://kyivindependent.com/garry-kasparov-without-decisive-military-defeat-there-wont-be-change-in-russia/	2025-01-08T10:30:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2071877887.jpg
Zelensky addresses Trump’s comments on NATO, stresses security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky called for caution in interpreting U.S. policy following President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments linking Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations to Russia&#x2019;s invasion, during a Jan. 8 meeting with Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen. The Ukrainian president argued that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&#x2019;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump had criticized President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &#x2018;No, they should be able to join NATO.&#x2019; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky dismissed conclusions about NATO, referencing Ukraine&#x2019;s recent access to Patriot missile systems and other NATO-standard weapons. &quot;Do you remember when Ukraine was told that Patriot systems are only available to NATO countries? Either we have been in NATO for a long time, or we should not jump to conclusions,&quot; he said. Finnish foreign minister emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership poses no threat to other countries. &quot;This narrative is similar to the one Russia has long used, blaming NATO and its so-called &apos;enlargement&apos; for its own aggression,&quot; Valtonen said. Reports from The Wall Street Journal suggest Trump&#x2019;s team may propose delaying Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. While Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership remains a long-term goal, Zelensky reiterated the need for robust security guarantees in the immediate term. Ukrainian envoy Andrii Melnyk echoed this sentiment on Dec. 27, emphasizing that diplomatic efforts currently center on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities rather than immediate NATO accession. Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution to the war by 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-trumps-comments-on-nato-stresses-security-guarantees/	2025-01-08T10:20:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
As Russian losses in Ukraine mount, Putin faces ‘devastating’ demographic timebomb	Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts have told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&#x201D; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &#x201C;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&#x201D; According to Ukrainian figures, on Jan. 7, Russian losses passed another grim milestone, surpassing 800,000. The figures from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces do not specify killed or wounded. The overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. According to Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, more than half of these losses &#x2014; 427,000 &#x2014; occurred during 2024, accelerating as the year progressed with no sign of slowing. The bodies of killed Russian soldiers in the Bakhmut area in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. June 29, 2024 (Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian forces suffered their deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion on Dec. 19, taking 2,200 casualties. For comparison, the U.K. suffered 750,000 military casualties during the six years of World War II. Ukraine has published daily estimates of the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers since the early days of the full-scale invasion. Initially, there was some skepticism about how accurate the numbers were, but as Ukraine&apos;s Western allies began to publicly release their own estimates of Russian losses, they have been broadly in line with those coming out of Kyiv. Compounding the staggering losses sustained during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine is the fact Russia was already facing severe demographic issues before it launched the full-scale war. &#x201C;The Russian Federation was trapped long before its invasion of Ukraine in what I described as a demographic straitjacket,&#x201D; Nicholas Eberstadt, who holds the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told the Kyiv Independent. Eberstadt says that in terms of many indicators such as urbanization, education attainment levels, and family formation patters, Russia presents as a &#x201C;typical European country.&#x201D; &#x201C;What&apos;s not at all typical European is the very low level of human capital that we see in Russian Federation,&#x201D; he says.

(Rostislav Netisov / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;Life expectancy for young men is on par with a fourth-world country. Life expectancy at age 15 for a Russian man right before the (COVID-19) pandemic was about the same as his counterpart in Haiti.&#x201D; A large study into why Russian males had such short life expectancies published in 2014 concluded one of the main factors in early deaths was excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors cited in a more recent investigation last year by the independent Russian media outlet Cherta, included high rates of murder, suicide, car crashes, and other fatal accidents. On top of this, Russia has long-faced a decline in birth rates which Eberstadt says started to go down after 2015. &#x201C;Demographers look at what they call a total fertility rate (TFR) which is births per women,&#x201D; Eberstadt says, adding: &#x201C;You need basically 2.1 in most countries to maintain your population.&#x201D; According to figures from the World Bank, Russia&#x2019;s TFR was last at 2.1 in 1988. After declining steadily it began to rise again after 2000, but only reached a peak of around 1.8 in 2015, before falling again to 1.4 by 2022. Recognizing the impending demographic timebomb, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone to great lengths to encourage his people to have more babies. Some of the efforts from the Kremlin have been relatively benign, with Putin simply calling on women to get pregnant for the sake of the country. &#x201C;If we want to survive as an ethnic group &#x2014; well, or as ethnic groups inhabiting Russia &#x2014; there must be at least two children (per family),&quot; he said in a speech in February last year. Other efforts, such as a crackdown on access to abortions, have been far more insidious. Yet even with these efforts, the Kremlin only hopes to reach a TFR of 1.8 by 2036, far below the 2.1 needed to sustain the Russian population, estimated to be around 146 million currently.

(Yuri Kadobnov / AFP via Getty Images)And one of the biggest obstacles to achieving this goal is the war in Ukraine, though it&#x2019;s more complicated than simply having fewer men around to father children. &#x201C;The number of dead soldiers, especially given how many of them are 40 to 60-years-old, is not the crucial thing here,&#x201D; Balzer says, adding: &#x201C;The crucial thing is what it&apos;s doing to Russian society.&#x201D; Balzar points to the soaring rates of PTSD and alcohol and drug addiction among Russian soldiers returning home, as well as an increase in murder and violent crime incidents involving veterans. &#x201C;That&apos;s an environment where people are anxious to have more children,&#x201D; Balzer says. Declining populations and low TFRs are not problems faced only by Russia &#x2014; many developed nations currently have TFRs below 2.1, including the U.S. (1.7) and the U.K. (1.6). &#x201C;The whole world is facing what might be a 25% decline in population by the end of the century, but Russia is going to be a lot worse,&#x201D; Balzer says. &#x201C;Some demographers are suggesting that Russia&apos;s population in 2100 will be half of what it is today.&#x201D; &#x201C;It doesn&apos;t have to be, but if Putin wants to keep fighting this war, it is going to make it a lot worse.&#x201D; Aside from declining birth rates, there&#x2019;s also what Eberstadt refers to as the &#x201C;Russian paradox.&#x201D; While the populations of developed nations, even while in decline numerically, continue to innovate and contribute to the fields of science, technology, and general progress, Russia remains somewhat of a backwater despite having relatively high levels of education. &#x201C;There&apos;s a huge pool of talent in (Russia), really impressive talent,&#x201D; Eberstadt says. &#x201C;What&apos;s mysterious, if not bizarre, is how little of that talent nowadays translates into productive knowledge or into economic wealth.&#x201D; Faced with half the current population, Russia will struggle even more to be what Balzer referred to as a &#x201C;viable country.&#x201D; Although the future looks bleak for Russia, any negative effects of an impending demographic crisis are unlikely to occur soon enough to stop its ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;If Putin is all out&#x2026; &#xA0;then he doesn&apos;t really care (about the demographic crisis),&#x201D; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Putin&apos;s willing to sacrifice absolutely everything for the front.&#x201D; &#x201C;And it seems to me that they have just about enough troops and volunteers and others to keep the fight going. It&apos;s not about absolute numbers, it&apos;s about relative numbers, and at the same time, Ukraine is suffering its own problems,&#x201D; he adds.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Ukraine also faces its own demographic crisis, albeit one largely forced upon it by Russia. Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia first invaded in 2014 and fell to an estimated 37 million by January 2024. &#x201C;It&apos;s a race to the bottom,&#x201D; Foreman says, adding: &#x201C;It&apos;s basically which side can stay in the longest.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-ukraine-fuelling-devastating-demographic-timebomb-experts-say/	2025-01-08T09:38:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Finland to host NATO Baltic summit, address Russia’s 'shadow fleet' sabotage threats	Finland will host a summit for NATO member states with access to the Baltic Sea on Jan. 14 to address regional security threats, including the suspected Russian sabotage, the Finnish president&apos;s office announced on Jan. 8. The meeting, co-organized by Finland and Estonia, will focus on enhancing NATO&apos;s presence in the Baltic Sea and responding to risks posed by Russia&#x2019;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers allegedly used for sanction evasion and espionage. The summit follows recent damage to Baltic Sea infrastructure, with four telecommunication cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Finnish authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of involvement in the sabotage. &quot;The topic of the summit will be the security of the Baltic Sea region, especially measures required to secure the critical underwater infrastructure,&quot; the statement reads. Attendees will include NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, leaders from Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen. NATO has deployed up to 10 vessels to guard undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea until April, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported. The alliance is also bolstering its military presence to enhance situational awareness and deter potential threats. The alliance has prioritized protecting critical undersea infrastructure since May, with its Maritime Center for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure leading efforts to counter growing Russian sabotage activities. Denmark recently reported two Russian-registered vessels operating suspiciously near Sweden and Denmark. Concerns over Russian sabotage have increased since Western nations began supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022.

Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia industrial site kills 1, injures at least 30	Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, killing one person and injuring at least 30, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Fedorov did not specify the type of weaponry used in the attack but confirmed that the injured were transported to hospitals. &quot;Seven medical teams, police, and emergency services are working at the site of the strike,&quot; he said.

(Governor Ivan Fedorov / Telegram)Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. The attack is part of a broader wave of Russian assaults across Ukraine. Regional authorities reported at least two civilian deaths and 13 injuries nationwide over the past day. Overnight, Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Air defenses intercepted 41 drones over nine oblasts. Of the remaining drones, 22 dummy drones were lost in Ukrainian airspace, three returned to Russia, and one flew to Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-zaporizhzhia-industrial-site-kills-1-injures-at-least-30/	2025-01-08T07:33:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_15-51-48.jpg
Garry Kasparov on modern Russian empire	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan discusses with Garry Kasparov, Russian chess grandmaster and political activist based in the U.S., the current state of Russia, its continued pursuit of empire and the failures of the Russian opposition to create meaningful change.	https://kyivindependent.com/garry-kasparov-on-modern-russian-empire/	2025-01-08T07:10:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Kasparov-2_2.jpg
Next Ramstein meeting may be its last, Polish defense minister says	Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz announced on Jan. 8 his participation in the upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting on Jan. 9, hinting that it could be the group&apos;s last meeting in the current format. Kosiniak-Kamysz said the format might change after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has signalled his intention to break with the current U.S. strategy concerning Ukraine. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. &quot;I believe NATO should take on a greater burden,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz said, citing its expanded role in activities such as defending Polish Rzesz&#xF3;w&#x2013;Jasionka Airport, a key logistics hub for resupplying Ukraine. The Jan. 9 meeting will focus on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities through 2027, including air force, armor, artillery, drone, de-mining, missile defense, and maritime security needs, according to a Pentagon statement on Jan. 7. Kosiniak-Kamysz praised U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the architect of the Ramstein format, for his steadfast support of Poland, U.S. troop presence in the country, and aid to Ukraine. &quot;This (Ramstein) format is broader than NATO, and its success is thanks to Austin&#x2019;s leadership,&quot; he said. NATO has already begun transitioning to greater involvement, with member states agreeing in June to pass partial control of weapons supply coordination to Kyiv &#x2014; a move aimed at ensuring continuity under shifting U.S. leadership, according to Politico. Trump&#x2019;s plans for the UDCG remain unclear, though his comments blaming President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations have stirred debate. The incoming administration has yet to provide a detailed framework for its proposed ceasefire negotiations or changes to military aid programs. The Jan. 9 meeting will serve as a pivotal moment for international efforts to sustain Ukraine&apos;s defense amid uncertainty over U.S. policy shifts.	https://kyivindependent.com/greater-burden-poland-calls-for-natos-greater-role-as-ramstein-meeting-may-be-last-under-current-format-defmin-says/	2025-01-08T06:58:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2079424446.jpg
Polish consulate in St. Petersburg closes after over 50 years	Poland&#x2019;s consulate in the Russian city of St. Petersburg has shut down, with the staff taking down the Polish and EU flags and clearing out the building, the Polish RMF24 news outlet reported on Jan. 8. Poland closed its consulate building in St. Petersburg after 53 years. The decision follows Warsaw&apos;s order to close a Russian consulate in the Polish city of Poznan last year after accusing Moscow of sabotage plots. &quot;The ceremony took place in a very dignified manner,&quot; said Polish Ambassador to Russia Krzysztof Krajewski who was in attendance. &quot;The move has been underway for some time now.&quot; Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, providing weapons and taking in as many as 1 million refugees. Recently, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski called for a &quot;fair peace&quot; for Ukraine in a speech delivered to French diplomats in Paris, following French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s remarks that Ukraine should prepare for &quot;realistic&quot; discussions on territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-consulate-in-st-petersburg-closes-after-50-years/	2025-01-08T06:11:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192359114--1-.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast, military reports	Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. The military said that Russia has seized the facility to coordinate attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilians, especially in Kurakhove. After weeks of heavy battles, Russia announced earlier this week it had fully captured Kurakhove. &quot;All necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians,&quot; the General Staff noted. Khartsyzk lies around 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the Russian-held Donetsk and has been occupied by Russia since the start of its aggression in 2014. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted. Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. Similar attacks were reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast-military-reports/	2025-01-08T05:52:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
Ground Forces chief reports to Zelensky on 155th Brigade, names those responsible for 'systematic shortcomings'	General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces chief, reported to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the roots of the problems facing the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and presented solutions, Drapatyi said on Jan. 8. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. &quot;Most of the systemic shortcomings were committed by the Ground Forces Command, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Operational Command,&quot; the commander wrote on social media. Drapatyi was appointed to lead the Ground Forces last November, months after the brigade was formed. Without revealing all the details before &quot;all the circumstances are established,&quot; Drapatyi acknowledged &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; within the unit. The commander said the biggest challenge was the &quot;low efficiency and motivation of mid-level commanders who directly manage people.&quot; Relevant solutions are already being implemented, with a focus on &quot;recruiting experienced officers and commanders at all levels,&quot; the general said, adding that the 155th Brigade&#x2019;s soldiers will receive additional training. Service members of the unit will also be provided a hotline, the commander said. &quot;In addition to the official daily reports, I want to have direct contact and hear from the soldiers&#x2026; how our decisions affect their motivation and the real state of affairs,&quot; he added. According to the general, the brigade also received psychologists to strengthen its cohesion while holding positions near Pokrovsk. &quot;The French side has fully fulfilled its obligations to Ukraine,&quot; he stressed. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, pointed to problems in the brigade&apos;s creation and management, allegedly leading to 1,700 cases of soldiers going AWOL from the unit before firing a shot.	https://kyivindependent.com/ground-forces-chief-reports-to-zelensky-on-155th-brigade-names-those-responsible-for-systematic-shortcomings/	2025-01-08T05:25:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg
NATO reportedly sending ships to guard cables under Baltic Sea	A fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April, the Finnish broadcaster Yle reported on Jan. 7 after several cables were cut in suspected sabotage. The ships, mainly from Finland and Estonia, will patrol the Gulf of Finland, Yle reported. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. In a separate initiative, the U.K-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has set up a tracking system to alert allies if a ship poses a threat to undersea cable infrastructure. NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-reportedly-sending-ships-to-guard-cables/	2025-01-08T04:27:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-471415136.jpg
Photos of jailed Belarusian opposition leader appear after almost 2 years of no news	Photos and a video of Viktar Babaryka were published by blogger Raman Pratasevich on Jan. 8 after the jailed Belarusian opposition leader was held incommunicado since February 2023. The footage was released weeks after Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 political prisoners in an apparent goodwill gesture ahead of the presidential election on Jan. 26. Lukashenko has ruled the country since 1994, cementing his power through widespread repressions, secret police, and electoral fraud. The dictator claimed victory in the last 2020 election after rigging the vote and violently suppressing the subsequent protests and is expected to secure his seventh term later this month. Photos of Babaryka and an excerpt from his video appeal to relatives have been published on the Telegram channel of Pratasevich, formerly a dissident and editor-in-chief of the opposition news channel Nexta who became a regime apologist after his arrest in 2021 and subsequent pardon. The pictures show the opposition leader dressed in black clothes, with a yellow sign designating him as &quot;prone to extremist activities,&quot; writing something on paper. According to the Viasna human rights group, Babaryka has not been seen since Feb. 5, 2023. Pratasevich said he had passed letters between Babaryka and his family members. Babaryka intended to run for the 2020 presidential election but was rejected and, in 2021, sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges of bribery and tax evasion broadly seen as politically motivated. In a similar case last November, photos of imprisoned activist Maria Kalesnikava, who headed Babaryka&apos;s electoral campaign and later worked with another oppositionist, Sviatlana Tsikahnouskaya, emerged after more than 600 days of no communication.	https://kyivindependent.com/babaryka-photo-published/	2025-01-08T04:12:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwoqjkWQAAIpIT.jpeg
Trump calls on NATO to raise defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 7 that NATO should raise its defense spending benchmark from 2% of GDP to 5%, echoing his earlier calls for Europe to spend more on its security. &quot;I think NATO should have 5%,&quot; Trump said at a news conference in Florida. This confirms earlier reports about the incoming U.S. president urging allies to raise defense spending to a benchmark no NATO member has reached as of now, including the U.S. Trump is not the only one urging defense spending hikes. Other members of the 32-strong alliance see Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Trump&apos;s isolationism as an incentive to take more responsibility for their collective security. Allies are reportedly discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030, still below Trump&apos;s proposed target. As of 2025, some NATO members like Italy, Canada, or Spain have not even reached the current 2% target, though the number of allies that do has risen to 24 last year. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). Last February, Trump sparked international outrage by saying he would urge Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, in a declaration indicating his disregard for the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-on-nato-to-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defense/	2025-01-08T03:17:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Poroshenko's party urges ban on Russian oil transit via Ukraine	Ex-President Petro Poroshenko and members of his European Solidarity opposition party submitted a bill on Jan. 7 banning the transit of Russian oil and gas through Ukraine&apos;s territory during martial law. The move came after Ukraine decided not to prolong a deal on the transit of Russian gas to the EU through Ukrainian pipelines past Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine continues to facilitate the transit of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline, fulfilling a contract valid until the end of 2029. &quot;Every day, the Druzhba oil pipeline transports 300,000 barrels of Russian oil... Every day when the halt to Russian oil transit is delayed, tens of millions of dollars flow to Russia,&quot; Poroshenko said at a press briefing. &quot;In 2025 in total, Russia plans to receive $7.5 billion only from the sale of oil through Ukrainian transit.&quot; The text of the bill, signed by Poroshenko and 17 other European Solidarity MPs, has not yet been published. The legislation must be considered by relevant committees, approved in two readings, and signed by the president before becoming law, potentially a lengthy process. Revenues from fossil fuel exports represent a significant part of Russia&apos;s federal budget and play a key role in fueling its war machine in Ukraine. The EU banned the import of Russian seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products in June 2022 as part of sanctions imposed in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Certain member states were given exemptions due to their dependency on Russian supplies, allowing them to continue buying Russian pipeline oil. Russian crude continues to flow to Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline, which also runs through Ukraine. Halting the oil transit might fuel further discord between Ukraine and Hungary with Slovakia. The two EU countries, led by Moscow-friendly populists, have already lashed out against Kyiv over its decision not to prolong gas transit, claiming it undermines their energy security.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenkos-party-urges-ban-on-russian-oil-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-08T02:36:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US lawmakers submit resolution labeling Russia's war in Ukraine genocide	A draft resolution to recognize Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine as genocidal was among the first bills submitted to the new U.S. Congress on Jan. 6., the Congress&#x2019; website showed. The draft resolution was submitted by a bipartisan group of legislators, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said in a Facebook post. &quot;Systematic actions against the Ukrainian people committed by Russian forces under the direction of Russian Federation political leadership meets one or more of the criteria under Article II of the Genocide Convention,&quot; the draft resolution&#x2019;s preamble read. The resolution cites the Russian military&#x2019;s intentional targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, systematic sexual violence against Ukrainian women, men, and children, as well as the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. &quot;All crimes committed by the Russian Federation must be reflected in U.S. law to ensure that Russian criminals are punished and to prevent such heinous crimes in the future,&quot; the Ukrainian ambassador wrote in her post. &quot;Currently, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office of Ukraine has opened 170,090 cases of crimes related to the aggression of the Russian Federation (151,698 for war crimes),&quot; Markarova added. The draft resolution calls on the U.S. to condemn Russia and support Ukraine and international jurisdiction against those responsible for Russia&#x2019;s actions. In early 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-submit-resolution-labeling-russias-war-in-ukraine-genocide/	2025-01-08T02:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Azerbaijan's President Aliyev calls Armenia 'fascist state, threat to region'	Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Jan. 7 called Armenia effectively a &quot;fascist state,&quot; claiming that Baku might have no other choice but to &quot;destroy&quot; its neighbor&apos;s so-called &quot;fascist ideology.&quot; Azerbaijan and Armenia are bitter rivals, having clashed in multiple territorial and ethnic conflicts since they gained independence three decades ago. Speaking in an interview with local television channels, Aliyev accused Armenian authorities of being bearers of a &quot;fascist ideology&quot; for 30 years, shaping the country in their image. He also called Armenia a &quot;threat to the region.&quot; The Azerbaijani strongman issued thinly veiled threats against Armenia, saying that &quot;fascism must be destroyed. It will be destroyed either by the Armenian leadership or by us. We have no other choice.&quot; In September 2023, Baku&apos;s forces captured the Nagorno-Karabakh region, de jure Azerbaijani territory that, at the time, was de facto ruled by ethnic Armenian authorities and had been a key point of contest between the two countries. Almost the entire 100,000-strong Armenian population fled the region following Azerbaijan&apos;s lightning offensive. As Yerevan and Baku lead bilateral talks on normalizing relations and settling outstanding border disputes, Armenian authorities have accused Azerbaijan, currently the stronger player in the region, of planning further hostilities. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said last December that the Azerbaijani side received proposals on two unresolved issues in the negotiations but has yet to respond. &quot;If Azerbaijan also doesn&#x2019;t have intentions to attack Armenia, then the likelihood of escalation in the region is zero,&quot; Pashinyan said in an interview last month. Aliyev also called on France and other countries to stop providing arms to Armenia and take back the weapons already provided. Yerevan has deepened security cooperation with the West after its traditional ally, Russia, did not step in to prevent Azerbaijan&apos;s attack in 2023 despite having peacekeepers deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijans-president-aliyev-calls-armenia-fascist-state/	2025-01-08T01:45:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2162500509.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian oil depot supplying fuel to Engels-2 airbase, military confirms	Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian oil depot in Engels, Saratov Oblast, overnight on Jan. 8, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks. The operation, carried out jointly by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the Unmanned Systems Forces, and other units, targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase, the military said. The statement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported a drone attack in the area, with footage of the burning oil facility circulating on social media. The city of Engels lies around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time amid a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the city. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused. Busargin said that there were no injuries as a result of the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 11 Ukrainian attack drones were downed over Saratov Oblast. &quot;The depot&apos;s destruction creates significant logistical problems for Russian strategic aviation and reduces its ability to attack peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian facilities,&quot; the General Staff said. The Engels-2 base hosts the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, operating Tu-160 bombers, and the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment with the Tupolev Tu-95 MS planes. Russia uses these aircraft to launch mass strikes on Ukraine, often resulting in heavy damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces have previously launched drone strikes targeting the airbase itself.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-oil-depot-in-russias-saratov-oblast-military-confirms/	2025-01-08T01:05:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwD6KeaUAAgJXL-1.png
Venezuela detains 3 Ukrainians, accuses them of 'terror' plot	Venezuela&apos;s President Nicolas Maduro announced the detention of three Ukrainians days before his inauguration, calling them &quot;mercenaries&quot; and accusing them of plotting &quot;terrorist&quot; actions, Spanish news agency EFE reported on Jan. 8. Venezuelan authorities also detained two U.S. and two Colombian citizens, raising the same accusations against them. &quot;Today alone, we have captured&#x2026;, seven foreign mercenaries, including two important U.S. mercenaries,&quot; Maduro said at an event in Caracas. The group was planning a terrorist attack against &quot;the peace of Venezuela,&quot; the president alleged. Maduro did not provide evidence to support his claims. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on Caracas&apos; claims, and a spokesperson did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request at the time of publication. Maduro is preparing for his inauguration on Jan. 10 to become the president of Venezuela for the next six years after two consecutive terms, claiming election victory in July 2024 amid widespread reports of fraud. The opposition&#x2019;s presidential nominee, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, also plans to take the presidential oath. The U.S. and several other nations have recognized Urrutia as the legitimate president-elect. The Venezuelan government claims to have detained overall 125 &quot;mercenaries&quot; in November and December, all part of an alleged scheme to attack Maduro&#x2019;s Vice President and Hydrocarbons Minister Delcy Rodriguez. Maduro has a close relationship with Moscow, bolstered by their shared animosity toward the West. Venezuela&apos;s president has denounced Western sanctions imposed against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called Caracas and Moscow &quot;loyal allies.&quot; Last summer, two Russian naval ships docked in Venezuela&apos;s La Guaira port after exercises in the North Atlantic, supposedly to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/venezuela-detains-ukrainians/	2025-01-08T00:31:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2165038982.jpg
Hackers claim to have breached Russia’s real estate database, Moscow denies	A hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed to have hacked and obtained data from Russia&apos;s state cadastre and cartography agency, the independent Russian news outlet Agentstvo reported on Jan. 7. Russia&#x2019;s state register denied the news, issuing a statement that said: &quot;Additional checks of the information published in a number of Telegram channels are currently underway.&quot; The stolen database contained the internal identification of each recording, the name of the real estate&#x2019;s owner (full name or the name of the legal entity), their date of birth, details of documents (passport), address, and sometimes also phone numbers dating until early 2024, Agentstvo reported. Agentstvo randomly selected and checked 15 recordings, which all corresponded to real owners. The hackers claimed to have stolen 2 billion lines, publishing 82 million as proof. It is unclear who is behind the group. The Silent Crow channel where the alleged hack was published was created on Dec. 25. The channel&apos;s only post is from Jan. 6 and concerns the leak. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the group&#x2019;s claims. Many investigative journalists used Russia&#x2019;s state registry to expose corruption by showing if someone&#x2019;s property worth was above their pay grade until 2023, when a Russian law banned the publication of personal information for third parties without the registered person or company&#x2019;s consent. Both Russia and Ukraine have widely used cyberattacks to target government institutions and key businesses during the full-scale war. In December, a Russian-backed cyberattack targeted several state registers overseen by Ukraine&apos;s Justice Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/hackers-claimed-to-have-hacked-russias-real-estate-database-moscow-denies/	2025-01-07T23:57:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 13 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 8. Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Air defenses shot down 41 drones over nine different oblasts, while 22 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, three flew to Russia, and one to Belarus, according to the statement. Three civilians were injured during Russian attacks against the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and nine injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three high-rise buildings, five houses, a bus, a garage, and other civilian property was damaged. A civilian was injured and a house damaged during a Russian drone attack against the Shostka community in Sumy Oblast, according to the regional military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-116/	2025-01-07T23:29:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_06-30-09.jpg
Pentagon official coordinating Ukraine aid resigns ahead of Trump inauguration	Laura Cooper, senior Pentagon official leading the Russia and Ukraine office, stepped down as Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration looms, Politico reported on Jan. 6, citing one former and three current officials. A veteran civil servant, Cooper has held senior U.S. Defense Department positions since Trump&apos;s first term in office in 2017 and, more recently, was responsible for coordinating U.S. aid for Ukraine during the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. Politico linked her resignation to the growing uncertainty about upcoming changes in the Pentagon under Trump&apos;s administration, namely regarding the future Ukraine policy. According to the outlet, Cooper&apos;s resignation may also be connected to her testimonies in Trump&apos;s impeachment inquiry in 2019. The proceedings were launched after the then-U.S. president was said to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals by threatening to withhold military aid. Often critical of the Biden administration&apos;s extensive backing of Kyiv, Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war by pushing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The incoming U.S. president has often voiced sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and presented Moscow&apos;s worries about Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations as a legitimate concern. At the same time, Trump said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine and instead leverage U.S. assistance to push for peace talks. Cooper has been temporarily replaced by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance Steven Schleien, but broad personnel changes are expected at the Pentagon after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. With less than two weeks in office left, the Biden administration seeks to deliver as much aid to Ukraine as possible to put it in the strongest possible position in any potential 2025 negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-official-coordinating-ukraine-aid-reportedly-resigns/	2025-01-07T22:59:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1178978808--1-.jpg

Zelensky signs law strengthening process for creating, designating list of terrorist organizations	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill on Jan. 7 strengthening the process for the formation and designation of groups and organizations to Ukraine&apos;s terror list. The law, which formally assigns responsibility to Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) to maintain a list of terrorist organizations, is set to better define and name organizations that pose a threat to the country&apos;s national security. Ahead of the legislation, a designated terror list was managed informally through the country&apos;s national security institutions. The bill formally defines mechanism for a group&apos;s inclusion into the list and will name terrorist networks that operate both within Ukraine and abroad &#x2014; regardless of whether they&apos;re a registered legal entity in Ukraine. The list will be administered by the SBU&apos;s Anti-Terrorism Center and will be publicly accessible through the government&apos;s website. The law mandates that political parties, regardless of their activities, not be included on the terror list. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine, along with a number of Western countries and institutions designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-strengthening-process-for-creating-designating-list-of-terror-organizations/	2025-01-07T21:45:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Upcoming Ramstein summit to focus on supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities through 2027, Pentagon says, as Trump inauguration looms	The Jan. 9 Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will focus primarily on supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities in establishing a &quot;credible deterrent force&quot; through 2027, the Pentagon said on Jan. 7. &quot;The leaders of (UDCG) will need to endorse roadmaps that articulate Ukraine&apos;s air force, armor, artillery, de-mining, drone, integrated air and missile defense, information technology and maritime security needs and objectives through 2027,&quot; a unnamed defense official is quoted as saying by the Defense Department&apos;s news channel. &quot;These roadmaps are intended to enable donors to plan for and support Ukraine sustainably into the future,&quot; the official added. The statement by Pentagon officials comes ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, who has vowed who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and negotiate a quick peace deal. Trump, who has previously been critical of the U.S. participation in international military alliances, including NATO, stirred controversy on Jan. 7, blaming President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s war by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand their (Russia&apos;s) feelings about that,&quot; Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. Leaders of the U.S.-led UDCG previously mulled the idea of implementing NATO control over the Ramstein format to maintain weapons supplies to Kyiv in an effort to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the alliance. In June, NATO countries signed off on a plan for the alliance to take over control of part of the aid channel from the U.S. in coordinating military aid to Ukraine, Politico reported. Trump has not yet outlined his plans for the contact group, as the incoming president seeks to negotiate a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine in exchange for reported security guarantees from Europe. &quot;I can&apos;t speak for what the incoming administration will decide about its role (within the UDCG), but I&apos;m very confident of European commitment&#x2026; ability&#x2026; experience and extraordinary belief in the mission, and (am) confident that those capability coalitions will continue one way or another,&quot; the Pentagon&apos;s news channel reported an official saying. European countries have sought to ramp up their own military spending, as well as additional support for Ukraine, amid concerns Trump will end military aid for Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing that several European countries are interested in deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine in an initiative led primarily by French President Emmanuel Macron. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/upcoming-ramstein-summit-to-focus-on-supporting-ukraines-defense-capabilities-through-2027-pentagon-says-as-trump-inauguration-looms/	2025-01-07T19:55:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1252040987.jpg
Large fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Saratov Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire engulfed an oil depot overnight on Jan. 8 in the city of Engels in Saratov Oblast, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said that Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time. Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported, citing resident accounts, that that an oil depot in the city had caught fire. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the claims. Videos circulating on social media appear to show a large fire burning at the oil depot, as Russian air defense attempts to down the reported drones over the city. Residents reported hearing at least five explosions ahead of the fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Video captured by local residents of a fire reportedly caused by Ukrainian drones in the city of Engels in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast overnight on Jan. 8, 2025. (ASTRA/Telegram)Firefighters are on-scene attempting to extinguish the blaze, Busargin added. No information was immediately available on any casualties or on the extent of the damage caused. Engels, located over 750 kilometers away from the nearest Ukrainian-controlled border, has previously been a target of Ukrainian drone attack, with the city housing the the Engels-2 air base. Over the past year, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial to sustain Moscow&apos;s war efforts, as well as its military hardware. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues, Ukraine has also continued to attack Russian targets along the Russia-Ukraine border to inflict damage to the country&apos;s military supply chain.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-reported-in-russias-saratov-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-07T18:05:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_20-34-41.jpg
Chinese port ban on US-sanctioned tankers tightens oil supply, Reuters reports	Shandong Port Group has prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province, three traders familiar with the issue told Reuters. This region, home to many independent refiners, is a significant importer of oil from countries under U.S. embargoes. Last year, Shandong imported approximately 1.74 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, accounting for about 17% of China&#x2019;s total imports, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company that provides real-time intelligence on commodity flows, energy markets, and maritime activities. The ban, if enforced, is expected to increase shipping costs for Shandong&#x2019;s independent refiners, which rely heavily on discounted sanctioned crude from these countries, traders told Reuters. The move follows Washington&apos;s recent expansion of sanctions on companies and tankers involved in the Iranian oil trade. President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office on Jan. 20, is anticipated to further tighten restrictions on Iran, continuing a pattern from his previous administration. Traders believe the ban could also slow oil imports into China, the world&#x2019;s largest importer of crude. A notice issued by Shandong Port on Jan. 6, verified by three traders, said that ports are prohibited from docking, unloading, or servicing vessels listed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Treasury. Shandong Port manages key facilities on China&#x2019;s east coast, including Qingdao, Rizhao, and Yantai, which serve as significant hubs for importing sanctioned oil. In a follow-up notice on Jan. 7, reviewed by Reuters, Shandong Port claimed the shipping ban would have a &quot;limited impact&quot; on independent refiners, as much of the sanctioned oil arrives on non-sanctioned tankers. According to Michelle Wiese Bockmann of Lloyd&apos;s List Intelligence, the shadow fleet moving Iranian, Russian, and Venezuelan oil comprises roughly 669 tankers. Between October and December, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 35 tankers identified as part of Iran&#x2019;s &quot;ghost fleet.&quot; Separate sanctions were also imposed on Sovcomflot, a major Russian tanker operator, early in 2024. Sources revealed that the outgoing Biden administration intends to sanction over 100 tankers linked to Russian oil, further constraining shipping options. Analysts anticipate the shift to non-sanctioned tankers will drive up costs for Shandong refiners, which are already struggling with low margins and weak demand. The sanctions are already affecting global oil prices and shipping logistics. Shares in Frontline, a leading tanker operator, surged over 9% following the port ban announcement, reflecting an anticipated tightening of tanker supply.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-port-ban-on-us-sanctioned-tankers-tightens-oil-supply-reuters-reports/	2025-01-07T15:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
