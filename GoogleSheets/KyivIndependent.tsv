Polish consulate in St. Petersburg closes after over 50 years	Poland&#x2019;s consulate in the Russian city of St. Petersburg has shut down, with the staff taking down the Polish and EU flags and clearing out the building, the Polish RMF24 news outlet reported on Jan. 8. Poland closed its consulate building in St. Petersburg after 53 years. The decision follows Warsaw&apos;s order to close a Russian consulate in the Polish city of Poznan last year after accusing Moscow of sabotage plots. &quot;The ceremony took place in a very dignified manner,&quot; said Polish Ambassador to Russia Krzysztof Krajewski who was in attendance. &quot;The move has been underway for some time now.&quot; Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, providing weapons and taking in as many as 1 million refugees. Recently, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski called for a &quot;fair peace&quot; for Ukraine in a speech delivered to French diplomats in Paris, following French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s remarks that Ukraine should prepare for &quot;realistic&quot; discussions on territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-consulate-in-st-petersburg-closes-after-50-years/	2025-01-08T06:11:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192359114--1-.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast, military reports	Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. The military said that Russia has seized the facility to coordinate attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilians, especially in Kurakhove. After weeks of heavy battles, Russia announced earlier this week it had fully captured Kurakhove. &quot;All necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians,&quot; the General Staff noted. Khartsyzk lies around 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the Russian-held Donetsk and has been occupied by Russia since the start of its aggression in 2014. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted. Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. Similar attacks were reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast-military-reports/	2025-01-08T05:52:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
Ground Forces chief reports to Zelensky on 155th Brigade, names those responsible for 'systematic shortcomings'	General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces chief, reported to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the roots of the problems facing the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and presented solutions, Drapatyi said on Jan. 8. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. &quot;Most of the systemic shortcomings were committed by the Ground Forces Command, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Operational Command,&quot; the commander wrote on social media. Drapatyi was appointed to lead the Ground Forces last November, months after the brigade was formed. Without revealing all the details before &quot;all the circumstances are established,&quot; Drapatyi acknowledged &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; within the unit. The commander said the biggest challenge was the &quot;low efficiency and motivation of mid-level commanders who directly manage people.&quot; Relevant solutions are already being implemented, with a focus on &quot;recruiting experienced officers and commanders at all levels,&quot; the general said, adding that the 155th Brigade&#x2019;s soldiers will receive additional training. Service members of the unit will also be provided a hotline, the commander said. &quot;In addition to the official daily reports, I want to have direct contact and hear from the soldiers&#x2026; how our decisions affect their motivation and the real state of affairs,&quot; he added. According to the general, the brigade also received psychologists to strengthen its cohesion while holding positions near Pokrovsk. &quot;The French side has fully fulfilled its obligations to Ukraine,&quot; he stressed. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, pointed to problems in the brigade&apos;s creation and management, allegedly leading to 1,700 cases of soldiers going AWOL from the unit before firing a shot.	https://kyivindependent.com/ground-forces-chief-reports-to-zelensky-on-155th-brigade-names-those-responsible-for-systematic-shortcomings/	2025-01-08T05:25:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg
NATO reportedly sending ships to guard cables under Baltic Sea	A fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April, the Finnish broadcaster Yle reported on Jan. 7 after several cables were cut in suspected sabotage. The ships, mainly from Finland and Estonia, will patrol the Gulf of Finland, Yle reported. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. In a separate initiative, the U.K-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has set up a tracking system to alert allies if a ship poses a threat to undersea cable infrastructure. NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-reportedly-sending-ships-to-guard-cables/	2025-01-08T04:27:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-471415136.jpg
Photos of jailed Belarusian opposition leader appear after almost 2 years of no news	Photos and a video of Viktar Babaryka were published by blogger Raman Pratasevich on Jan. 8 after the jailed Belarusian opposition leader was held incommunicado since February 2023. The footage was released weeks after Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 political prisoners in an apparent goodwill gesture ahead of the presidential election on Jan. 26. Lukashenko has ruled the country since 1994, cementing his power through widespread repressions, secret police, and electoral fraud. The dictator claimed victory in the last 2020 election after rigging the vote and violently suppressing the subsequent protests and is expected to secure his seventh term later this month. Photos of Babaryka and an excerpt from his video appeal to relatives have been published on the Telegram channel of Pratasevich, formerly a dissident and editor-in-chief of the opposition news channel Nexta who became a regime apologist after his arrest in 2021 and subsequent pardon. The pictures show the opposition leader dressed in black clothes, with a yellow sign designating him as &quot;prone to extremist activities,&quot; writing something on paper. According to the Viasna human rights group, Babaryka has not been seen since Feb. 5, 2023. Pratasevich said he had passed letters between Babaryka and his family members. Babaryka intended to run for the 2020 presidential election but was rejected and, in 2021, sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges of bribery and tax evasion broadly seen as politically motivated. In a similar case last November, photos of imprisoned activist Maria Kalesnikava, who headed Babaryka&apos;s electoral campaign and later worked with another oppositionist, Sviatlana Tsikahnouskaya, emerged after more than 600 days of no communication.	https://kyivindependent.com/babaryka-photo-published/	2025-01-08T04:12:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwoqjkWQAAIpIT.jpeg
Trump calls on NATO to raise defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 7 that NATO should raise its defense spending benchmark from 2% of GDP to 5%, echoing his earlier calls for Europe to spend more on its security. &quot;I think NATO should have 5%,&quot; Trump said at a news conference in Florida. This confirms earlier reports about the incoming U.S. president urging allies to raise defense spending to a benchmark no NATO member has reached as of now, including the U.S. Trump is not the only one urging defense spending hikes. Other members of the 32-strong alliance see Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Trump&apos;s isolationism as an incentive to take more responsibility for their collective security. Allies are reportedly discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030, still below Trump&apos;s proposed target. As of 2025, some NATO members like Italy, Canada, or Spain have not even reached the current 2% target, though the number of allies that do has risen to 24 last year. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). Last February, Trump sparked international outrage by saying he would urge Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, in a declaration indicating his disregard for the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-on-nato-to-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defense/	2025-01-08T03:17:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Poroshenko's party urges ban on Russian oil transit via Ukraine	Ex-President Petro Poroshenko and members of his European Solidarity opposition party submitted a bill on Jan. 7 banning the transit of Russian oil and gas through Ukraine&apos;s territory during martial law. The move came after Ukraine decided not to prolong a deal on the transit of Russian gas to the EU through Ukrainian pipelines past Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine continues to facilitate the transit of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline, fulfilling a contract valid until the end of 2029. &quot;Every day, the Druzhba oil pipeline transports 300,000 barrels of Russian oil... Every day when the halt to Russian oil transit is delayed, tens of millions of dollars flow to Russia,&quot; Poroshenko said at a press briefing. &quot;In 2025 in total, Russia plans to receive $7.5 billion only from the sale of oil through Ukrainian transit.&quot; The text of the bill, signed by Poroshenko and 17 other European Solidarity MPs, has not yet been published. The legislation must be considered by relevant committees, approved in two readings, and signed by the president before becoming law, potentially a lengthy process. Revenues from fossil fuel exports represent a significant part of Russia&apos;s federal budget and play a key role in fueling its war machine in Ukraine. The EU banned the import of Russian seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products in June 2022 as part of sanctions imposed in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Certain member states were given exemptions due to their dependency on Russian supplies, allowing them to continue buying Russian pipeline oil. Russian crude continues to flow to Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline, which also runs through Ukraine. Halting the oil transit might fuel further discord between Ukraine and Hungary with Slovakia. The two EU countries, led by Moscow-friendly populists, have already lashed out against Kyiv over its decision not to prolong gas transit, claiming it undermines their energy security.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenkos-party-urges-ban-on-russian-oil-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-08T02:36:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US lawmakers submit resolution labeling Russia's war in Ukraine genocide	A draft resolution to recognize Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine as genocidal was among the first bills submitted to the new U.S. Congress on Jan. 6., the Congress&#x2019; website showed. The draft resolution was submitted by a bipartisan group of legislators, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said in a Facebook post. &quot;Systematic actions against the Ukrainian people committed by Russian forces under the direction of Russian Federation political leadership meets one or more of the criteria under Article II of the Genocide Convention,&quot; the draft resolution&#x2019;s preamble read. The resolution cites the Russian military&#x2019;s intentional targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, systematic sexual violence against Ukrainian women, men, and children, as well as the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. &quot;All crimes committed by the Russian Federation must be reflected in U.S. law to ensure that Russian criminals are punished and to prevent such heinous crimes in the future,&quot; the Ukrainian ambassador wrote in her post. &quot;Currently, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office of Ukraine has opened 170,090 cases of crimes related to the aggression of the Russian Federation (151,698 for war crimes),&quot; Markarova added. The draft resolution calls on the U.S. to condemn Russia and support Ukraine and international jurisdiction against those responsible for Russia&#x2019;s actions. In early 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-submit-resolution-labeling-russias-war-in-ukraine-genocide/	2025-01-08T02:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Azerbaijan's President Aliyev calls Armenia 'fascist state, threat to region'	Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Jan. 7 called Armenia effectively a &quot;fascist state,&quot; claiming that Baku might have no other choice but to &quot;destroy&quot; its neighbor&apos;s so-called &quot;fascist ideology.&quot; Azerbaijan and Armenia are bitter rivals, having clashed in multiple territorial and ethnic conflicts since they gained independence three decades ago. Speaking in an interview with local television channels, Aliyev accused Armenian authorities of being bearers of a &quot;fascist ideology&quot; for 30 years, shaping the country in their image. He also called Armenia a &quot;threat to the region.&quot; The Azerbaijani strongman issued thinly veiled threats against Armenia, saying that &quot;fascism must be destroyed. It will be destroyed either by the Armenian leadership or by us. We have no other choice.&quot; In September 2023, Baku&apos;s forces captured the Nagorno-Karabakh region, de jure Azerbaijani territory that, at the time, was de facto ruled by ethnic Armenian authorities and had been a key point of contest between the two countries. Almost the entire 100,000-strong Armenian population fled the region following Azerbaijan&apos;s lightning offensive. As Yerevan and Baku lead bilateral talks on normalizing relations and settling outstanding border disputes, Armenian authorities have accused Azerbaijan, currently the stronger player in the region, of planning further hostilities. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said last December that the Azerbaijani side received proposals on two unresolved issues in the negotiations but has yet to respond. &quot;If Azerbaijan also doesn&#x2019;t have intentions to attack Armenia, then the likelihood of escalation in the region is zero,&quot; Pashinyan said in an interview last month. Aliyev also called on France and other countries to stop providing arms to Armenia and take back the weapons already provided. Yerevan has deepened security cooperation with the West after its traditional ally, Russia, did not step in to prevent Azerbaijan&apos;s attack in 2023 despite having peacekeepers deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijans-president-aliyev-calls-armenia-fascist-state/	2025-01-08T01:45:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2162500509.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian oil depot supplying fuel to Engels-2 airbase, military confirms	Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian oil depot in Engels, Saratov Oblast, overnight on Jan. 8, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks. The operation, carried out jointly by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the Unmanned Systems Forces, and other units, targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase, the military said. The statement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported a drone attack in the area, with footage of the burning oil facility circulating on social media. The city of Engels lies around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time amid a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the city. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused. Busargin said that there were no injuries as a result of the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 11 Ukrainian attack drones were downed over Saratov Oblast. &quot;The depot&apos;s destruction creates significant logistical problems for Russian strategic aviation and reduces its ability to attack peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian facilities,&quot; the General Staff said. The Engels-2 base hosts the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, operating Tu-160 bombers, and the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment with the Tupolev Tu-95 MS planes. Russia uses these aircraft to launch mass strikes on Ukraine, often resulting in heavy damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces have previously launched drone strikes targeting the airbase itself.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-oil-depot-in-russias-saratov-oblast-military-confirms/	2025-01-08T01:05:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwD6KeaUAAgJXL-1.png
Venezuela detains 3 Ukrainians, accuses them of 'terror' plot	Venezuela&apos;s President Nicolas Maduro announced the detention of three Ukrainians days before his inauguration, calling them &quot;mercenaries&quot; and accusing them of plotting &quot;terrorist&quot; actions, Spanish news agency EFE reported on Jan. 8. Venezuelan authorities also detained two U.S. and two Colombian citizens, raising the same accusations against them. &quot;Today alone, we have captured&#x2026;, seven foreign mercenaries, including two important U.S. mercenaries,&quot; Maduro said at an event in Caracas. The group was planning a terrorist attack against &quot;the peace of Venezuela,&quot; the president alleged. Maduro did not provide evidence to support his claims. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on Caracas&apos; claims, and a spokesperson did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request at the time of publication. Maduro is preparing for his inauguration on Jan. 10 to become the president of Venezuela for the next six years after two consecutive terms, claiming election victory in July 2024 amid widespread reports of fraud. The opposition&#x2019;s presidential nominee, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, also plans to take the presidential oath. The U.S. and several other nations have recognized Urrutia as the legitimate president-elect. The Venezuelan government claims to have detained overall 125 &quot;mercenaries&quot; in November and December, all part of an alleged scheme to attack Maduro&#x2019;s Vice President and Hydrocarbons Minister Delcy Rodriguez. Maduro has a close relationship with Moscow, bolstered by their shared animosity toward the West. Venezuela&apos;s president has denounced Western sanctions imposed against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called Caracas and Moscow &quot;loyal allies.&quot; Last summer, two Russian naval ships docked in Venezuela&apos;s La Guaira port after exercises in the North Atlantic, supposedly to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/venezuela-detains-ukrainians/	2025-01-08T00:31:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2165038982.jpg
Hackers claim to have breached Russia’s real estate database, Moscow denies	A hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed to have hacked and obtained data from Russia&apos;s state cadastre and cartography agency, the independent Russian news outlet Agentstvo reported on Jan. 7. Russia&#x2019;s state register denied the news, issuing a statement that said: &quot;Additional checks of the information published in a number of Telegram channels are currently underway.&quot; The stolen database contained the internal identification of each recording, the name of the real estate&#x2019;s owner (full name or the name of the legal entity), their date of birth, details of documents (passport), address, and sometimes also phone numbers dating until early 2024, Agentstvo reported. Agentstvo randomly selected and checked 15 recordings, which all corresponded to real owners. The hackers claimed to have stolen 2 billion lines, publishing 82 million as proof. It is unclear who is behind the group. The Silent Crow channel where the alleged hack was published was created on Dec. 25. The channel&apos;s only post is from Jan. 6 and concerns the leak. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the group&#x2019;s claims. Many investigative journalists used Russia&#x2019;s state registry to expose corruption by showing if someone&#x2019;s property worth was above their pay grade until 2023, when a Russian law banned the publication of personal information for third parties without the registered person or company&#x2019;s consent. Both Russia and Ukraine have widely used cyberattacks to target government institutions and key businesses during the full-scale war. In December, a Russian-backed cyberattack targeted several state registers overseen by Ukraine&apos;s Justice Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/hackers-claimed-to-have-hacked-russias-real-estate-database-moscow-denies/	2025-01-07T23:57:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 13 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 8. Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Air defenses shot down 41 drones over nine different oblasts, while 22 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, three flew to Russia, and one to Belarus, according to the statement. Three civilians were injured during Russian attacks against the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and nine injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three high-rise buildings, five houses, a bus, a garage, and other civilian property was damaged. A civilian was injured and a house damaged during a Russian drone attack against the Shostka community in Sumy Oblast, according to the regional military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-116/	2025-01-07T23:29:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_06-30-09.jpg
Pentagon official coordinating Ukraine aid resigns ahead of Trump inauguration	Laura Cooper, senior Pentagon official leading the Russia and Ukraine office, stepped down as Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration looms, Politico reported on Jan. 6, citing one former and three current officials. A veteran civil servant, Cooper has held senior U.S. Defense Department positions since Trump&apos;s first term in office in 2017 and, more recently, was responsible for coordinating U.S. aid for Ukraine during the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. Politico linked her resignation to the growing uncertainty about upcoming changes in the Pentagon under Trump&apos;s administration, namely regarding the future Ukraine policy. According to the outlet, Cooper&apos;s resignation may also be connected to her testimonies in Trump&apos;s impeachment inquiry in 2019. The proceedings were launched after the then-U.S. president was said to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals by threatening to withhold military aid. Often critical of the Biden administration&apos;s extensive backing of Kyiv, Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war by pushing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The incoming U.S. president has often voiced sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and presented Moscow&apos;s worries about Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations as a legitimate concern. At the same time, Trump said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine and instead leverage U.S. assistance to push for peace talks. Cooper has been temporarily replaced by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance Steven Schleien, but broad personnel changes are expected at the Pentagon after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. With less than two weeks in office left, the Biden administration seeks to deliver as much aid to Ukraine as possible to put it in the strongest possible position in any potential 2025 negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-official-coordinating-ukraine-aid-reportedly-resigns/	2025-01-07T22:59:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1178978808--1-.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 801,670 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 801,670 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. This number includes 1,660 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,714 tanks, 20,205 armored fighting vehicles, 33,307 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,729 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,038 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,727 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-801-670-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-07T22:19:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2003918251.jpg
Zelensky signs law strengthening process for creating, designating list of terrorist organizations	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill on Jan. 7 strengthening the process for the formation and designation of groups and organizations to Ukraine&apos;s terror list. The law, which formally assigns responsibility to Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) to maintain a list of terrorist organizations, is set to better define and name organizations that pose a threat to the country&apos;s national security. Ahead of the legislation, a designated terror list was managed informally through the country&apos;s national security institutions. The bill formally defines mechanism for a group&apos;s inclusion into the list and will name terrorist networks that operate both within Ukraine and abroad &#x2014; regardless of whether they&apos;re a registered legal entity in Ukraine. The list will be administered by the SBU&apos;s Anti-Terrorism Center and will be publicly accessible through the government&apos;s website. The law mandates that political parties, regardless of their activities, not be included on the terror list. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine, along with a number of Western countries and institutions designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-strengthening-process-for-creating-designating-list-of-terror-organizations/	2025-01-07T21:45:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Upcoming Ramstein summit to focus on supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities through 2027, Pentagon says, as Trump inauguration looms	The Jan. 9 Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will focus primarily on supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities in establishing a &quot;credible deterrent force&quot; through 2027, the Pentagon said on Jan. 7. &quot;The leaders of (UDCG) will need to endorse roadmaps that articulate Ukraine&apos;s air force, armor, artillery, de-mining, drone, integrated air and missile defense, information technology and maritime security needs and objectives through 2027,&quot; a unnamed defense official is quoted as saying by the Defense Department&apos;s news channel. &quot;These roadmaps are intended to enable donors to plan for and support Ukraine sustainably into the future,&quot; the official added. The statement by Pentagon officials comes ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, who has vowed who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and negotiate a quick peace deal. Trump, who has previously been critical of the U.S. participation in international military alliances, including NATO, stirred controversy on Jan. 7, blaming President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s war by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand their (Russia&apos;s) feelings about that,&quot; Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. Leaders of the U.S.-led UDCG previously mulled the idea of implementing NATO control over the Ramstein format to maintain weapons supplies to Kyiv in an effort to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the alliance. In June, NATO countries signed off on a plan for the alliance to take over control of part of the aid channel from the U.S. in coordinating military aid to Ukraine, Politico reported. Trump has not yet outlined his plans for the contact group, as the incoming president seeks to negotiate a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine in exchange for reported security guarantees from Europe. &quot;I can&apos;t speak for what the incoming administration will decide about its role (within the UDCG), but I&apos;m very confident of European commitment&#x2026; ability&#x2026; experience and extraordinary belief in the mission, and (am) confident that those capability coalitions will continue one way or another,&quot; the Pentagon&apos;s news channel reported an official saying. European countries have sought to ramp up their own military spending, as well as additional support for Ukraine, amid concerns Trump will end military aid for Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing that several European countries are interested in deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine in an initiative led primarily by French President Emmanuel Macron. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/upcoming-ramstein-summit-to-focus-on-supporting-ukraines-defense-capabilities-through-2027-pentagon-says-as-trump-inauguration-looms/	2025-01-07T19:55:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1252040987.jpg
Large fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Saratov Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire engulfed an oil depot overnight on Jan. 8 in the city of Engels in Saratov Oblast, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said that Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time. Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported, citing resident accounts, that that an oil depot in the city had caught fire. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the claims. Videos circulating on social media appear to show a large fire burning at the oil depot, as Russian air defense attempts to down the reported drones over the city. Residents reported hearing at least five explosions ahead of the fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Video captured by local residents of a fire reportedly caused by Ukrainian drones in the city of Engels in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast overnight on Jan. 8, 2025. (ASTRA/Telegram)Firefighters are on-scene attempting to extinguish the blaze, Busargin added. No information was immediately available on any casualties or on the extent of the damage caused. Engels, located over 750 kilometers away from the nearest Ukrainian-controlled border, has previously been a target of Ukrainian drone attack, with the city housing the the Engels-2 air base. Over the past year, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial to sustain Moscow&apos;s war efforts, as well as its military hardware. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues, Ukraine has also continued to attack Russian targets along the Russia-Ukraine border to inflict damage to the country&apos;s military supply chain.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-reported-in-russias-saratov-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-07T18:05:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_20-34-41.jpg
Chinese port ban on US-sanctioned tankers tightens oil supply, Reuters reports	Shandong Port Group has prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province, three traders familiar with the issue told Reuters. This region, home to many independent refiners, is a significant importer of oil from countries under U.S. embargoes. Last year, Shandong imported approximately 1.74 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, accounting for about 17% of China&#x2019;s total imports, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company that provides real-time intelligence on commodity flows, energy markets, and maritime activities. The ban, if enforced, is expected to increase shipping costs for Shandong&#x2019;s independent refiners, which rely heavily on discounted sanctioned crude from these countries, traders told Reuters. The move follows Washington&apos;s recent expansion of sanctions on companies and tankers involved in the Iranian oil trade. President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office on Jan. 20, is anticipated to further tighten restrictions on Iran, continuing a pattern from his previous administration. Traders believe the ban could also slow oil imports into China, the world&#x2019;s largest importer of crude. A notice issued by Shandong Port on Jan. 6, verified by three traders, said that ports are prohibited from docking, unloading, or servicing vessels listed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Treasury. Shandong Port manages key facilities on China&#x2019;s east coast, including Qingdao, Rizhao, and Yantai, which serve as significant hubs for importing sanctioned oil. In a follow-up notice on Jan. 7, reviewed by Reuters, Shandong Port claimed the shipping ban would have a &quot;limited impact&quot; on independent refiners, as much of the sanctioned oil arrives on non-sanctioned tankers. According to Michelle Wiese Bockmann of Lloyd&apos;s List Intelligence, the shadow fleet moving Iranian, Russian, and Venezuelan oil comprises roughly 669 tankers. Between October and December, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 35 tankers identified as part of Iran&#x2019;s &quot;ghost fleet.&quot; Separate sanctions were also imposed on Sovcomflot, a major Russian tanker operator, early in 2024. Sources revealed that the outgoing Biden administration intends to sanction over 100 tankers linked to Russian oil, further constraining shipping options. Analysts anticipate the shift to non-sanctioned tankers will drive up costs for Shandong refiners, which are already struggling with low margins and weak demand. The sanctions are already affecting global oil prices and shipping logistics. Shares in Frontline, a leading tanker operator, surged over 9% following the port ban announcement, reflecting an anticipated tightening of tanker supply.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-port-ban-on-us-sanctioned-tankers-tightens-oil-supply-reuters-reports/	2025-01-07T15:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Biden administration prepares final massive Ukraine aid package ahead of Trump inauguration, AP reports	The Biden administration plans to unveil a significant final weapons aid package for Ukraine during Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x2019;s visit to Germany on Jan. 9. Austin is set to meet representatives from around 50 nations that have supported Ukraine since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago, two senior defense officials told the Associated Press. While the officials did not specify the exact value of the aid, they described it as &quot;substantial.&quot; The package will not encompass the approximately $4 billion remaining in congressionally approved funding for Ukraine. However, they noted that &quot;more than a couple of billion dollars&quot; would likely be left for the incoming Trump administration to allocate if it chooses to do so. Ukraine is currently engaged in a second offensive targeting Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region while enduring long-range missile strikes and Russian advancements in Donetsk Oblast. Both sides are maneuvering to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. According to one defense official, Biden administration officials handling Ukraine policy have been coordinating with Trump&#x2019;s transition team to address &quot;all the issues that we believe are important. &quot; Austin&#x2019;s trip to Ramstein Air Base will mark his final meeting with the coalition he formed in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion in February 2022. Over the course of the war, these nations have contributed more than $126 billion in military assistance, including ammunition, advanced fighter jets, air defense systems, counter-UAV technologies, and tanks. The U.S. &#xA0;has provided $66 billion of that total. The upcoming aid package, scheduled to be announced on Jan. 9, will draw from existing stockpiles with the intent of delivering most of the pledged weapons to Ukraine before Trump takes office, one official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-prepares-final-massive-ukraine-aid-package-ahead-of-trump-inauguration-ap-reports/	2025-01-07T12:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251877.jpg
Russian troops overrun Kurakhove, approach Pokrovsk east, south, and southwest	Russia keeps on advancing in eastern Donetsk Oblast, taking hold of Kurakhove, which would become the first major town to fall into Russian hands in 2025. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 that due to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing Kursk incursion, where a potential small-scale Ukrainian offensive is taking place, Russia is unable &quot;to direct all its strength&quot; to other embattled areas, including Donetsk Oblast. Yet, reports indicate that Russian troops are advancing inch by inch in an effort to capture the entire region, with little to no signs that Moscow is to slow down in the immediate future. The active phase of the battle for Kurakhove, once home to more than 18,000 people, has been ongoing since October, and the steady Russian advance in the area suggests its imminent loss. The fall of Vuhledar on Oct. 2 and the subsequent loss of Selydove on Oct. 29 meant that Kurakhove, a town squeezed in between, would turn into Russia&apos;s next main target. Russian troops entered the town in late November, and the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the full capture of Kurakhove on Jan. 6. Ukraine&apos;s military did not confirm.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Speaking on national television, Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said that as of Jan. 7, weeks-long urban fighting in Kurakhove is still ongoing. &quot;There is no question of full Russian control over the town,&quot; he said. &quot;When the town is completely destroyed, there is simply no place to hold the defense because there are actually no fortifications,&quot; the spokesperson said, adding that the situation is very difficult. According to unconfirmed reports, Ukrainian troops still maintain a presence just outside the town, near the destroyed thermal power plant. Ukraine rarely admits withdrawal or loss of a settlement, preferring to say that it is contested, even when it is not. There&apos;s no evidence that Ukraine has the means to retake the town in the near future. &quot;The town has not been strategically very important, as singular towns usually aren&apos;t. They may, however, have operational or tactical relevance, and in this case, for continuing the attack in this direction, capturing Kurakhove was necessary for Russia,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. The Kurakhove bulge has stretched Ukrainian defenses, and gradually retreating towards the village of Ulaky, 10 kilometers west of Kurakhove, would shorten the front line &quot;significantly,&quot; according to Kastehelmi. The highway connecting Zaporizhzhia and occupied Donetsk passes through the two settlements and serves as a major logistics chain for Ukrainian troops in and around Kurakhove. &quot;In this case, the Ukrainians can decide to give up some ground in exchange for a tighter defense, which could be useful in this case,&quot; he said. &quot;Holding onto the fields around Kurakhove for the sake of holding some ground isn&apos;t always the best idea.&quot; Meanwhile, Russian troops continue to approach Pokrovsk further northwest, gaining ground in the neighboring settlements. According to the DeepState crowdsourced map, Russian troops occupied Dachenske, Novyi Trud, Vovkove, Shevchenko, and Ivanivka &#x2014; east, south, and southwest of Pokrovsk. This would put Russian troops within a few kilometers of the city&apos;s outskirts from three sides. Ukraine still controls the main road leading to the city. The Ukrainian military has not confirmed the loss of these settlements. They cannot be independently verified at this time.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)According to Trehubov, Russia is trying to encircle Pokrovsk, the last major settlement in the southwestern part of Donetsk Oblast. Ongoing Russian troop movements are also reported in Toretsk, which experienced a lull in active Russian advancement for a few months. In late December, the Ukrainian military said that Russia started using additional military equipment near the town. &quot;We didn&apos;t see this before, but now the enemy has become more active,&quot; said Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk. Moscow&apos;s troops were conducting assaults all over Toretsk as of Jan. 6, the DeepState claimed. The fighting is ongoing inside the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-overrun-kurakhove-approach-pokrovsk-from-east-south-and-southwest/	2025-01-07T12:33:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190608033.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits Russia's infantry brigade command post in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Key developments on Jan. 7: Ukrainian soldiers struck on Jan. 7 the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade near the village of Belaya in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff claimed. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 100 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. &quot;Such fire damage is an integral part of combat operations of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces units, which are engaged in combat operations on the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; the statement read. No further details on the attack and the extent of the damage were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Another Russian command post came under Ukraine&apos;s attack in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, on Jan. 2, according to the military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. For the first time in the history of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a Ukrainian-operated jet shot down six Russian cruise missiles during a single mission in December, including two with the aircraft cannon, the Air Force claimed on Jan. 7. The interception reportedly took place during a mass Russian aerial strike on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024, which saw Russia deploy almost 200 drones and 94 missiles. &quot;For the first time in the history of the Fighting Falcon, an F-16 fighter jet destroyed six Russian cruise missiles in one combat mission,&quot; the Air Force Command said on social media. Ukraine has received a number of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them multiple times in air defense roles during Russian mass strikes on cities and infrastructure. &quot;They say that even Americans couldn&apos;t believe you did it,&quot; Air Force Command spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with the pilot, whose identity was not revealed. An undated photo of a Ukrainian pilot. (Air Force Command)The aviator said that he approached a group of cruise missiles and, despite their electronic warfare countermeasures, managed to lock on to targets. The F-16 reportedly shot down one pair of Russian projectiles with medium-range missiles and then another pair with short-range missiles. Ukrainian F-16s are equipped with four air-to-air medium-range and short-range missiles. Without missiles and low on fuel, the pilot was then recalled from the area but spotted another missile heading toward Kyiv. He moved to intercept it and opened fire from his aircraft cannon against the projectile, which was flying over 650 kilometers per hour, a difficult and risky maneuver, the Air Force said. &quot;A few bursts from the cannon &#x2014; and an explosion... then another one! &apos;A secondary detonation,&apos; I thought, but, as it turned out, there were two missiles,&quot; the pilot said, adding he did everything as taught by U.S. instructors. According to the Air Force Command, Ukrainian pilots have learned how to shoot down missiles with aircraft cannons in simulators in the U.S. but have never attempted it during actual combat before. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered into service in late 1978, and its various versions have been used by over two dozen countries, including the U.S. and its European allies. More than 4,600 F-16s have been built, and the platform has been deployed in multiple conflicts worldwide. During a Jan. 7 press conference, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership aspirations. Trump argued that Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership has long been a major concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand their [Russia&apos;s] feelings about that.&quot; A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&#x2019;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Trump also criticized Biden&#x2019;s foreign policy decisions, including the withdrawal from Afghanistan, repeating his claims that they contributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s decision to launch a full-scale war against Ukraine. When asked about possible negotiations with Putin, Trump said he would wait until after his Jan. 20 inauguration to hold talks. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s appropriate that I meet until after Jan. 20, which I hate because you know every day people are being &#x2014; many, many young people are being killed &#x2014; soldiers,&quot; he said. On Dec. 19, Putin reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with Trump but upheld Moscow&#x2019;s demands, including the desire to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Trump has pledged during the election campaign to bring a swift end to the war but has not outlined concrete steps for achieving peace. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reiterating Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to a diplomatic resolution by 2025. Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast and a local power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult,&quot; a military spokesperson said on Jan. 7. &quot;The situation in Kurakhove is really quite difficult right now because a significant part of the city has been destroyed,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 7, only a day after Russia claimed to have full control over the town. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. &quot;Ukrainian troops are holding on the western part of the town, its western outskirts. They are also holding onto a power plant located in the town,&quot; Trehubov added. According to the spokesperson, Russian forces are attempting to raze Kurakhove building by building, destroying any potential defenses for Ukrainian soldiers. This method mirrors Russian tactics used in other front-line towns like Toretsk, where there are reportedly &quot;no intact buildings left&quot; after Moscow&apos;s onslaught. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 6, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)In its Jan. 7 report, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported fending off 26 Russian assaults in the Kurakhove sector, including in the area of the town itself. The DeepState monitoring group shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, save for small areas in the west. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-jan-7/	2025-01-07T12:09:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Believed he was making a difference' — Scottish combat medic killed in Ukraine, family says	Jordan Maclachlan, a 26-year-old volunteer and combat medic from Scotland, was killed on the front line in Ukraine on Jan. 3, BBC reported. &quot;Jordan always believed that he was making a difference, and we are all so proud of him helping others,&quot; his family said in a statement. The family is awaiting further details from the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), which confirmed to BBC it was supporting Maclachlan&apos;s family and coordinating with local authorities in Ukraine. &quot;Jordan was a fun-loving son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin, and a friend to many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him,&quot; the family said. Maclachlan is among several British volunteers who were killed while fighting for Ukraine against Russian aggression. In November, 22-year-old Callum Tindal-Draper, who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s foreign volunteer platoon, was also killed in combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/believed-he-was-making-a-difference-scottish-combat-medic-killed-in-ukraine-family-says/	2025-01-07T11:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_19-50-45.jpg

Ukraine secures return of 3 children from Russian-occupied territories, ombudsman says	Three Ukrainian children &#x2014; a 17-year-old boy and two younger boys &#x2014; have been returned from Russian-occupied regions to Ukraine-controlled territory, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets announced on Jan. 7. The 17-year-old faced persecution by Russian occupation authorities for his pro-Ukrainian stance and assistance to the Ukrainian army, according to Lubinets. &quot;He supported Ukraine under occupation and endured interrogations, threats, and intimidation from occupation representatives. Yet neither fear nor pressure broke his spirit,&quot; Lubinets said. The teenager is receiving humanitarian and financial support and preparing to continue his education in Ukraine. The two younger boys were separated from their mother, who fled Ukraine due to the war. Left in occupied Donetsk Oblast with their biological father, the boys were evacuated with the assistance of Lubinets&#x2019; office and reunited with their mother. &quot;Today, this family is safe and beginning the journey to heal the wounds of war,&quot; he said. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, almost 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted by Russia, according to the Children of War database. Fewer than 400 have been returned home. Investigations by the Financial Times and The Guardian revealed systemic efforts by Russian authorities to re-educate illegally deported children and, in some cases, place them for adoption through government-linked platforms. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia, in March 2023. The ICC wrote that it believes Putin &#x201C;bears individual criminal responsibility&#x201D; as the leader of Russia for the crimes committed against Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-3-children-from-russian-occupied-territories-ombudsman-says/	2025-01-07T10:00:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_18-16-04.jpg
US sanctions Orban ally Antal Rogan for corruption, abuse of power	The U.S. Treasury Department&#x2019;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Jan. 7 against Antal Rogan, a senior Hungarian government official and close associate of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Rogan is the first high-ranking Hungarian official sanctioned by the U.S. under the Magnitsky Act, which targets individuals involved in serious human rights abuses and corruption. Rogan, who serves as minister for the prime minister&#x2019;s Cabinet Office, oversees key government agencies, including the National Communications Office, the Digital Government Agency, and the Hungarian Tourism Agency. The U.S. Treasury Department accused Rogan of orchestrating schemes to control strategic sectors of Hungary&apos;s economy and diverting proceeds to himself and Fidesz party loyalists. &quot;Minister Rogan has played a central role in enabling a system in Hungary that has benefitted himself and his party at the expense of the Hungarian people,&quot; the statement said. The move comes amid growing criticism of Orban&apos;s government domestically and internationally. Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections on Jan. 1, citing Orban&#x2019;s declining popularity and widespread allegations of corruption. He accused Orban of turning Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; The Magnitsky Act, enacted in 2012, allows the U.S. to impose visa bans and asset freezes on individuals linked to corruption or human rights violations. To date, the U.S. has sanctioned 687 individuals under the Act.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-orban-ally-antal-rogan-for-corruption-abuse-of-power/	2025-01-07T09:38:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-sb10066698qn-001.jpg
Ukraine denies Slovakia's accusation of refusing gas transit talks	Ukraine rejected Slovakia&apos;s claims that it had refused to participate in trilateral talks with the EU and Slovakia on Russian gas transit. Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives were scheduled to meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the termination of the Russian gas transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko had planned to attend the Brussels discussions but was forced to stay in Kyiv due to urgent energy sector issues, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, told Politico on Jan. 7. Kyiv proposed holding the meeting online, but the European Commission suggested rescheduling for later, Chentsov said. According to Chentsov, Ukraine initiated the meeting to address Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s threats to halt electricity exports to Ukraine and cut support for Ukrainian refugees. &quot;Ukraine triggered the early warning mechanism on electricity supplies because of Fico&apos;s threats to stop the supplies, not gas transit talks,&quot; Chentsov said. Ukraine refused to prolong a natural gas transit agreement with Russia, which expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&apos;s war machine. Despite the EU&#x2019;s push to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains dependent on Russian gas, bound by a long-term contract with Gazprom, Moscow&apos;s state-owned energy giant. Switching to alternative supply routes could cost Slovakia an additional 220 million euros ($229 million) in transit fees, Fico claimed. Earlier on Jan. 7, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&apos;s economic challenges by halting Russian gas transit, leading to a 20% rise in natural gas prices on the European market. Alongside Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-denies-refusing-gas-transit-talks-blames-slovakia-for-misinformation-ambassador-says/	2025-01-07T09:14:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1242963522.jpg
Russia ‘delusional’ about its ability to sustain Ukraine war, says Latvian foreign minister	As Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine nears its fourth year, a worsening battlefield situation and the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency signal that the war could soon be entering a volatile and unpredictable endgame. In anticipation of a potential Trump-negotiated ceasefire, Kyiv is looking to its partners to help put Ukraine in the best possible position, but it still remains unclear whether or not European countries will be ready to take braver steps. &#xA0; With fresh memory of Russian occupation under the Soviet Union, the Baltic States have traditionally spoken with the most clarity on Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine among NATO countries. Consistently one of the top providers of military aid to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP, Latvia has entrenched the provision of at least 0.25% worth of its GDP to Ukraine in its state budget through 2026, and was also a founding member of the drone coalition.The Kyiv Independent spoke to Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze in Riga. This conversation is part of a series of interviews with decision-makers in the Nordic and Baltic countries conducted during the European screening tour of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s documentary film Can You Hear Me? The invisible battles of Ukrainian military medics. Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: How have you watched this year from here, from Latvia, from just across the border with Russia, and how decisive could these next few months be? Baiba Braze: It has been a year of decisions. It has been a year of our priorities, which were very clear: making sure that all the NATO countries on Russia&apos;s borders are safe and secure, and making sure that Ukraine is supported. For us, it&apos;s not about &#x201C;for as long as it takes,&#x201D; but actually looking at Ukraine&apos;s victory, which is to be defined by Ukraine, not by others. And, of course, limiting Russia&apos;s ability to gain military capabilities, constraining Russia politically and internationally. In all three priorities, we have done a lot and achieved quite a bit of progress. The allies&apos; presence here in the Baltic states has strengthened. Sweden joined NATO, following Finland last year, so that also has meant a lot in terms of regional plans, defense plans. In terms of capabilities, we have provided what we could to Ukraine ourselves and we have really encouraged and worked with the others to do maximum. We have worked internationally to ensure that there is a lot of support for Ukraine. We have provided support for energy infrastructure. As for Russia, obviously, it moved to the war economy much faster because it&apos;s an autocratic state. So they don&apos;t have to take into account what other countries think, what the population thinks, or what various interest groups think. They literally just throw thousands of people per day to death and there is very little accountability for that in Russia. Sanctions on our side have quite clearly meant that the Russian economy is really not doing well by all accounts. We can see that in data and analysis. What they are doing is pillaging the civilian economy, taking out from the civilian side of the economy everything that they need for the military and then they are trying to avoid the sanctions that have been imposed not only by the EU but also America, U.K., and other countries in the world. In Latvia, we created a system where it&apos;s very difficult to avoid sanctions. We are responsible not only for the exports of our capabilities but also for making sure that it doesn&apos;t go to third countries that could then re-export to Russia. Other countries in the EU have to do the same. All the exports have to be checked and there has to be a due diligence system for sanctions making sure that their exports don&apos;t reach countries in Central Asia and then go to Russia. That has not yet happened. That is, I think, for the next year, a very important objective to make sure that all the EU countries, all European countries have a due diligence system on sanctions in place. Plus, maintaining the pressure on the Russian economy, supplying Ukraine, and making sure that NATO is strong and united.

(Aleksander Kalka/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Working with the new U.S. administration is crucially important. But, on the battlefield, Ukraine is heroic. We speak to various institutions in Ukraine and I think it&apos;s crucially important to hold together and maintain this winter. For Russia, it&apos;s just getting more difficult. That&apos;s why they&apos;re so desperately trying to take some villages now. And, from the Nordic-Baltic side, we will continue supplying what we can, what we have, and we will encourage others to do that. I think that nobody wants Ukraine to be left alone in terms of aid or support. There&apos;s solidarity, there&apos;s everything. So, just be strong and know that you have so many friends and allies. That also concerns the wider future of Ukraine. You want to be in the EU and NATO. That is, of course, a guiding star for everything that Ukrainians do for the internal reforms, such as anti-corruption, and justice, which is as important. Because, in the end, Ukrainian people want peace, stability, security, prosperity, just like everybody else. The Kyiv Independent: Since the U.S. elections, the topic of peace negotiations has come up more and more recently, and President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine would be ready to end the fighting from their side without liberating all of its sovereign territory in exchange for NATO membership. Does Latvia share this opinion, is that the line that is taken in international discussions, or do you think there could be another alternative for a hard deterrence? Baiba Braze: The future of Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO is decided. There was a political decision, both in 2008 and at last year&apos;s Washington summit, that Ukraine&apos;s future in NATO is something that is not negotiable. But on the other hand, of course, with a war ongoing, what does it mean then to have security guarantees? What does it mean to be a member of NATO? Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war, because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody supports it and provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war. That&apos;s why there&#x2019;s a question of the borders, which borders, if the ceasefire applies or if there is a sort of stop in hostilities, then the questions about security guarantees or Article 5. None of these concepts are abstract, and I don&apos;t think people will be ready to discuss that much in public. I agree with President Zelensky that NATO membership is the best way for Ukraine, we support it, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an exchange for ceasefire or exchange for peace talks versus NATO membership. The Kyiv Independent: Do you think it&apos;s possible in the near term to reach this unified understanding that peace must come with a secure Ukraine, or can it be solved afterward? Baiba Bra&#x17E;e: The understanding is there because nobody wants some ceasefire which just lets Russia reconstitute and then start more of the war. That&apos;s in nobody&apos;s interest. But the stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger the position at the negotiation table. So that is a primary precondition of successful negotiations. It will also be very difficult if there is some type of settlement because we know from our experience that getting Russian troops out is very difficult. Nobody will recognize occupied territories as Russian. International law and Ukrainian international borders are what they are. It was the same with the Baltic states. We were occupied by the Soviets for 50 years, but neither the U.S. nor other Western countries recognized the occupation. We restored our independence, even though many people were saying, &#x201C;Oh, that&apos;s not possible, that&apos;s not going to happen, how can you think of a full regaining of independence?&#x201D; An aerial view of the graves of Ukrainian soldiers who died during the Ukraine-Russia War in the 18th cemetery in Kharkiv, Ukraine on May 21, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Primarily, we as people &#x2013; whether it&apos;s Latvians, Estonians or Lithuanians &#x2013; know what we want. We make our choices, and Ukraine is the same. Ukraine knows what it wants, and it makes its choices. And yes, fighting for the freedom and for the future, which is the future of a free country, is very difficult, and the losses and the situation on the battlefield are very difficult, but it&apos;s worth fighting for, in my view. The Kyiv Independent: Despite Russia&#x2019;s problems, Moscow keeps saying that they are against a freezing of the conflict under any circumstances. Maybe they see some kind of victory in their sights. How do you interpret that? Baiba Braze: I think it&apos;s, on one hand, delusional, ignoring the reality of the economy, of the real situation in Russia, and thinking that they can maintain this. On the other hand, it also shows their conviction that they have to take as much territory as soon as possible because that will make their position stronger. That&apos;s why we need to make sure that you are as strong as necessary, fighting for Ukraine&apos;s future, and showing the Russians that Ukrainians are not going to give up the fight. All those elements are as important, and of course, a very clear stance by the U.S. and by the Europeans and other powers in the world on saying that support for Ukraine will continue. Everybody has said that. And that is a powerful message and stance to the Kremlin that you might think that by taking a few villages you are winning, but your economy and the situation within Russia are showing something different, and Ukraine will continue to be supported. But again, the will of the Ukrainian people is the first precondition. It&apos;s crucially important to continue showing that there is a will to fight, to be free, to become members of the EU and NATO because nobody else is going to do that for you. Others will support it, but it&apos;s a Ukrainian fight. The Kyiv Independent: When it comes to establishing a real hard deterrence against a repeat invasion, if it&apos;s not NATO membership itself, more and more people have been talking about so-called boots on the ground, a physical presence of troops from NATO countries or even non-NATO partners inside Ukraine. Do you think that physical presence is required? Baiba Braze: I cannot discuss what is being discussed in classified conversations &#x2013; it would be highly irresponsible of me. Latvia hasn&apos;t made any decisions because it&apos;s not a decision-making time. If there is at some moment the ceasefire or the settlement that Ukraine is satisfied with, that there is a very clear understanding of how to enforce it, together with allies, I would imagine Latvia is not going to say no. But again, I don&apos;t have a mandate to say that currently because we are not there yet. So that would be highly irresponsible to sort of suggest something. But the sort of very strong message that we transmit to everyone and that we as Nordic-Baltic countries discuss and stand for is Ukraine first, that Ukraine&apos;s strength, Ukraine&apos;s supply is a battle. The political support, the future in the EU and NATO is something that we are devoting all that we can to in terms of political support, money, and resources. But without Ukraine&apos;s leadership, without Ukraine&apos;s will, without Ukraine&apos;s standing for itself, nobody is going to replace that. So that is the first sort of leading light that we all look up to.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-a-ukrainian-fight-latvian-foreign-minister-on-the-road-to-a-just-peace-in-russias-war/	2025-01-07T08:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2150161479.jpg
Hungary's FM criticizes Ukraine for gas transit halt, claims 20% rise in gas prices	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&apos;s economic challenges by halting Russian gas transit, leading to a 20% rise in natural gas prices on the European market, in a post published on Facebook on Jan. 7. Ukraine refused to prolong an agreement with Russia on Russian natural gas transit through its territory that expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. While the EU has worked to reduce reliance on Russian fossil fuels, countries like Hungary and Slovakia remain dependent on Russian gas. Szijjarto criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s actions, claiming they put the European economy, particularly Central Europe, in a difficult position. &quot;Although Ukraine is trying to join the EU as a candidate for membership, with its latest decision, it has once again put the European economy in a difficult situation,&quot; he said. He also claimed that Hungary has diversified its energy sources and will not be significantly affected by rising prices. Hungary annually imports approximately 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas under a 15-year agreement signed in 2021. Alongside Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions. Szijjarto said he had met with Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar to analyze the situation and emphasized that Ukraine must uphold its EU association agreement, which includes commitments to maintain energy transportation routes. Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives were scheduled to meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the transit shutdown. However, the meeting was canceled. While Slovakia claimed that Ukraine refused to participate, Kyiv refuted the claim. Since Ukraine&apos;s energy minister was forced to stay in Ukraine due to the &quot;difficult situation in the energy sector,&quot; he suggested holding the discussions online, Kyiv said. &#xA0;The European Commission said it was working to reschedule the talks and affirmed that the EU energy market remains stable despite the transit halt. Hungary, seen as the EU&#x2019;s most Moscow-friendly member, has repeatedly blocked sanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine. Szijjarto has continued to visit Russia throughout the war, setting Hungary apart from other EU nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-fm-criticizes-ukraine-for-gas-transit-halt-claims-economic-harm/	2025-01-07T07:40:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Ukraine hits Russia's infantry brigade command post in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian soldiers struck on Jan. 7 the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade near the village of Belaya in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff claimed. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 100 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. &quot;Such fire damage is an integral part of combat operations of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces units, which are engaged in combat operations on the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; the statement read. No further details on the attack and the extent of the damage were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Another Russian command post came under Ukraine&apos;s attack in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, on Jan. 2, according to the military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russias-infantry-brigade-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-07T06:54:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Ukraine's military refutes claims of Russia taking Kharkiv Oblast village	A military spokesperson on Jan. 7 denied reports of Russia taking the village of Lozova in Kharkiv Oblast, saying there had not even been any &quot;serious clashes&quot; in the area at the time. Located in Ukraine&apos;s northeast, Lozova lies near the administrative borders with Luhansk Oblast and around 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the front-line town of Kupiansk. The crowdsourced war-monitoring DeepState map showed that the Russian military recently took the village. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. &quot;It&apos;s hard for me to determine where the information about its capture came from. The information (coming in) from that place is contradictory. There is not even information about serious clashes there as of now,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television. DeepState is an independent mapping project with close ties to the Defense Ministry. It is widely trusted as one of the most reliable sources of accurate information on territorial changes along the front line. As Ukraine ended 2024 with an unsolved manpower shortage and setbacks in several key battles, Russian units are gaining ground incrementally in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-refutes-claims-of-russia-taking-kharkiv-oblast-village/	2025-01-07T06:01:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1749127943.jpg
Ukraine says it holds Kurakhove's western outskirts despite Russia's claim of capture	Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast and a local power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult,&quot; a military spokesperson said on Jan. 7. &quot;The situation in Kurakhove is really quite difficult right now, because a significant part of the city has been destroyed,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 7, only a day after Russia claimed to have full control over the town. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. &quot;Ukrainian troops are holding on the western part of the town, its western outskirts. They are also holding onto a power plant located in the town,&quot; Trehubov added. According to the spokesperson, Russian forces are attempting to raze Kurakhove building by building, destroying any potential defenses for Ukrainian soldiers. This method mirrors Russian tactics used in other front-line towns like Toretsk, where there are reportedly &quot;no intact buildings left&quot; after Moscow&apos;s onslaught. In its Jan. 7 report, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported fending off 26 Russian assaults in the Kurakhove sector, including in the area of the town itself. The DeepState monitoring group shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, save for small areas in the west. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts at Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-holds-kurakhoves-western-outskirts-despite-russias-claim-of-capture/	2025-01-07T05:41:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172110304.jpg
Northern European coalition steps up undersea monitoring amid sabotage, Russian shadow fleet concerns	The U.K-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has set up a tracking system to alert allies if a ship poses a threat to undersea cable infrastructure and to monitor Russia&apos;s shadow fleet of tankers, London said on Jan. 7. The JEF is a coalition of 10 northern European NATO countries. The decision comes after several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea were damaged over the past six months, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. The new Nordic Warden system monitors ships in real-time and alerts JEF and NATO allies if a vessel behaves suspiciously. Its database also contains tankers that are part of Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage, Sweden said. &quot;Nordic Warden will help protect against both deliberate acts of sabotage as well as cases of extreme negligence which we have seen cause damage to underwater cables,&quot; U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said in a statement. Parallel to the Nordic Warden operation, NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. Allied officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-led-coalition-steps-up-undersea-monitoring/	2025-01-07T05:04:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Ukrainians' trust in Zelensky dropped to 52% during 2024, poll shows	Some 52% of Ukrainians trust President Volodymyr Zelensky, a drop of seven percentage points from October 2024 and 12 points from February, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 7. In turn, 39% of respondents said they trust the president. The poll, conducted between Dec. 2 and 17 last year, comes as Russia&apos;s all-out war nears its third anniversary while Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Trust in Zelensky, dealing with growing unpopularity before February 2022, skyrocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and the president remained in Kyiv to lead the country&apos;s resistance, earlier KIIS surveys showed. The figures began to drop in 2024 as the battlefield stalemate gave way to Russian tactical advances, though most Ukrainians maintained their trust in Zelensky throughout the year. Zelensky is seen more favorably in the western (60%) and central (52%) regions of the country and less so in the southern (46%) and eastern (42%) regions. Ukraine&apos;s south and east have been the most affected by Russia&apos;s war. The survey&apos;s results were based on telephone interviews with 2,000 respondents residing in Ukraine-controlled territories. Other recent sociological surveys point to moderate but consistent growth of pessimism among the Ukrainian population toward the war&apos;s progress. In another KIIS survey from December 2024, around 38% of respondents said they were open to territorial concessions in exchange for peace, a notable increase from 19% a year earlier. Expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 are mounting as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-trust-in-zelensky-mildly-drops-to-52-poll-shows/	2025-01-07T04:41:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Russian Patriarch Kirill bashes West during Orthodox Christmas celebrations	Moscow Patriarch Kirill accused the West of &quot;hating&quot; Russia because it represents &quot;an alternative path of civilizational development.&quot; He made the comments during the celebration of the Christmas Mass on Jan. 7. Patriarch Kirill (born Vladimir Gundyayev) has been a close ally of Putin, praising his rule as a &quot;gift from God&quot; and publicly supporting the war against Ukraine, subsequently straining relations with other Orthodox churches. &quot;We are hated (by the West) because we offer a different path, an alternative path of civilizational development,&quot; the head of the Russian Orthodox Church told the faithful during his sermon. Orthodox Christians in Russia celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7 in accordance with the Julian calendar. In 2023, Ukraine signed a law moving the day of Christmas celebrations to Dec. 25, similar to Western Christianity. During the mass, Kirill blessed icons and crosses that were engraved with Putin&apos;s initials and will be sent to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media. &quot;Physically, they cannot really smother us, though they try through different types of slander and the creation of blocs of some sort intended to weaken Russia,&quot; Kirill said, according to Reuters. The Russian religious leader often bashes the West for what he presents as &quot;moral decadence,&quot; primarily attacking LGBTQ rights that are increasingly suppressed in Russia. Ukraine placed Kirill on its wanted list in December 2023 after accusing him of infringing on Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity resulting in &quot;the death of people or other serious consequences.&quot; The charge carries a punishment of life imprisonment. Last August, the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill banning activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, which has been linked to the Russian church, and many of its members have been accused of collaboration or sympathies with Russia. Most Ukrainian Orthodox Christians adhere to a separate and autonomous Orthodox Church of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-head-of-church-bashes-west-during-orthodox-christmas-celebrations/	2025-01-07T04:02:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1240189228.jpg
In historic record, Ukrainian F-16 pilot downs 6 cruise missiles in single mission, Air Force claims	For the first time in the history of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a Ukrainian-operated jet shot down six Russian cruise missiles during a single mission in December, including two with the aircraft cannon, the Air Force claimed on Jan. 7. The interception reportedly took place during a mass Russian aerial strike on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024, which saw Russia deploy almost 200 drones and 94 missiles. &quot;For the first time in the history of the Fighting Falcon, an F-16 fighter jet destroyed six Russian cruise missiles in one combat mission,&quot; the Air Force Command said on social media. Ukraine has received a number of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them multiple times in air defense roles during Russian mass strikes on cities and infrastructure. &quot;They say that even Americans couldn&apos;t believe you did it,&quot; Air Force Command spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with the pilot, whose identity was not revealed. The aviator said that he approached a group of cruise missiles and, despite their electronic warfare countermeasures, managed to lock on to targets. The F-16 reportedly shot down one pair of Russian projectiles with medium-range missiles and then another pair with short-range missiles. An undated photo of a Ukrainian pilot published by the Air Force Command.Ukrainian F-16s are equipped with four air-to-air medium-range and short-range missiles. Without missiles and low on fuel, the pilot was then recalled from the area but spotted another missile heading toward Kyiv. He moved to intercept it and opened fire from his aircraft cannon against the projectile, which was flying over 650 kilometers per hour, a difficult and risky maneuver, the Air Force said. &quot;A few bursts from the cannon &#x2014; and an explosion... then another one! &apos;A secondary detonation,&apos; I thought, but, as it turned out, there were two missiles,&quot; the pilot said, adding he did everything as taught by U.S. instructors. According to the Air Force Command, Ukrainian pilots have learned how to shoot down missiles with aircraft cannons in simulators in the U.S. but have never attempted it during actual combat before. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered into service in late 1978, and its various versions have been used by over two dozen countries, including the U.S. and its European allies. More than 4,600 F-16s have been built, and the platform has been deployed in multiple conflicts worldwide.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-f-16-pilot-downs-6-cruise-missiles/	2025-01-07T03:16:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218520.jpg
FPV drones launched from naval drone struck Russian air defenses for first time, Ukraine says	For the first time, Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones using a naval drone as a springboard took out three Russian air defense systems, Ukraine&#x2019;s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security said on Jan. 7. &quot;Only a week after Ukrainian sea drones made history by successfully taking down Russian helicopters, another historical first as our homegrown naval drones are now launching their own FPV drones, destroying Russia&apos;s air defense units,&quot; the government agency said on social media. As a result of the attack on Jan. 6, two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were reportedly damaged or destroyed in the occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s southern Kherson Oblast. The strikes were carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Navy, which released a video of the attack against one of the Pantsir systems. The Kyiv Independent could not establish the extent of damage dealt to Russian air defenses. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. The attack came a week after Ukrainian Magura V5 naval drones hit three Russian Mi-8 helicopters, downing two of them over the Black Sea in another strike that was also the first of its kind. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in February ordering the creation of a separate branch of the Armed Forces for drones, called Unmanned Systems Forces, to command the rapidly evolving drone warfare in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Cheaper to operate and more precise than most artillery systems, drones quickly became one of the main tools for Ukraine to fend off Russia&#x2019;s assaults amid chronic artillery ammunition shortages.	https://kyivindependent.com/fpv-drones-launched-from-naval-drone-struck-russian-air-defenses-for-first-time-ukraine-says/	2025-01-07T02:12:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1957348817.jpg
Europe might soon feel ‘intense pressure’ to strike a deal with Moscow, Polish FM warns	Europe might soon feel &quot;intense pressure&quot; to reach some sort of an agreement with Russia regarding its war against Ukraine, Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a post on X on Jan. 6. His words came only two weeks before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. &quot;We could soon face intense pressure to strike a deal with Moscow,&quot; Sikorski wrote after delivering a speech for French ambassadors in Paris. &quot;But what kind of deal would a sensible Europe accept? Certainly not an ordinary deal that would allow Moscow to regain its strength. Europe is much stronger than Russian leaders believe. Russia is much weaker than many Europeans believe,&quot; he added. Despite mounting economic challenges at home, Russian leaders have shown little interest in a peace deal and rejected reported proposals from Trump&apos;s team. Moscow&apos;s troops currently hold the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing in Donetsk Oblast and chipping away at Ukraine&apos;s positions in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Ukraine deserves peace, needs peace. But it should be peace on fair terms, not capitulation,&quot; the Polish foreign minister wrote, adding that Europe should help position Kyiv to be in the best possible shape ahead of entering negotiations with Moscow. Zelensky recently said that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, noting that the war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that Ukraine should prepare for &quot;realistic&quot; discussions on territory, warning there will not be a &quot;quick and easy solution&quot; to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-might-soon-feel-intense-pressure-to-strike-a-deal-with-moscow-polish-fm-warns/	2025-01-07T01:40:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgoOthOXkAAR2TH.jpeg
Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast fend off almost 100 Russian assaults in a day, military says	Ukrainian forces repelled 94 Russian ground assaults in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 7 amid escalating hostilities in the region. This represents nearly half of the skirmishes over the past day, as the military reported 218 clashes across the front. On Jan. 5, Ukraine launched renewed offensive operations in the Russian region, which is seen as crucial for any possible peace negotiations. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims and provided limited information on the operation. The U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that between Jan. 5 and 6, Ukrainian forces advanced in southern Berdin, central Russkoye Porechnoye, and central Novosotnitsky, all northeast of Sudzha, a key Ukraine-held town in the region. The ISW analysts speculated that these attacks &quot;may be the beginning stages of a concerted Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast or elsewhere in the theater.&quot; In the meantime, Russian forces took advantage of Ukrainian activity to attack elsewhere in the Kursk Oblast salient, apparently advancing west of Malaya Loknya, according to the ISW. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia. Prospects of negotiations in 2025 are hotly discussed amid U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pledges to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-fends-off-almost-100-russian-assaults-in-kursk-oblast-military-reports/	2025-01-07T01:12:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2174856030.jpg
Umerov appoints ex-Infrastructure Minister Kubrakov as his advisor to tackle logistics	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has appointed former Vice Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov as his advisor &quot;on a voluntary basis,&quot; Umerov announced on Jan. 7. Kubrakov had headed the Infrastructure Ministry since May 2021 before being dismissed in May 2024 for unclear reasons. While his dismissal was formally justified by the restructuring of Kubrakov&apos;s ministry, Ukrainska Pravda reported that the former minister fell out of favor with the Presidential Office. The ex-minister&apos;s &quot;experience as the deputy prime minister, the infrastructure minister, and head of Ukravtodor (the State Agency of Automobile Roads) is important and will help improve the supply and logistics in the Armed Forces,&quot; Umerov said on the Defense Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The appointment comes amid wide-ranging calls for military reforms as Ukraine&apos;s army is increasingly on the back foot in its war against Russia. Last week, Umerov announced a comprehensive review of the Ground Forces Command to evaluate management structures, processes, and compliance with legislation to support reforms and enhance battlefield effectiveness.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-appoints-kubrakov-as-his-advisor/	2025-01-07T00:33:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/kubrakov.jpg
Putin sends trusted general to fend off Ukraine’s offensive in Kursk	Russia sent one of its top generals, General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, to organize Russia&#x2019;s defense in Kursk Oblast against a renewed Ukrainian attack, The Telegraph reported on Jan. 5. Ukrainian troops recently launched a renewed offensive against Russian forces in Kursk Oblast in an apparent attempt to halt Moscow&#x2019;s effort to retake the region before Donald Trump takes office and possible negotiations begin. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian forces were stopped, and their primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims and provided limited information on the operation. General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov has been serving as the Kremlin&#x2019;s deputy defense minister and was tasked to head Russia&#x2019;s border defenses and lead Moscow&#x2019;s mercenary projects in Africa. According to the Telegraph, he was sent to Kursk Oblast &quot;hours&quot; after Ukraine began its maneuvers on Jan. 5. The general also survived an assassination attempt with life-threatening injuries while serving as the Kremlin-backed president of Ingushetia, one of Russia&apos;s most unstable regions. Ukrainian troops made a surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, capturing about 1,300 square kilometers of territory as a potential bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Although Kyiv has since lost control of half of the initially seized area, fighting in the region remains intense.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-sends-trusted-general-to-fend-off-ukraines-offensive-in-kursk/	2025-01-07T00:10:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1242524435-1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 23 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least 23 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 7. Russia launched 38 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Twenty-eight drones were shot down, and 10 were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another injured during a Russian attack against the town of Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two civilians were also injured in Rivne in the Pokrovsk district and one in Rodynske, according to the governor. A 61-year-old woman was injured during a Russian attack against the village of Zolochiv in Kharkiv Oblast, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and 17 injured in Russian attacks, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. This included a 50-year-old man killed and at least five women aged between 30 and 58 injured when a Russian drone dropped explosives on a bus in Kherson. One civilian suffered injuries during a Russian rocket attack against the Bilopillia community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-115/	2025-01-06T23:35:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_08-42-12.jpg
Russian forces attempt to 'infiltrate' settlements around Pokrovsk, Ukraine's military says	Small Russian units are attempting to advance around Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the town itself is not threatened at the moment, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said on Jan. 6. Russia has been focusing its efforts on Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the region, advancing within only a few kilometers south of the town as civilian residents flee. &quot;The Pokrovsk sector has been one of the hottest parts of the front for the last four weeks, maybe longer,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television. &quot;But they (Russian forces) are currently unable to achieve such a success as to threaten Porkovsk itself.&quot; Trehubov claimed that Moscow&apos;s troops are unable to take the town &quot;in pincers&quot; but are attempting to &quot;infiltrate&quot; surrounding settlements. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 6, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Russian units are &quot;trying to bypass (Pokrovsk) in one way or another, clinging to individual houses in individual settlements,&quot; the spokesperson said. The DeepState monitoring group shows Russian forces less than 3 kilometers (less than 2 miles) south of the town and largely in control of several nearby settlements like Svehchenko and Dachenske. Moscow&apos;s troops appear to be advancing not only directly from the south but also from the southwest through Pishchane and from the southeast from the direction of Mykolaivka. Several Ukrainian positions in the surrounding settlements have been destroyed by Russian fire and advances, and Kyiv&apos;s forces are &quot;taking measures to prevent the deterioration of the situation,&quot; the Khortytsia group said on Telegram on Jan. 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia has advanced swiftly in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. After capturing Vuhledar last October, Russia claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had taken Kurakhove. Fighting is also ongoing within the towns of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Ukraine finds itself increasingly on the back foot as its military faces manpower shortages. The battlefield situation is likely to play a crucial role in the year to come amid U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s calls for peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attempt-to-infiltrate-settlements-around-pokrovsk-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-06T23:03:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 800,010 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 800,010 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 7. This number includes 1,970 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,710 tanks, 20,189 armored fighting vehicles, 33,226 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,710 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,038 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,708 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-800-010-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-06T22:25:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/1_Petrasiuk_1.JPG
French official confirms 'dozens' of Ukrainian soldiers deserted while training in France, AFP reports	A French army official confirmed to AFP on Jan. 6 that several dozen Ukrainian soldiers serving in the 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade deserted while undergoing military training in France. &quot;There have been a certain number of desertions, but they remain very marginal given the volume of people who have undergone training,&quot; the unnamed official told AFP. &quot;They were in French barracks, they had the right to go out,&quot; the added. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. The brigade has become plagued with controversy after media reports emerged of desertion and widespread mismanagement in recent days. A media investigation conducted by Ukrainian publication Censor.net claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. Yurii Butusov, the publication&apos;s chief editor, claimed about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces, acknowledged significant challenges within the French-trained brigade, including high desertion rates and poor organization in a press conference on Jan. 6. &quot;There are problems, and there were problems in staffing, training, and partially in the command staff,&quot; Drapatyi said. &quot;This is all consciously analyzed, and certain conclusions have been drawn.&quot; Following the emergence of media reports, Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation on Jan. 2 launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority. On Jan. 5, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered to boost the brigade with drones amid the reports. The report comes amid growing calls for reform within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership as Kyiv grapples with intensifying pressure in its war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-official-confirms-dozens-of-ukrainian-soldiers-deserted-while-training-in-france-afp-reports/	2025-01-06T20:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246365005-m-1674723833vz7l2.jpeg
Incoming Ukraine peace envoy postpones visit to Kyiv until after Trump's inauguration, Reuters reports	The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has postponed a visit to Kyiv until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing four sources with knowledge of the trip. According to the sources who spoke to Reuters, the new date has not yet been set, and it was not immediately clear as to why the trip was postponed. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously confirmed to journalists in Brussels on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Dec. 20 that Ukraine and the U.S. had initially reached a preliminary agreement on the date of a visit to Kyiv by Kellogg &#x2014; although that date was never publicly revealed. Reuters reported on Dec. 18 that Kellogg planned to visit Kyiv and several European capitals before Trump takes office on Jan. 20 as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Sources confirmed on Jan. 6 that Kellogg remains committed to visiting other European capitals, including Rome and Paris. Kellogg, a former national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, is a known figure to Ukraine and &quot;has maintained close ties... in recent years&quot; with Kyiv, Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-peace-envoy-postpones-visit-to-kyiv-until-after-inauguration-reuters-reports/	2025-01-06T19:17:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
Head of Ukraine's Customs Service suspected of failing to declare over $100,000 in assets	Law enforcement agents are investigating Serhiy Zvyagintsev, the interim head of Ukraine&apos;s State Customs Service, over suspicions that Zvyagintsev failed to declare a home near Kyiv, that has been evaluated to be worth over $100,000, the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said on Jan. 6. Investigators believe that Zvyagintsev and his family are the actual owners of a 236 square meter home, as well as an adjacent plot of land, on the outskirts of Kyiv that is registered under Zvyagintsev&apos;s father-in-law. Investigators allege that Zvyagintsev failed to declare the assets between 2021 and 2023. The system of compulsory asset declarations was originally instituted as part of the country&apos;s fight against corruption following the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution. At the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, the requirement for submitting e-declarations was suspended. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law in October 2023 to resume asset declarations for officials and immediately make them publicly accessible. Ukraine&apos;s National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) re-opened access to the asset declaration system in December 2023. An investigation, conducted by NABU as well as the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) is ongoing as Zvyagintsev faces charges under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code.	https://kyivindependent.com/head-of-ukraines-customs-service-suspected-of-failing-to-declare-over-100-000-in-assets/	2025-01-06T18:01:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-117865212-d3152b21-cf3e-4467-9046-10e32883c3b8.jpg
Kyiv, Moscow reach preliminary agreement to prioritize wounded POWs in future exchanges	Ukraine and Russia have reached a &quot;preliminary agreement&quot; to conduct regular prisoner exchanges throughout the year, focusing on the return of seriously ill and severely wounded prisoners of war (POWs), Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets announced on Jan. 6. In an interview with the state-run parliamentary broadcaster Rada, Lubinets expressed hope that Russia would honor its commitment. &quot;I do not want this to come across as an official announcement just yet. But we will see if the Russian side keeps its word. If they do, Ukrainian society will notice the systematic nature in terms of quantity, timing, and categories [of prisoners returning home].&quot; Under the revised approach for preparing exchange lists, priority will now go to those who are severely injured or critically ill, followed by prisoners who have been in captivity the longest. &quot;For the first time, we managed to establish that we will create lists primarily based on physical health,&quot; Lubinets added. In 2024, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 3,956 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the numbers in his New Year video address published late on Dec. 31. On Dec. 30, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 189 captives from Russian detention, including military personnel and two civilians. The coordination headquarters described it as one of the largest exchanges since the start of the full-scale war. Among those freed were defenders of Azovstal, Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Snake Island, and other key front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-moscow-reach-preliminary-agreement-to-prioritize-wounded-pows-in-future-exchanges/	2025-01-06T15:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1988735177.jpg
Zelensky says nearly 15,000 Russians have been killed in Kursk region	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 that Russian forces had sustained significant losses over five months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk region. &quot;During the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost 38,000 of their soldiers in this direction alone, with nearly 15,000 of these losses being irreversible,&quot; Zelensky added in his evening address. He did not provide evidence to support the figures he cited for Russian casualties, so the Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the information. The Kursk region lies on the border with Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast, which has been experiencing daily attacks since Russian troops were pushed out of the oblast and back across the border in April 2022. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in the Kursk region in early August, capturing sections of the territory. However, the Russian military claims it has regained control over much of that land. On Jan. 5, Ukraine reported initiating a new offensive in the area but shared limited information about it. Reports from Ukrainian and Western sources suggest that around 11,000 North Korean troops are aiding Russian forces in the region. Russia has not confirmed or denied their involvement. The Russian Defense Ministry reported on Monday that Ukrainian forces were stopped, and their primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Zelensky highlighted the creation of a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the Kursk region, where Russia had stationed substantial military reinforcements. According to him, this development has hindered Moscow&#x2019;s ability to deploy those forces to critical battlefronts in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Importantly, the (Russian forces) cannot now direct all this strength to our other directions, particular to Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia oblasts,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-nearly-15-000-russians-have-been-killed-in-kursk-region/	2025-01-06T13:56:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166323213.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes 3 Russian air defense systems in single day; 3,800 North Korean troops killed, injured in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 6: Two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged or destroyed by Ukraine&apos;s Navy in one day, the military branch claimed on Jan. 6. &quot;Our soldiers continue to turn Russian equipment into scrap metal,&quot; Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said in a Facebook post referring to the three successful attacks. In his post, Neizhpapa shared a video apparently depicting a drone zeroing in on a Russian Pantsir-S1 vehicle, claiming that the two Pantsir-S1 were destroyed in the occupied territory of Ukraine&#x2019;s Kherson Oblast. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show a Ukrainian strike against a Russian Pantsir air defense system. Footage published on Jan. 6, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s Navy/Telegram)Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the Navy&apos;s claims nor the extent of the damage done to the Russian anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. Russia has lost 1,034 air defense systems since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported before the news of the three successful hits surfaced. A total of 3,800 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded by Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. Pyongyang sent upwards of 12,000 North Korean soldiers into Kursk Oblast in the fall of 2024, amid an agreement to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region which began on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Zelensky, in his wide-ranging interview with Lex Fridman, added that Pyongyang has the capabilities to bring additional North Korean troops to the front, as many as 30,000 -40,000 troops. Ukraine reportedly ramped up its operations in Kursk Oblast with a new offensive on Jan. 5, with mixed reports surfacing on outcome of the renewed push from Kyiv. The renewed offensive comes amid significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes, Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect &#x2014; amounting to high casualty totals. Kirby added that North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Ukraine and Russia are rushing to make up ground in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes power on Jan. 2o. Trump has previously said he would end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; with potential peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. The comments come as Ukraine has steadily lost ground in the region amid Russian counterattacks. Ukraine has reportedly lost over 40% of territory it previously gained in due to renewed Russian efforts. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia, the AFP news agency reported. The Biden administration, whose term expires in a few weeks, has sped up the delivery of military assistance to Ukraine to put Kyiv in the strongest possible position in potential peace negotiations. &quot;Their (Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; Blinken told reporters in Seoul. The comments come at the heels of reports of Ukraine launching new offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after months of being on the defensive. Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion in early August, allegedly seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Moscow has deployed reinforcements, including thousands of North Korean soldiers, and reportedly recaptured around half of the lost territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky also called the Kursk incursion an important &quot;trump card&quot; in any potential talks. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Trump&apos;s return to the White House sparked concerns among Ukraine&apos;s allies due to the president-elect&apos;s past criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s support for Kyiv. In comments made since his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the country, instead aiming to leverage Washington&apos;s aid to push Russia to negotiate. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously offered U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Ukraine to buy American weapons at the expense of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;This is one of the security guarantees. Take the money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States. We don&apos;t need gifts from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview with Fridman. &quot;It will be very good for your industry. For the United States. We will put money there. Russian money. Not Ukrainian. Not European. Russian money. Russian assets. They have to pay for this,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky did not comment on Trump&apos;s reaction to the suggestion. Trump and his team have been critical of U.S. spending to support Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&apos;s appointed National Security Advisor for his upcoming term said on Dec. 15 that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy.&quot; Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. Zelensky has taken steps to foster a positive relationship with Trump, despite previously having a fraught relationship stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial. The two leaders met on Sept. 27 in the midst of the U.S. presidential election campaign. They met again on the sidelines of the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Dec. 7. &quot;He (Trump) is strong... He is young... and his brains work,&quot; Zelensky said when asked why he thinks Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. Shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko apologized to President Volodymyr Zelensky over the country&apos;s involvement in the war, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;A few days into the war, I spoke with Lukashenko on the phone, and he apologized... he said, &apos;It was not me, missiles were launched from my territory, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was the one launching them.&apos; These are his words, I have witnesses,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview. &quot;&apos;And I apologize,&apos; he said. &apos;But believe me&apos; &#x2014; that&apos;s what he told me &#x2014; &apos;Volodya (referring to Volodymyr Zelensky), this is not me. I&#x2019;m not in charge,&apos;&quot; Zelensky added. In response, Zelensky said that he called Lukashenko &quot;a murderer,&quot; questioning why Lukashenko allowed Russia to launch missiles at Ukraine from Belarusian territory. Lukashenko became increasingly reliant on Russia after isolating Belarus from the West, following Belarus&apos; 2020 election. Lukashenko&apos;s opposition and the West condemned the results as fraudulent. Lukashenko cracked down on mass protests that broke out in response to the fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory. Lukashenko asked Putin on Dec. 6 to deploy the Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, a weapon Russia recently used to strike Ukraine, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. As many as 10 missile systems will be deployed, according to pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev. Belarus will be holding its next presidential election on Jan. 26 where Lukashenko is expected to be handed a seventh term in office. The energy crisis in Transnistria, triggered by Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 cutoff of gas supplies, is part of a broader Russian plan to manipulate and spread propaganda, Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Voda said on Jan. 6. &quot;Russian propaganda tries to create a story in which Moldova becomes a &#x2018;problematic actor,&#x2019; although the government has proposed clear solutions to avoid the crisis,&quot; he said. Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant, halted gas deliveries to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials disputed these claims, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the early 1990s, relies heavily on Russian gas and has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. Voda said the crisis reflects Russia&apos;s deliberate effort to create fear and unrest. &quot;This energy crisis is more than an economic problem &#x2014; it is part of a larger Russian plan of manipulation and propaganda designed to create fear and discontent on both banks of the Dnister.&quot; Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot; The spokesperson criticized the refusal, calling it a failure to &quot;cooperate for the benefit of the people.&quot; Russian propaganda has sought to blame Chisinau for the crisis, alleging that Moldovan authorities intentionally caused power outages to punish the region, Voda said. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies through Romania, Transnistria remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. French President Emmanuel Macron on Jan. 6 called on Ukraine to have &quot;realistic discussions on territorial issues&quot; as they alone can conduct them. &quot;There will be no quick and easy solution in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said in an address to French ambassadors in the Elysee Palace. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has previously vowed to bring both sides to the negotiating table and swiftly end the war. &quot;The U.S. must help us to change the nature of the situation and convince Russia to come to the negotiating table,&quot; Macron said in comments quoted by France24. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military currently lacks the strength to retake all of it by force, noting that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. In his address, the French head of state warned of repercussions for Europe and the U.S. should Ukraine emerge from the war on the losing side. &quot;The new American president himself knows that the U.S. has no chance of winning anything if Ukraine loses,&quot; Macron said. France&apos;s president also said that it would be up to European countries to &quot;build security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, a statement in line with his calls for greater European strategic autonomy. Paris has spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers to Ukraine after a possible ceasefire deal is reached. Trump, who vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict, has reportedly backed the idea, while Russia has rejected it. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, Ukraine&apos;s military setbacks, and Russia&apos;s growing economic difficulties have contributed to expectations of possible peace talks in 2025. Kyiv&apos;s allies have said they seek to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for any possible negotiations, with German government saying on Jan. 6 that peace cannot be &quot;dictated&quot; from Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-3-russian-air-defense-systems-in-single-day-3-800-north-korean-troops-killed-or-injured-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-06T12:26:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Picture1.png
Negative lesson' — Ground Forces chief acknowledges desertions, mismanagement in French-trained brigade	Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces, acknowledged significant challenges within the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, including high desertion rates and poor organization, during a Jan. 6 press conference. &quot;Of course, this is a negative lesson, a negative experience, but it should be converted into some kind of preventative action,&quot; Drapatyi said. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The 155th Brigade, formed with support from Ukraine&#x2019;s Western partners, was intended to be a flagship project to train new military units equipped with heavy weaponry. French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s announcement in June that France would provide training and military supplies was part of this initiative. The brigade was meant to consist of about 5,800 troops, but fewer than 2,000 have undergone training in France. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, pointed to problems in the creation and management of the brigade allegedly leading to 1,700 cases of soldiers going AWOL from the unit before it fired a shot. According to Butusov, the failure to provide critical equipment, such as drones and electronic warfare tools, hampered the brigade&#x2019;s combat readiness when it was deployed in November. &quot;There are problems, and there were problems in staffing, training, and partially in the command staff,&quot; Drapatyi said. &quot;This is all consciously analyzed, and certain conclusions have been drawn.&quot; The general added that lessons learned from these difficulties are being used to improve the brigade and avoid similar issues in the future. Drapatyi acknowledged these challenges, pointing out that desertion was often driven by fear and a lack of combat experience. &quot;There are many manifestations of unauthorized abandonment of military units, but there are also reasons for this,&quot; he said. &quot;There is the fear of the personnel [...], and sometimes the lack of practical experience in combat operations.&quot; Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served less than two months, according to the Censor.net investigation. The commander emphasized that the military is actively addressing the brigade&#x2019;s issues. &quot;I confirm that there were problematic issues with the command staff and the training process, and they are all being resolved now,&quot; he said. Despite the challenges, Drapatyi remained optimistic about the brigade&#x2019;s future. &quot;The brigade is developing, fighting, inflicting losses on the enemy,&quot; he said. The report comes amid growing calls for reform within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership as Kyiv grapples with intensifying pressure in its war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/negative-lesson-ukraines-ground-forces-chief-acknowledges-desertions-mismanagement-in-french-trained-brigade/	2025-01-06T11:40:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2113280448.jpg
Zelensky takes on Putin apologists, US skeptics on 3-hour Lex Fridman podcast	In a newly released three-hour interview, Moscow-born U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman tried to persuade President Volodymyr Zelensky that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &#x201C;a serious person who loves his country.&quot; &#x201C;He loves his inner circle. It&#x2019;s only a small part of the people. He doesn&apos;t love (the Russian people),&#x201D; Zelensky countered. &#x201C;You cannot send your people to another land to die, knowing that they will die. The boys he sends (to fight in Ukraine) are 18-years-old. They are children. It&#x2019;s not that fascists came to his land, and he needs to defend it &#x2014; he came to ours, and he sent them.&#x201D; With nearly five million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Fridman organized an interview with Zelensky that was published on Jan. 5 as part of what he described as his &#xA0;&#x201C;small part in pushing for peace.&#x201D; Fridman&#x2019;s show has previously hosted controversial figures, including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk, political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, all of whom have advanced narratives portraying Ukraine as a corrupt nation bent on escalating war with Russia. In this context, Zelensky&#x2019;s appearance on Fridman&#x2019;s podcast appeared to be a savvy move aimed at reaching a segment of the Western audience misinformed about the realities of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Throughout the interview, Zelensky navigated Fridman&#x2019;s idealized view of Ukraine-Russia relations &#x2014; sometimes through a slew of curse words &#x2014; including the idea that Ukrainians would forgive Russians in the near future, and that the two nations could return to a semblance of their former &#x201C;brotherly&#x201D; union. Ahead of their meeting, Fridman took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to publicly urge Zelensky to conduct the conversation in Russian, citing it as the only language in which both men were fluent. &#x201C;Speaking in a language we&apos;re both fluent in will result in the most deep, dynamic, and powerful conversation,&#x201D; Fridman wrote. Moscow-born U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman during his interview with President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Jan.5, 2024. (Lex Fridman / YouTube)During the interview, Fridman was met with a lighthearted jab from Zelensky, who, with a smile, remarked that Fridman&#x2019;s Russian was &#x201C;not that great.&#x201D; Throughout his career as an actor and comedian, Zelensky was a fixture of Ukraine&#x2019;s Russian-speaking cultural sphere, enjoying widespread popularity in both Ukraine and Russia. But as Zelensky explained to Fridman, the past decade of war with Russia &#x2014; and particularly the nearly three years since the full-scale invasion &#x2014; had dramatically shifted many Ukrainians&#x2019; perspectives on the use of the Russian language in society. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t respond in Russian the entire interview, because this is how it is today. I am not making anything up, you can see it all for yourself, you can feel and hear it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, while mentioning the number of Russian missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a recent attack. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think you can just pretend that nothing is happening and give Putin a pass once again for saying that we are one people, that we speak one language. (Russians) speak the language of weapons. That is a fact. And we are peaceful people.&#x201D; Undeterred, Fridman countered with a note of optimism, expressing his &quot;hope&quot; on the first of several occasions that the Russian people &#x2014; and perhaps even Putin himself &#x2014; might see the interview. Zelensky reminded Fridman that he had made a direct appeal to the Russian people in their own language at the outset of the full-scale war, only to be met with silence. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re mute,&#x201D; Zelensky said, adding: &#x201C;They did not listen.&#x201D; A billboard promoting contract army service and reading &quot;5 200 000 rubles for the first year of the contract&quot; (about $57,000) is seen in western Moscow, Russia on Sept. 11, 2024. (Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Zelensky also pushed back against Fridman&#x2019;s concern that translation might dull the impact of their conversation &#x2014; a puzzling point given the interview was ultimately made available entirely in Ukrainian, English, and Russian using awkward, AI-generated voiceovers. &#x201C;I think what is most important is what we&#x2019;re talking about, not how,&#x201D; Zelensky said. The question of language set the tone for the interview before it even began, with Fridman&#x2019;s talking points suggesting he appeared to want to not only reinforce his own narrative about Ukraine, but also to subtly encourage Zelensky to align with his perspective. &#x201C;Do you think there will ever be a day when the Ukrainian people will ever forgive the Russian people? And both peoples will travel back and forth again and marry each other, rekindle and form friendships?&#x201D; Fridman asked. Although visibly taken aback by the question, Zelensky said that history has demonstrated the possibility of such an outcome. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how it will be for us,&#x201D; he said before emphasizing a crucial condition: any path forward would require Russians to first acknowledge their culpability as the aggressor in the war. Perhaps the key topic Fridman raised during the interview was the issue of U.S. aid, and concerns about its potential misuse. Fridman said that how Ukraine addresses these corruption allegations will be a crucial factor in shaping the country&apos;s future trajectory. While clarifying that much of U.S. aid to Ukraine consists of military support rather than direct financial assistance, Zelensky highlighted the development of a sophisticated anti-corruption system under his leadership, calling it &#x201C;the most advanced in all of Europe,&#x201D; and a vital element of Ukraine&#x2019;s journey towards EU membership. Zelensky was referring to institutions such as the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting high-level corruption among officials. Though these institutions have not been without their own controversies regarding the impartiality of some of its officials, Zelensky expressed confidence in their ability to uncover and address any institutional corruption within Ukraine. Ukraine has grappled with multiple corruption scandals tied to wartime procurement. Some Defense Ministry officials under the tenure of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov were accused of embezzling money through the purchase of low-quality equipment for soldiers, as well as purchasing food for the military at inflated prices. Ukrainian authorities have also detained a number of military enlistment officers on charges of accepting bribes from men attempting to evade deployment to the front lines. &#x201C;We talk about (corruption) openly,&#x201D; Zelensky said, adding: &#x201C;We are genuinely fighting against it.&#x201D; &#x201C;I am sure Ukraine will overcome all this. (But) this takes a little time.&#x201D; Zelensky also spoke of his administration&#x2019;s successes in curbing oligarch influence, citing the incarceration of Ihor Kolomoisky &#x2014; one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most powerful oligarchs &#x2014; as a major achievement. Zelensky also suggested that corruption was an issue in Western countries. Ukraine has received less than half of the $177 billion in U.S. aid allocated to support Kyiv throughout the full-scale war, according to Zelensky. He suggested that this shortfall could be tied to issues of corruption or lobbying by U.S. companies. &quot;If we had $177 billion and if we get the half, where is the second half? If you find the second half, you will find corruption,&quot; he said. Fridman shared his &#x201C;dream&#x201D; of a scenario in which Trump could facilitate a meeting between Zelensky and Putin to bring the war to an end. Zelensky argued that it was &#x201C;naive&#x201D; to believe Putin genuinely sought an end to the war, emphasizing the need to approach negotiations from a position of strength &#x2014; an outcome he hoped Trump could help facilitate. &#x201C;President Trump will be in the same situation as I was in 2019 &#x2014; precisely the same situation. I want to end the war, and we want lasting peace for Ukraine. We must do this. The ceasefire, exchange people, and then diplomatically return all territories, and we will do this through diplomacy,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;What will happen next with President Trump? If the ceasefire happens without security guarantees, at least for the territory we control, what does he get? If he manages to make a ceasefire deal and three months later Putin launches a new wave of attacks, what will Trump look like? What will Ukraine look like?&#x201D; (L-R) President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend their summit on Ukraine at Elysee Palace in Paris, France on Dec. 9, 2019. (Christophe Petit Tesson - Pool/Getty Images)To explain why he didn&#x2019;t believe Putin was interested in a peace deal, Zelensky recalled the 2019 Normandy Format meeting, a high-stakes summit in which he joined French President Emmanuel Macron, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Putin to negotiate a ceasefire in the ongoing war. According to Zelensky, Putin appeared strikingly uninformed about key details, such as the length of the front line or the timeline required to disengage troops &#x2014; an omission Zelensky attributed to Putin&#x2019;s lack of intention to follow through on any ceasefire deal. The Russian leader, however, displayed marked preparation on one topic: maintaining gas transit agreements, underscoring the economic stakes that loomed over the discussions. The ceasefire lasted less than a month, and Putin stopped taking Zelensky&#x2019;s calls. Russia sent snipers to Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern regions, where they honed their skills by &#x201C;hunting&#x201D; the very Ukrainian civilians that Putin claimed the war was intended to protect, Zelensky said. These snipers were then deployed to other conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East, according to Zelensky. Proof of this sent to international organizations like the U.N. went unheeded, Zelensky said. &#x201C;(Putin) is darkness personified. And you offer him, as it were, to be subjectivized. There&#x2019;s only one reason: fear,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;And you say we need to talk. Listen. We need to be in a strong position and not talk but end the war.&#x201D; Zelensky went on to warn that without security guarantees, such as NATO membership, Putin would inevitably launch another invasion of Ukraine in the future. Calls for compromise as a means to reach an agreement with Russia drew a swift and pointed rebuke from Zelensky, who argued that Ukraine asking for NATO membership was in itself a compromise. Zelensky went on to tell Fridman that Putin&apos;s continued freedom &#x2014; and the improbability of him ever facing imprisonment &#x2014; was itself a compromise, and that it was impossible to forgive Putin for the war. &#x201C;To forgive? No one will forgive. It is absolutely impossible to forgive him,&#x201D; Zelensky said, his tone resolute as he sought to drive home the gravity of the losses Ukraine has endured. &#x201C;We cannot comprehend the mind or soul of someone who has lost their family,&#x201D; he added, invoking the countless Ukrainian families who have suffered the loss of children, in particular, what he called the loss of &#x201C;the most precious thing in this world.&#x201D; While U.S. Democrats promoted the idea that Trump is &#x201C;pro-Putin,&#x201D; Zelensky notably took the opportunity during the interview to contrast the leadership skills of Trump and Putin. Zelensky implied that Trump as U.S. president cared more about his people, given the number of places he visited across the country during the presidential campaign.

(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I pray to God that (war) will never be on your land,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;But I&#x2019;m sure if you had some (natural disaster) on your land that President Trump would be there (in a matter of days). Otherwise, how will people look at him?&#x201D; Zelensky went on to note that Putin had yet to visit Kursk Oblast, part of which is now under Ukrainian military control, since Kyiv launched an incursion in August. This failure to visit Kursk Oblast and be with the people there, Zelensky argued, highlighted the disconnect between Putin&#x2019;s propaganda-fueled image as a leader devoted to protecting his people and the reality of his actions. Amid the gravity of the topics addressed during the far-reaching interview, one moment captured Zelensky&#x2019;s perspective with a touch of dark humor &#x2014; a nod to his past as a comedian. When Fridman jokingly floated the idea of a hypothetical meeting between Zelensky and Putin by the sea, Zelensky quipped: &#x201C;One of us may drown. And I am a good swimmer.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-takes-on-putin-apologists-us-skeptics-on-3-hour-lex-fridman-podcast/	2025-01-06T11:38:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190032907.jpg
As Russians inch closer to Pokrovsk, civilians in the area are left with a choice — stay under fire or leave life behind	BILOZERSKE, Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; Less than 30 kilometers north of embattled Pokrovsk, a market was in full swing in the town of Bilozerske. Meters away, however, a crowd has gathered in front of a building, nervously awaiting the doors to open. Tensions were visibly mounting as the doors remained closed and impatience settled. An umpteenth air raid siren reminded everyone about the never-ending threat from Russian drones and glide bombs in the area. Nobody seemed to care about a potential attack. People were waiting for hours at the distribution point, seeking their turn to receive hygiene kits and water supplies. No one seemed to want to lose their place in the queue. Anastasia Olekh, from the Caritas Mariupol non-government humanitarian organization, said that Bilozerske remains full of people in need, becoming a safe haven for those fleeting towns and villages closer to the front line. &#x201C;Prior to the full-scale invasion, there were around 15,000 people here. Since 2022, many have left, but we also saw an additional 5,000 displaced people coming from settlements of the Pokrovsk district directly under fire,&#x201D; Olekh said. The city of Pokrovsk, which once counted some 60,000 residents, now counts a mere 11,000 thousand, with Russian troops aiming to surround and occupy it while gradually turning the city into rubble. &#x201C;So far, Bilozerske has not been too affected by war, and its coal mine is still open, which means there is still work for civilians, but the living conditions are dire,&#x201D; Olekh added. Valentyna, a 65-year-old resident of Bilozerske, has chosen to stay in the town with her husband and their dog. Valentyna says she is aware of the danger, yet chooses, for now, to not leave because of the lack of funds and opportunities elsewhere. &#x201C;Compared to Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, or Pokrovsk, it is safer here as long as we are not being shelled,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We know that when they (the Russians) will reach Pokrovsk, they will try to finish us off here as well. But we simply don&#x2019;t have anywhere else to go,&#x201D; she added. Valentyna&#x2019;s biggest fear is glide bombs, which Russia has been increasingly using in 2024. &#x201C;Since they have started to launch them, we no longer feel safe. Our air defense can shoot down missiles, but not glide bombs; those are just terrible; that&#x2019;s why we are hoping for some kind of truce, through diplomatic channels, so that those bombs no longer fly,&#x201D; she said.

(Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Not far from Valentyna, Olena, 42, was also standing in the queue. Olena used to work on a farm near Bilozerske, where she lives with her family. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here with my 15-year-old daughter and my five-year-old son,&#x201D; she said, adding that she also takes care of her mother with cancer, thus unable to leave the town. &#x201C;My main worry is my children, right now, they are cut out from the world,&#x201D; she added. Not far from the queue, local residents Svitlana and her husband were loading a month&#x2019;s worth of water supplies in their car. The retired couple from Bilozerske had no intention of leaving. Over the deafening sound of sirens, Svitlana seemed annoyed even at the thought of evacuation, although theoretically, it is mandatory in the area. &#x201C;Look, my husband and I are both 72. We have lived in Bilozerske for the last 50 years. We got married here, our children grew up and were baptized here, what is the point of leaving? Obviously it is scary, but no, we will not be leaving,&#x201D; she said. Olena, 42, in Bilozerske, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec.9, 2024. (Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Whether bound by financial constraints or memories of peaceful times at home, most civilians feel they have nowhere else to go, and while Bilozerske doesn&#x2019;t &#x2013; yet &#x2013; lie directly in the combat zone, some, who have already relocated once, simply feel trapped here for lack of better options. Anastasia came from Toretsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting since 2022. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s military, the fighting is currently ongoing in the town&#x2019;s streets. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already moved once, a year ago, as the situation has become unbearable in Toretsk. Our flat has since been looted and then destroyed. I was already used to living in combat zone, so in comparison, things have been quiet here,&#x201D; Anastasia said. &#x201C;Anyway, I can&#x2019;t afford to move further away from the front line, you just have to look at the steep price rise for flats in Dnipro, in Poltava, for example, to understand why we stay here,&#x201D; she added. Those who have relatives elsewhere or take safety over the potential hardship far from home make their way to Pavlohrad, in nearby Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Following the Russian offensive targeting Pokrovsk, the city of Pavlohrad became the new evacuation hub for those fleeing the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Once home to 100,000 people and located 100 kilometers west from Pokrovsk, Pavlohrad is now overcrowded with people desperate to flee and officials and volunteers helping them get by. Around the clock, cars, buses, and vans are bringing those evacuated from Donetsk Oblast. What had been a theater hall is now a dormitory for those awaiting their train or bus further west. Residents are brought to a theater-turned-dormitory in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 9, 2024.

(Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Seats have been piled at the back of the hall to make way for folding beds. Blue care packages from the United Nations lie around. The theater hall is silent, but each of its residents bears the traces of war: in semi-darkness, a handful of elderly wait to be brought to a more permanent accommodation, surrounded by a few plastic bags containing all of the belongings they were able to take with them. Near the stage, a woman was sitting in a state of shock, surrounded by her two dogs. She came from Kurakhove, and counts among the last people evacuated from the city. On Jan. 6, Russia declared it had captured Kurakhove, a bombed-out town, the population of which decreased from 18,000 to a mere 2,000 people since the start of the all-out war. Exhausted, the woman can barely speak, and is in need of medical treatment. Near her, an elderly man with crutches was sitting on his bed, where he was taking notes in a small notebook, using his mobile phone as a torchlight. Another woman muttered unintelligible words to herself, folding and unfolding a few clothes on her bed. In the corridor, Viktor, 66, a former miner, has just arrived from Myhrnohrad. His eyes were hollow, he was still shaking. Sitting on a bench, he was waiting for registration and would go whenever he was sent as long as it was safe. Viktor, 66, a former miner, in Myrnohrad, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec.9, 2024. (Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;There were soldiers in the streets, my city is no longer accessible and constantly under shelling. I don&#x2019;t have anywhere to go, nor do I want to get in touch with relatives in safer places. I heard I would go to a shelter in Kyiv Oblast,&#x201D; Viktor said. Disoriented and weak after having spent months with no water, no electricity, and no heating, Viktor followed humanitarian workers in the hall, where he would await a commute to his Kyiv Oblast accommodation. He said he knew he might never come back home. An evacuation was called by authorities of Donetsk Oblast during the summer and autumn, with police, the military and local and international NGOs helping with the evacuation effort. The work is carried out at great risk, as the Russian troops routinely use drones to target civilians and humanitarian workers all over the region. Despite the calls from officials, as of mid-December, around 300,000 civilians remained in Donetsk Oblast, out of which 54,000 lived directly in an active warzone, according to the Donetsk Military Administration. When asked why they would not leave the danger zone, those who spoke with the Kyiv Independent named two reasons &#x2014; tough decision to leave home and lack of opportunities elsewhere.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russians-inch-closer-to-pokrovsk-civilians-in-the-area-are-left-with-a-choice-stay-under-fire-or-leave-life-behind/	2025-01-06T10:54:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191061556.jpg
Russian drone attack against bus in Kherson, kills 1, injures 6	A Russian drone strike targeted a bus in a Kherson neighborhood on Jan. 6, killing one person and injuring six others, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The man killed, Volodymyr Shum, 50, was a specialist in the municipal services and landscaping division of the Kherson City Council&apos;s municipal economy department. Among the injured were five women, aged between 29 and 57, and the 66-year-old driver, all of whom were hospitalized with blast injuries and are undergoing medical evaluation. Kherson and settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River endure daily Russian attacks as Moscow&apos;s forces maintain control of the river&#x2019;s east bank. Prokudin reported an increase in assaults as Russian troops attempt to solidify their positions in the region. Kherson and its surrounding areas were liberated during Ukraine&#x2019;s fall 2022 counteroffensive but remain under frequent bombardment. A Dec. 1 attack on a shuttle bus in Kherson killed three and injured eight, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-against-bus-in-kherson-kills-3-injures-at-least-6/	2025-01-06T10:01:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-06_16-32-04.jpg
Europe cannot fill void left by US in Ukraine’s defense	Since the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, the question on everyone&apos;s mind is whether Europe, including the U.K., can replace the military assistance the U.S. is giving Ukraine. The short answer is no. The reasons for this are a mix of politics and capabilities. The U.S. and the European Union currently provide similar amounts of military aid to Ukraine &#x2014; 43% each, according to the latest figures. In the EU, Germany is the largest donor (12%), and the United Kingdom provides the second-most generous assistance from outside the EU (9%). These figures speak for themselves: For the EU to replace the U.S., it would need to double its military aid to Ukraine. The current political situation in Europe, along with the real military capabilities of individual European countries, means Europe will not be able to step up in the short term. This is bad for Ukraine and bad news for Europe, which is slowly waking up to the reality that without the U.S., it would struggle to mount any meaningful defense against an outside aggressor. How did we get here? After the end of the Cold War, most European countries reduced their military production and/or shifted their military industrial models, focusing on export markets and just-in-time production. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center, provides the example of Germany, which has recently increased military spending. But at current rates, it would take decades for the country to replenish its weapons stockpiles to the level they were 20 years ago. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, &#x201C;Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, Europe&#x2019;s defense industry has increased its ammunition production capacity by 50% and aims to produce more than 2 million shells per year by the end of 2025 &#x2014; double its capacity in February 2022,&#x201D; which is a positive development. The European Commission has proposed shifting the EU to a war economy, but this is still in the discussion phase. Ukraine will need more than proposals debated in Brussels to meet the shortfall left by a potential American withdrawal. To complicate matters, defense is one of the least integrated industrial sectors in the EU, meaning it cannot benefit from the economies of scale of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Since Brexit, the U.K. will no longer be able to participate in EU-wide defense industry projects, adding to the challenges. Bilateral agreements between the U.K. and France and between the U.K. and Germany, however, will attempt to facilitate military procurement and development between the U.K. and two major European defense heavyweights.

(Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images)French President Emmanuel Macron has been one of the most vocal Western European leaders calling for an independent European defense and for wholehearted support for Ukraine. But actual progress in ramping up industrial production in France has been slow. France remains one of the smallest contributors of military aid to Ukraine relative to its GDP, although the French have delivered most of what they have promised. The lack of capacity is not just a European problem but a NATO-wide issue. In February 2023, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Ukraine&#x2019;s rate of ammunition expenditure was many times higher than the allies&#x2019; current production rate, putting NATO defense industries under strain. Even before Trump&#x2019;s victory, a U.S. disengagement from Europe seemed likely due to strains on its own defense sector and the defense establishment&#x2019;s strategic pivot toward Asia and the Middle East. Keir Giles of Chatham House, whose book &#x201C;Who Will Defend Europe&#x201D; was launched earlier this month, argues that Europe always knew what Trump&#x2019;s arrival would mean for Ukraine. A precursor was seen earlier this year when Congress blocked the new military aid package to Ukraine. The result on the battlefield was clear in terms of loss of men and territory. Giles&#x2019; warning is dire: &#x201C;If Washington resigns, there is nothing to stand in the way of Russia,&#x201D; be it for Ukraine or for Europe as a whole. As Ukraine approaches the third anniversary of all-out war with Russia, pressure is mounting on its leaders to negotiate. Because of years of &#x201C;criminal dereliction of duty&#x201D; by European governments, as Giles calls it, Europe now finds itself in a position where it cannot defend a country that has sacrificed tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of lives to defend not only its own territory but Europe as a whole. At the time of writing, Germany, Europe&#x2019;s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Olaf Scholz-led coalition. France&#x2019;s Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine despite his initial impulses to seek dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has lost much of his freedom of action since the June parliamentary elections, where he lost his majority. Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right and far left, with pro-Russian sympathies, are rising. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a friend of Putin and Trump, is a major obstacle to EU-wide military assistance to Ukraine. The countries on Europe&#x2019;s new frontline &#x2014; the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as Poland &#x2014; understand the Russian threat. They have been generous toward Ukraine in absolute terms while ramping up their own defense spending. While the EU and its member states have made strides in increasing military aid and production, the stark reality remains that Europe cannot yet fill the void left by the U.S., either in terms of its own defense or that of Ukraine. As long as perceived national interests continue to diverge and political stability wavers, particularly in key countries like Germany and France, Europe will struggle to forge a unified and effective response to the war raging on its continent. But the time for Europe to confront its obligations is now, as the stakes have never been higher. This should start by emulating Poland and the Nordic countries, understanding that defending Ukraine is not an act of charity, but the number one priority for self-defense.

Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister, party leader, to stay in office until replacement selected	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Jan. 1 that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberal Party but remain in office until the party selects a new leader. Under Trudeau&#x2019;s leadership, Canada has been a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. &quot;This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I&#x2019;m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,&quot; he said. Trudeau has faced mounting pressure from his party, particularly after the abrupt resignation of Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Public support for the prime minister has waned over the past year, and the opposition Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, has consistently outperformed him in polls. The next federal election is scheduled for October 2025, but a snap election may occur as opposition parties have pledged to bring a no-confidence vote when parliament reconvenes on Jan. 27. Trudeau made history as Canada&apos;s youngest Prime Minister when he was elected in 2015. As a hereditary politician, he is the son of Pierre Trudeau, who held the office from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadian-pm-trudeau-to-resign-as-liberal-leader-stay-in-office-until-replacement-selected/	2025-01-06T09:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157822397.jpg
Russia fueling Transnistria energy crisis for propaganda, destabilization, Moldova says	The energy crisis in Transnistria, triggered by Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 cutoff of gas supplies, is part of a broader Russian plan to manipulate and spread propaganda, Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Voda said on Jan. 6. &quot;Russian propaganda tries to create a story in which Moldova becomes a &#x2018;problematic actor,&#x2019; although the government has proposed clear solutions to avoid the crisis,&quot; he said. Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant, halted gas deliveries to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials disputed these claims, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the early 1990s, relies heavily on Russian gas and has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. Voda said the crisis reflects Russia&apos;s deliberate effort to create fear and unrest. &quot;This energy crisis is more than an economic problem &#x2014; it is part of a larger Russian plan of manipulation and propaganda designed to create fear and discontent on both banks of the Dnister.&quot; Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot; The spokesperson criticized the refusal, calling it a failure to &quot;cooperate for the benefit of the people.&quot; Russian propaganda has sought to blame Chisinau for the crisis, alleging that Moldovan authorities intentionally caused power outages to punish the region, Voda said. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies through Romania, Transnistria remains heavily dependent on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-is-fueling-transnistria-energy-crisis-for-propaganda-destabilization-moldova-says/	2025-01-06T08:38:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-84152606.jpg
Economy Minister: They said no one would invest in country at war. They were wrong	In early 2022, the Ukrainian team of an Austrian wood processing company held a meeting in a bomb shelter during an air raid alert. Despite a Russian strike nearby, their focus wasn&apos;t on relocation but on building a new logistics center in the country. A year later, their determination paid off &#x2014; built from scratch, a new 22-million-euro facility was a symbol of resilience and trust. At the onset of the invasion, some claimed no one would invest in a country at war. They were wrong. Most regions are now relatively safe for business, with robust investor support programs driving steady Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) growth ($4.2 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in the first 10 months of 2024). Despite a significant portion coming from reinvestments, new investments are also on the rise. Today, Ukraine&apos;s primary investors are domestic companies and investors committed to the country&apos;s future. Despite the war, they continue launching new products and expanding their reach to new markets in sectors such as agriculture, construction, logistics, energy, machine industry, and pharmaceuticals. Lifecell signboard is visible on the facade of the building in Lviv, Ukraine on Dec. 15, 2023. (Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Foreign companies are cautiously following suit. Unilever is building new production facilities, Azerbaijan&apos;s NEQSOL Holding acquired Ukraine&apos;s largest titanium production company through major privatization efforts, and Austrian Kronospan has built a new production line in Rivne. A standout business case is French investor Xavier Niel&apos;s $600-million acquisition of a Ukrainian telecom provider &#x2014; the largest deal since the start of the full-scale invasion. Even before 2022, such deals were rare. Those who recognize the opportunities today can already reap the benefits. So, what does Ukraine offer? Several tools are in place for those looking to establish production in Ukraine. Among the most effective ones are industrial parks. Currently, 25 industrial enterprises are operating or being built in these parks, including branches of foreign companies, spanning sectors like agro-processing, woodworking, and machinery. In 2024, Ukraine allocated around 1 billion hryvnias ($25 million) in state support to develop industrial infrastructure in 15 industrial parks. Manufacturers operating in these zones benefit from tax and customs incentives. Access to finance is facilitated through the 5-7-9% Affordable Loans Program, which has been refocused on investment goals. The program now includes financing energy equipment as well. Additionally, the Significant Investments Program is now operational. Businesses investing at least 12 million euros can qualify for up to 30% compensation through tax and customs benefits and other forms of state support. The first agreements under this program have already been signed. Ukraine is also attracting investments with our partners&apos; support. The 50-billion-euro Ukraine Facility program by the European Commission includes an investment component, the Ukraine Investment Framework (UIF), worth 9.3 billion euros. This mechanism combines European Commission guarantees, grants, and technical assistance combined with other financial tools available in Ukraine. We anticipate this initiative will draw up to 40 billion euros over the next few years, with each euro of guarantees potentially attracting an additional 2&#x2013;4 euros in investments.

(Diego Fedele/Getty Images)The first 1.4 billion euros under the UIF is already accessible in the form of guarantees, financing, grants, and technical assistance. These funds are channeled through programs of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), International Finance Corporation (IFC), German Development Bank (KfW), European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE), and Polish National Development Bank (BGK). Both Ukrainian and foreign businesses can submit their projects to these institutions or partner banks in Ukraine to apply for financing. Next year, the European Commission is expected to announce additional programs totaling approximately 3 billion euros for public sector projects. It plans to introduce direct financing for the corporate sector and investments in private equity through private equity funds. Currently, international financial institutions and the European Commission are in the process of selecting projects eligible for funding. A detailed handbook provides step-by-step guidance for businesses on how to submit applications. We aim to make investing as transparent as possible, so the government has developed digital databases of public and private projects. For the first time in history, the government has created a Single Project Pipeline comprising 787 public investment projects. Some of them are already funded by the state budget, some by international financial institutions. For projects that require further refinement, we will establish a Project Preparation Facility in 2025. For example, if a community requires investment for reconstruction but cannot prepare a bankable project, this facility will provide support. Requests for assistance will need to be submitted through the DREAM system. Moving from public to private sector projects, proposals from businesses are consolidated on the Investment Portal. Its 126 projects worth $28.9 billion in key sectors such as agricultural processing, transportation and logistics, energy, green transition, critical materials, manufacturing, IT, and digitalization. We&apos;re also exploring the launch of a similar Project Preparation Facility to help the private sector develop business projects in strategic sectors. Pending legislative changes aim to improve public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Ukraine. A draft law currently awaiting a vote would simplify the process of attracting private capital, enable the combination of private and donor grant financing, and offer stronger guarantees for investors, aligning PPP procedures with EU standards. Preparations are underway for concession projects at the Chornomorsk port and pilot healthcare PPPs. If the law is approved in 2025, the first tenders for private partners could be announced immediately. The year 2024 marked a milestone for Ukraine&apos;s privatization efforts. Iconic assets like the Hotel Ukraine, the titanium producer United Mining and Chemical Company, and the first sanctioned asset, the Aeroc Plant, found new owners. Loss-making state enterprises now have an opportunity to revive, while sanctioned assets, once security threats, will become engines of national recovery. As a result, privatization revenues reached nearly 12 billion hryvnias (nearly $300 million) &#x2014; triple the original target for 2024.

This is why developing a robust insurance infrastructure is a priority. This year, Ukraine&apos;s Export Credit Agency began offering war insurance for export-oriented manufacturers, and the first contracts have been signed. We&apos;ve also launched the Unity mechanism to insure vessels traveling to and from Ukraine through the Black Sea corridor, while the EBRD introduced long-awaited cargo insurance. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation expanded its tools, enabling small and medium businesses to secure insurance through Ukrainian reinsurers. Additionally, successful projects have been implemented with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Looking ahead, we&apos;re working with the National Bank on legislation to establish a comprehensive state-backed war risk insurance system for both individuals and businesses. War doesn&apos;t put a cap on investment. Nearly three years of the full-scale war have proven that despite all, investors are willing to see Ukraine as a destination for their capital. Following the construction of a new logistics center, the Austrian investor launched a new 200 million euro chipboard production line in Rivne.	https://kyivindependent.com/they-said-no-one-would-invest-in-a-country-at-war-they-were-wrong/	2025-01-06T08:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2182512939.jpg
‘We are in a year like 1938’ – Estonian foreign minister on a crucial time for Ukraine and Europe	As Ukraine and Europe enter 2025 with a worsening situation on the battlefield and the incoming Trump administration hoping to quickly reach some kind of peace in Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, the first months of the year look to be fundamental in deciding the outcome of the war. While much will be decided on the battlefield, the race is on for Western countries to come together and find the strongest and most united position in Ukraine, but many of the biggest players continue to hold back. &#xA0; Since Trump&#x2019;s re-election, discussions have been reported between several countries on the topic of braver support for Ukraine, including placing foreign troops inside Ukrainian territory; though no public decisions have been made. Not long after Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called for the West to look into &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; options of securing Ukrainian-controlled territory from a repeat Russian invasion after a peace deal, the Kyiv Independent spoke to the minister in Tallinn. This conversation is part of a series of interviews with decision-makers in the Nordic and Baltic countries conducted during the European screening tour of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s documentary film &#x201C;Can You Hear Me? The invisible battles of Ukrainian military medics.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: From the Estonian perspective, how decisive is this moment in time for Ukraine and the next few months for Ukraine and for the security of Europe as a whole? Margus Tsahkna: On Feb. 24 (2022), (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s plan was to take over (Kyiv) within a couple of days, and he did not succeed. We have to remember that Ukraine has been very successful. We always talk about how now peace must be done and wrap it up, and also that Ukraine is in a bad position. But, actually, Ukraine has been able to fight back. Europe has been waking up. I was the defense minister in 2016-17, and I see the total difference in Europe (compared to then). We have realized two things. One is that Russia is an aggressive country and it will remain a threat for Europe, not only for Ukraine. Secondly, that we can fight back. It is very important that this change of mentality is there. And now, of course, the situation is very complicated, there are more and more talks about peace. But what is the meaning of peace? Who is winning? Who is losing? Of course, Putin is putting the narrative very actively on the table that he&apos;s winning, he&apos;s gaining more territories. For Ukraine, it&apos;s really, really complicated to fight back, we understand this. From an Estonian perspective, we advocate and we ask everybody to give more, especially in defense and military support. Honestly, we all want peace, most Ukrainians want peace. But the peace must be just and long-lasting. One thing we don&apos;t see is actually Putin wanting peace. You cannot weaken your positions by talking about peace when the other side is actually committing this aggression, and not showing any willingness to change the goal. The goal for Putin was not to gain more territories. The goal was actually to take down the Ukrainian democratic government &#x2013; he has said publicly that such a nation as Ukraine does not exist. This is the goal, and I don&apos;t see that it has changed at all. So I&apos;m advocating to our allies publicly that we need to understand that any kind of ceasefire is not peace. Any kind of peace without security guarantees is not actually peace. And there cannot be a peace process without Ukraine, it&apos;s impossible. We need to make Ukraine&apos;s position stronger. Of course, there is a player entering now in the middle of January to the White House, (U.S. President-elect) Donald Trump. He is listening pretty carefully to what we have said and what we are saying, meeting different leaders of European countries. We just need to put the arguments on the table because I don&#x2019;t think that President Trump is interested in a weak ceasefire because then Russia will remain a threat.

Fallon /AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: In your discussions with partners, how close are we, do you think, to a real unified understanding that peace must come with hard deterrence against a repeat invasion? Margus Tsahkna: I see the change that countries understand that Russia will remain a threat to Europe, it&apos;s there. More and more, different nations and governments are talking about what more we can do. We have increased our defense investments. Not all of us, mainly the bordering (with Russia) countries and the Nordic countries. But still, too many countries are thinking that maybe business as usual can come back, that let&apos;s have peace and maybe normal life will return. It will not. We have also seen that for countries neighboring Russia, a &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; position is just a green light for Putin. And we need to understand as well that Putin is not a leader of the country who is taking care of his nation. He has built up a regime of terror, of fear, around the idea of restoring the empire. He is an old man, and he knows that he is fighting for his life. So it is not so easy for him to stop this war machine he has built up. It is based on fear in their own society. It is based on a war economy. The war is the basic core his power is relying on. It is not easy anymore to stop it without using force or without fighting against this aggression. And Ukrainians, you are doing that. Not us. The Kyiv Independent: Just recently, we&#x2019;ve seen top Russian representatives say that there will be no freezing of the conflict. Do you think that we should take what they&apos;re saying at face value, that they simply do not plan to stop? Or are they positioning themselves for negotiations with the highest possible demands? Margus Tsahkna: Of course, Russia is positioning. Putin is afraid of President Trump&apos;s incoming administration, and Russia is not so secure on the resources front. North Korean troops are there, of course, but Russia also is relying on North Korean ammunition, Iranian drones, and economic support from China. With this talk, they are trying to strengthen their position. But we don&apos;t have to believe that. This peace and just peace will be made on the battlefield, so we need to focus on how we can make Ukraine&#x2019;s position stronger. If President (Volodymyr) Zelensky feels that all the Western partners are just pushing him to a peace deal, it&apos;s not a very strong position. I totally agree with the European Union&#x2019;s high representative of foreign policy (former Estonian Prime Minister) Kaja Kallas, who said we shouldn&#x2019;t push Ukraine to peace talks if we see that Putin has not changed his goal. The Kyiv Independent: Zelensky has said in several interviews that Ukraine would be ready to stop the war on their side if it was in exchange for NATO membership, but this is firmly opposed by some of the biggest players in NATO. Does Estonia agree that NATO membership is the only option, and if there are other options, what could they be? Margus Tsahkna: The main question is that if there is a post-war situation, how can we give Ukraine solid security guarantees? With Putin, we know that these must be military security guarantees. We had the Minsk agreements, and Ukraine signed &#x201C;security guarantees&#x201D; in 1994 (Budapest Memorandum), and they were not security guarantees. From an Estonian perspective, we are not only talking about Ukraine: We are talking about the European, regional security guarantees, and Ukraine is part of that. What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated. We have examples from the past as West Germany was taken into NATO when the East part was actually occupied. It&apos;s a matter of political will. But the honest thing is as well, we don&apos;t exactly know President Trump&#x2019;s position, and what the official plan will be. So we need to use this time first to support Ukraine because we are not only securing the situation in Ukraine, we are securing Europe. We are in a year like 1938 in Europe, just before the Munich meeting when Prime Minister (Neville) Chamberlain went back to Great Britain and showed the white paper and said now the peace is here. We can go back home and say that we brought peace, but if it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression. Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order. The UN Charter is meant to uphold this order, and if it doesn&apos;t work, if it&apos;s not able now to support Ukraine and forge the kind of peace that is just and long-lasting, then this system may collapse, and it affects everybody.

(Alexander Welscher / Picture alliance via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: You have made headlines a few times by being the first major high-level state representative to openly call for the boots-on-the-ground idea to be looked at seriously. Could you share something about how you imagine that working, especially if Russia is interested in invading again? Margus Tsahkna: Of course, it is unclear, because what we are witnessing right now is full aggression. Russia is more aggressive than at any time during the last two and a half years, especially now with the North Korean troops there. This makes this conflict or this aggression totally different already on the political and global level. The other thing is that there are no peace talks right now, we don&apos;t see that Putin would like to have any kind of peace. It&apos;s very hard to imagine what kind of security guarantees without NATO membership can be there, but there must be a real backup system for the deal, whatever it ends up being. This is the right time to discuss readiness, what one country or another is ready to do. Of course, this cannot be done without the U.S., without the big countries, but it&apos;s too early to share because it&apos;s just in the beginning and we have many preconditions that are not there yet. The Kyiv Independent: Is there a scenario where European countries, those who have the same clarity as Estonia, Poland, and others, are compelled to take maybe braver steps even without the US? Margus Tsahkna: I understand your concern. I was defense minister when Trump first entered the White House, and there was a lot of speculation about what would happen. In the end, we gained more troops on the ground, more military and financial support because of the regional security situation. The honest answer is, we don&apos;t know yet what will be Trump&apos;s plan or proposition. We&apos;re using this time to explain, to put arguments on the table. This is not an isolated problem. It is all connected. It&apos;s all connected with Iran, with China. China will probably be at the center of President Trump&apos;s foreign policy. So this is all connected. Many people have said many things during their political campaigns, but what counts is what will really happen. I&apos;m not going to speculate about what could be with or without the U.S. Our security in Europe is connected to the U.S. and the other way around, our economies are very much connected. This is a global square, and Ukraine is playing a very crucial role, so let&apos;s do things in the right order. Our duty, as well as that of Ukraine&#x2019;s leaders, is to explain. The Kyiv Independent: You mention that the most important thing is improving Ukraine&apos;s position on the battlefield. But from the Ukrainian perspective, the feeling is that the status quo is not working, especially because Ukraine&apos;s ability to stay in the war is also limited by manpower. Are there other asymmetrical political measures that braver European countries could take to show Putin that the West does not plan in any way to abandon Ukraine? Margus Tsahkna: We have had (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron&#x2019;s initiatives (floating the idea of French troops in Ukraine). These opportunities are all there: for example, training missions and many other things. But I believe the most sustainable for the long run idea is to invest heavily in Ukraine, in its defense industry, technological capabilities, and so on. We need to give what Ukrainians are asking for, and Ukraine is not asking for boots on the ground to go to the battlefield, because maybe it&apos;s not even a smart idea. These are complicated times. We have elections in Germany, we have President Trump entering the White House with all the rhetoric that we have heard. Of course, Putin is using this opportunity, because he has only one voice, but we have many different voices. I cannot even personally imagine the situation that you as a nation and those people on the front are going through. It&apos;s hard for us Estonians to come back so often from different meetings with no decisions, then meeting our Ukrainian friends and explaining that, yes, we want to do more, but somehow we are not able to. If we had given everything that we have within the last two and a half years straight away, Russia would already have been pushed back to Russia. There is fear in the Western part of the world about what happens if Putin loses. I remember once the same fear, of what if the Soviet Union collapses. This fear of Putin&apos;s collapse is actually stopping many, many decisions. We need to keep pushing. The Kyiv Independent: If they are afraid of Russia losing, do you think something needs to get much worse before the West sees the threat of Ukraine losing, to finally make that final step to wake up? Margus Tsahkna: We have witnessed from the past what happens if Putin has an opportunity to continue, and he will continue anyway. I really hope that we don&apos;t need the years 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 to finally understand that we could have a different situation. That&apos;s why I&apos;m bringing this parallel with the Munich meeting in 1938. But I&apos;m actually more positive that we can support Ukraine based on the understanding that Ukrainians are not fighting only for themselves and for us, but instead of us. I can say it as a former defense minister, because we saw in 2016-17, on the other side of our borders, 120,000 troops ready to go within 48 hours. These troops do not exist anymore. They were sent to Ukraine. They are dead. So that&apos;s why I&apos;m saying that you are fighting instead of us, and this knowledge is finally pretty widespread.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonian-foreign-minister-on-a-crucial-time-for-ukraine-and-europe/	2025-01-06T08:25:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2G9A5189-004_00_08_41_13_Still005.jpg
End of Ukraine gas transit has no effect on EU energy market stability, European Commission says	The EU energy market remains stable following the end of the Russian gas transit through Ukraine, European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said at a briefing in Brussels on Jan. 6. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. &quot;We have been working intensely for over a year with our member states and with Ukraine as well to prepare in advance for this scenario,&quot; the spokesperson said. When asked about whether such a move caused any kind of emergency in Slovakia, she said that the Gas Coordination Group held talks last week and concluded that &quot;there are no security supplies issues or concerns for the European Union following the end of the transit.&quot; &quot;The markets had already factored in at the end of transit agreement. And we have not seen price spikes in the new year,&quot; Itkonen added. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries remain reliant on Russian gas. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. In his New Year&apos;s address, Fico said that stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine would have &quot;radical consequences&quot; for everyone in the European Union, but not for Russia. Fico &#xA0;claimed that gas and electricity prices in Europe would rise. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/end-of-ukraine-gas-transit-deal-has-no-effect-on-eu-energy-market-stability-european-commission-says/	2025-01-06T08:21:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Engine failures ground two Russian airliners shortly after takeoff, local media reports	Two Russian airliners were forced to return to their departure airports due to engine failures shortly after takeoff, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 4, citing Russian media. Western sanctions imposed after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have severely impacted the country&#x2019;s aviation industry. Cut off from parts and support from Western manufacturers, Russian airlines have struggled to maintain aircraft. An Airbus A321neo operated by Ural Airlines experienced a left engine failure at an altitude of 4,500 meters (2.7 miles) on Jan. 4 while flying from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to Yekaterinburg. The crew reported the malfunction and returned to the departure airport. Similarly, a Boeing 737 belonging to NordStar Airlines suffered a left engine failure at 11,300 meters (7 miles) during a flight from Volgograd to Ekaterinburg on Jan. 2, prompting its crew to return to Gumrak airport in Volgograd. The airlines confirmed that both planes have been grounded for technical inspections and condition assessments. According to Russia&apos;s Izvestia newspaper, as of Nov. 13, about 30 Russian airlines &#x2014; accounting for 26% of domestic passenger traffic &#x2014; face potential bankruptcy in 2025 due to accumulated debts and difficulties leasing foreign aircraft. In the meantime, Russia has struggled to reduce its reliance on foreign-made passenger jets, as seen in a deadly crash in July 2024. A domestically-produced Sukhoi Superjet 100 crashed in a forest near Moscow during a test flight following scheduled maintenance, killing all three crew members on board, state-controlled TASS news agency reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/engine-failures-ground-two-russian-airliners-shortly-after-takeoff-the-moscow-times-reports/	2025-01-06T07:36:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
Absurd versions' — Azerbaijan's president accuses Russia, condemns Putin’s denial of involvement in plane crash	Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev again accused Russia of causing the Dec. 25 crash of Airlines Flight J2-8243, which killed 38 people, and criticized Vladimir Putin for not admitting guilt during a Jan. 6 meeting with victims&#x2019; families and surviving crew members. The flight, en route from Baku to Grozny, Chechnya, changed course and crashed in Kazakhstan. Multiple reports and official Azerbaijani statements attributed the disaster to a missile launched by a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. &quot;The blame for this disaster lies with representatives of the Russian Federation,&quot; he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has maintained close ties with Azerbaijan, offered condolences during a Dec. 28 phone call but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility. Aliyev criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. Aliyev also blamed Russia for failing to close its airspace near Grozny and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy. Aliyev said the plane&#x2019;s black boxes were decoded in Brazil at Azerbaijan&#x2019;s insistence, bypassing the Interstate Aviation Committee due to doubts about its objectivity. Flight J2-8243 carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Official Azerbaijani sources confirmed that the missile responsible originated from Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/absurd-versions-azerbaijans-president-accuses-russia-condemns-putins-denial-in-crash-case/	2025-01-06T07:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166759797.jpg
SBU behind drone attack on one of Russia's largest sea trade ports in Leningrad Oblast, source claims	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted a drone attack on one of Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaports, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast on Jan. 4, an intelligence source told The Kyiv Independent on Jan. 6. According to the source, Ukrainian long-range drones flew over 900 kilometers (559 miles) and almost reached St. Petersburg. The source shared a video purporting to show one of the drones hitting gas condensate tanks. One tank was heavily damaged, and three others suffered damage from explosive debris, they added. Experts suggest that it will take at least a month to repair the facility and will lead to interruptions in the terminal&apos;s operations. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukrainian drones attack Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaport, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast on Jan. 4, 2025. (SBU source)&quot;The Ust-Luga terminal is a major logistics hub in the Baltic Sea. &#xA0;Russia sells oil and gas via it with the help of the &apos;shadow fleet.&apos; Drone sanctions from the SBU reduce the flow of currency that Russia needs to wage war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Jan. 4 attack on the Russian port in Leningrad Oblast is not the first attack of its kind. On Jan. 24, 2024, Novatek&apos;s gas-condensate plant caught fire at the port of Ust-Luga following a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets deep inside Russian territory. The Ust-Luga Commercial Seaport began operations in December 2001 with the opening of a coal terminal. In the early 2020s, it became one of the largest seaports in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-behind-drone-attack-on/	2025-01-06T06:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-06-163358.png
Russian troops allegedly kill 3 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Russian troops have allegedly killed three Ukrainian prisoners of war in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel on Jan. 6. According to DeepState, a crowd-sourced information-gathering website on Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Russian forces tied the soldiers&apos; hands and shot them in the back of the head. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. &quot;On Jan. 3, near the village of Neskuchne, Volnovakha district, Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers committed a heinous crime &#x2014; they allegedly shot three Ukrainian prisoners of war,&quot; Lubinets said. The ombudsman added he would immediately appeal to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations. Russian forces have summarily executed 109 Ukrainian POWs in 2024 alone, Lubinets said in December. Executing prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-allegedly-kill-3-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-06T06:29:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg

Ukraine strikes 3 Russian air defense systems in single day, Navy claims	Two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged or destroyed by Ukraine&apos;s Navy in one day, the military branch claimed on Jan. 6. &quot;Our soldiers continue to turn Russian equipment into scrap metal,&quot; Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said in a Facebook post referring to the three successful attacks. In his post, Neizhpapa shared a video apparently depicting a drone zeroing in on a Russian Pantsir-S1 vehicle, claiming that the two Pantsir-S1 were destroyed in the occupied territory of Ukraine&#x2019;s Kherson Oblast. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show a Ukrainian strike against a Russian Pantsir air defense system. Footage published on Jan. 6, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s Navy/Telegram)Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the Navy&apos;s claims nor the extent of the damage done to the Russian anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. Russia has lost 1,034 air defense systems since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported before the news of the three successful hits surfaced.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-3-russian-air-defense-systems-in-single-day-navy-claims/	2025-01-06T06:05:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Picture1.png
Lukashenko's spox denies apology to Zelensky for Belarus's involvement in Russia's war	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko did not apologize to President Volodymyr Zelensky for Belarus&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lukashenko&apos;s spokesperson Natalia Eismont told RBC news agency on Jan. 6. Her claims came after Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman that Lukashenko apologized for Minsk&apos;s involvement in the war shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. &quot;No apologies have been made by the Belarusian president to Zelensky, for the simple reason that we have nothing to apologize for,&quot; Eismont said. According to the spokesperson, Lukashenko and Zelensky held a phone call due to the &quot;emotional reaction&quot; of Lukashenko&apos;s son Nikolai, who had the number of Ukraine&apos;s president. Lukashenko said that Zelensky would be &quot;responsible for the deaths of people&quot; and urged him to negotiate with Russia, Eismont claimed. Zelensky also said that Lukashenko proposed Kyiv to strike the Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus. Eismont did not comment on these claims. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. The country is also reportedly hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory. Russian troops operated a torture chamber in the Belarusian town of Naroulia in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported in late November. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenkos-spox-denies-he-apologized-to-zelensky-for-belarus-involvement-in-war/	2025-01-06T05:59:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184329199.jpg
Macron sees no 'quick and easy solution' to Ukraine, urges 'realistic' discussions on territory	French President Emmanuel Macron on Jan. 6 called on Ukraine to have &quot;realistic discussions on territorial issues&quot; as they alone can conduct them. &quot;There will be no quick and easy solution in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said in an address to French ambassadors in the Elysee Palace. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has previously vowed to bring both sides to the negotiating table and swiftly end the war. &quot;The U.S. must help us to change the nature of the situation and convince Russia to come to the negotiating table,&quot; Macron said in comments quoted by France24. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military currently lacks the strength to retake all of it by force, noting that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. In his address, the French head of state warned of repercussions for Europe and the U.S. should Ukraine emerge from the war on the losing side. &quot;The new American president himself knows that the U.S. has no chance of winning anything if Ukraine loses,&quot; Macron said. France&apos;s president also said that it would be up to European countries to &quot;build security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, a statement in line with his calls for greater European strategic autonomy. Paris has spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers to Ukraine after a possible ceasefire deal is reached. Trump, who vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict, has reportedly backed the idea, while Russia has rejected it. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, Ukraine&apos;s military setbacks, and Russia&apos;s growing economic difficulties have contributed to expectations of possible peace talks in 2025. Kyiv&apos;s allies have said they seek to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for any possible negotiations, with German government saying on Jan. 6 that peace cannot be &quot;dictated&quot; from Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-on-talks-in-ukraine/	2025-01-06T05:37:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Russia seeks to restore barge barriers protecting Crimean Bridge lost due to storms, Navy says	Russia is attempting to deploy new barge barriers near the Kerch Bridge in occupied Crimea instead of the destroyed ones, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said on Jan. 6. The barriers form part of a network of measures, both on land and sea, set up by Moscow to protect the bridge after multiple successful Ukrainian attacks. Speaking on national television, Pletenchuk confirmed that they were damaged due to storms in the Black Sea. &quot;Still, of course, they (Russia) are taking maximum measures to protect this illegal construction (the Crimean Bridge),&quot; Pletenchuk said. &quot;And so far, there are no tendencies to reduce their activity.&quot; The bridge is also equipped with layered air defense systems, he added. The 19-kilometer-long (12 miles) Crimean Bridge, constructed following Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and completed in 2018, serves as a vital supply route for Russian forces. The bridge has been targeted by Ukraine multiple times, suffering heavy damage in strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. The Crimean Bridge remains a focal point of the conflict and is also the subject of a legal dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-restore-barge-barriers-near-crimean-bridge-lost-due-to-storm-navy-says/	2025-01-06T05:23:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1243812201.jpg
Russian agents plotted terror attack near Kyiv by blowing up 16-year-old co-conspirator, SBU claims	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) uncovered a group of Russian agents who planned to carry out a mass terror attack involving a 16-year-old boy against a Ukrainian military unit in Kyiv Oblast, the SBU claimed on Jan. 6. The boy, disguised as a soldier, was allegedly instructed to plant explosives at an entrance to a military facility premises in December 2024. The plotters then intended to detonate the explosives remotely, killing the boy as well, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said, adding that the boy was not aware he was to be killed as part of the attack. Russia has been repeatedly accused of recruiting underage Ukrainians for sabotage operations against the Ukrainian military across the country. The four suspects accused of involvement in the plot acted separately but under instructions of a single Russian handler, the SBU said. The weapons for the alleged terror attack had been previously manufactured by two residents of Vinnytsia Oblast. The boy arrived in Kyiv Oblast and settled in a hotel. According to the statement, he picked up a backpack with an explosive device and a military uniform left in a designated place. They were brought there earlier by another 19-year-old man, the SBU said. After changing his clothes, the minor arrived at the place and planted the explosives, which were disguised in the backpack, the SBU said. The counterintelligence agency reportedly uncovered the plot in advance and prevented the terror attack. All four suspects were detained. If charged, they can face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-uncovers-kyiv-oblast-terror-plot/	2025-01-06T04:54:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/0a9d0656fdd6e9503abfadc642f1b181.jpeg
Transnistria's electricity supply system faces collapse amid gas shortage, Moldovan official warns	The electricity supply system in the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria is at risk of collapse after the halt of Russian gas flow, a high-ranking official of Moldova&#x2019;s Energy Ministry warned on Jan. 5. There is about a 65 megawatt (MW) growth in demand for electricity as residents of Transnistria use electric devices to heat their homes, said Constant Borosan, a state secretary at the ministry. &quot;This overloaded the networks and created a shortage of about 65 MW (megawatts) of electricity in the region.&quot; Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz, Moldova&apos;s state-owned gas company. The halt of gas supplies resulted in a heating outage in Transnistria. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region, occupied by Russia since the early 1990s, is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Borosan said rolling blackouts began in the region, mainly during the peak consumption hours of morning and evening, to avoid overloading the energy grid. As Moldova&#x2019;s and Transnistria&#x2019;s energy grids are heavily interconnected, power should be saved in the government-controlled part of the country as well, the official added. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria were without heating and hot water on Jan. 4, and nearly 72,000 homes remained without gas, the region&#x2019;s leader said, urging residents to heat with stoves and fire amid dropping temperatures.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistrias-electricity-supply-system-faces-collapse-moldovan-official-warns/	2025-01-06T04:15:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Pro-government Slovak MPs to travel to Moscow to 'restore some relations'	A group of pro-government Slovak lawmakers plan to visit Moscow later in January to develop &quot;dialogue&quot; with Russia, according to Andrej Danko, the chair of the co-ruling far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) who will take part in the delegation, the Slovak news agency TASR reported on Jan. 5. Danko, a Russian-friendly nationalist who serves as the parliament deputy speaker, announced in early December his intent to visit Russia, weeks before Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Fico&apos;s Slovak government has been consistently critical of military support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. More recently, Bratislava threatened Kyiv with cutting energy and humanitarian support after Ukraine did not prolong the transit deal on Russian gas flowing to Slovakia and other EU countries via Ukrainian pipelines. &quot;We want to understand certain positions, legislature, and restore some relations with Russia,&quot; Danko noted, presenting the trip as a continuation of Fico&apos;s visit on Dec. 22. The six-member delegation, which will include lawmakers from Danko&apos;s SNS and Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, is expected to meet representatives of the Russian government and the parliament. &quot;We want to open the eyes of the people in Slovakia,&quot; Danko said, talking about the supposed importance of Russian gas and Russia&apos;s business ties with Western companies. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts at weaning itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. Fico was not the first Slovak official to visit Russia last year. Lubos Blaha, a pro-Kremlin member of the European Parliament for the Smer party, visited Moscow in October 2024, praising Russia as &quot;beautiful, wise, and advanced&quot; and calling for an end to hatred towards the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-mps-to-travel-to-moscow/	2025-01-06T03:45:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1204098217.jpg
Ukraine to receive another 180,000 rounds of ammunition for Gepard systems from Germany	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has ordered another 180,000 rounds of 35 mm ammunition for self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns from the German Rheinmetall arms manufacturer, the company announced on Jan. 6. The order for a new batch of rounds of HEI-T ammunition (High Explosive Incendiary with Tracer) was booked in December 2024 and is funded by the German government. The start of delivery is expected in 2026, according to Rheinmetall. Berlin sent 55 Gepards to Ukraine, which had been decommissioned by Germany&apos;s Armed Forces. &quot;They have proven their value in air defense for more than two years,&quot; the statement read. The Gepard, a German-designed weapon first introduced into service in the 1970s, was designed for use against planes and helicopters. It is also seen as highly effective against drones, including the Shahed-type ones, which Russia uses in daily attacks against Ukraine. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-another-180-000-rounds-of-ammunition-for-gepard-systems/	2025-01-06T03:28:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1556779740.jpg
‘They didn’t give a s**t’ — Zelensky rebukes those behind Budapest Memorandum	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview published on Jan. 5 that those responsible for pressuring Kyiv to sign the Budapest Memorandum should be jailed, and signatory countries who gave security assurances &quot;didn&#x2019;t give a s**t&quot; about Ukraine. Speaking in the interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelensky said Ukraine tried multiple times to have the terms of the agreement enforced but received no responses. The Budapest Memorandum was signed on Dec. 5, 1994, and saw Ukraine sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and give up nuclear weapons left on its territory after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In exchange, Kyiv received security assurances from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. China and France gave weaker assurances at the same time. All countries agreed to engage in varying levels of consultations in the event of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity being threatened. Twenty years after signing the agreement, Russia launched a war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years in, Russia is now actively conducting a full-scale offensive against Ukraine. In the interview with Fridman, Zelensky said Ukrainian officials requested consultations three times over several years from the start of Russia&#x2019;s aggression in 2014. &quot;Everyone should be in consultation. Everyone must come. Everyone must meet urgently, the U.S., Britain, Russia, France, China,&quot; he said. &quot;Did anyone come, you ask? No. Did anyone reply to these letters, official letters? They are all recorded by diplomats. Did anyone conduct consultations? &quot;No, and why not? They didn&#x2019;t give a s**t.&quot; Zelensky said Ukraine was pressured into signing the Budapest Memorandum, and those who came up with the agreement should be jailed. &quot;We were under the pressure of the U.S. and Russia for Ukraine to give up (nuclear weapons). These two powers were exerting pressure,&quot; he said. &quot;These two states negotiated to ensure that Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons. Ukraine agreed. Now we just need to find these people, and we just need to put in jail all of those who, frankly, invented all this.&quot; Last year marked the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, an occasion Zelensky remarked on during his evening address on Dec. 5. &quot;Today marks 30 years of the Budapest Memorandum. Ten years of war. Not a single day did this document work,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. &quot;And because of this, everyone in the world will now know that a mere signature &#x2014; by any state &#x2014; or any assurances or promises are not enough for security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-rebukes-budapest-memorandum-signatories/	2025-01-06T03:26:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Ukraine's military is 980,000 soldiers strong, Zelensky says	Ukraine has 980,000 people in arms as it fights Russia&apos;s all-out war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as the largest in Europe. This, however, excludes Russia, whose military personnel exceeded 1 million at the onset of the full-scale invasion, with Moscow aiming to raise this number to 1.5 million. &quot;The Ukrainian army is the largest in Europe. The second place after us (France) is four times smaller than us,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I think the French have about 200,000. We have 980,000.&quot; Critics push for even more, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army has been on the back foot on the front line during 2024, partially due to a manpower shortage that analysts attributed to the country&#x2019;s demographics and a disjointed mobilization process. Ukraine lowered the mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but resisted the international partners&apos; calls to further lower it to 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-is-980-000-soldiers-strong-zelensky-says/	2025-01-06T02:55:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1653684500.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and wounded 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 6. Overnight, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with two Kh-59 aerial missiles, as well as 128 Shahed-type drones and dummy drones, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. The air defense shot down the two Kh-59 missiles as well as 79 drones over 11 oblasts, while 49 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. One person was killed, and 13 others were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attacks on the city of Kherson and 38 other regional settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A man was killed, and a woman was injured in the Russian military&#x2019;s attack in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. Seven people were also injured in Donetsk Oblast as a result of Russia&#x2019;s attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2-injure-21-over-past-day/	2025-01-06T02:17:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-06_10-21-31.jpg
Russia claims to capture Kurakhove, Ukraine says fighting ongoing in the sector	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, a statement not confirmed by Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported on Jan. 6 that battles are ongoing in the Kurakhove sector as Russia &quot;conducts assault operations in the urban area of Kurakhove in the direction of Petropavlivka and Dachne.&quot; The reports come amid heavy Russian offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast that took a long-unseen pace in the fall of 2024. &quot;Measures are underway to identify and destroy Russian assault groups trying to infiltrate our battle formations,&quot; the Khortytsia group said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russian forces have focused their effort at Kurakhove in southwestern Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning it into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said on Jan. 6 that over the past day, Ukrainian forces repelled 27 ground assaults near Kurakhove, Petropavlivka, Dachne, and Slovianka. The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, with Moscow&apos;s forces apparently advancing west toward Dachne. If confirmed, this would make Kurakhove the first major town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after capturing Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts at Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-kurakhove/	2025-01-06T01:41:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899885.jpg
Ukraine's position in Kursk Oblast important for possible negotiations, Blinken says	Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia, the AFP news agency reported. The Biden administration, whose term expires in a few weeks, has sped up the delivery of military assistance to Ukraine to put Kyiv in the strongest possible position in potential peace negotiations. &quot;Their (Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; Blinken told reporters in Seoul. The comments come at the heels of reports of Ukraine launching new offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after months of being on the defensive. Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion in early August, allegedly seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Moscow has deployed reinforcements, including thousands of North Korean soldiers, and reportedly recaptured around half of the lost territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky also called the Kursk incursion an important &quot;trump card&quot; in any potential talks. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Trump&apos;s return to the White House sparked concerns among Ukraine&apos;s allies due to the president-elect&apos;s past criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s support for Kyiv. In comments made since his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the country, instead aiming to leverage Washington&apos;s aid to push Russia to negotiate.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-positions-in-kursk-oblast-crucial-for-possible-negotiations-blinken-says/	2025-01-06T01:23:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2174582366.jpg
Ukraine has received less than half of US assistance allocated during full-scale war, Zelensky says	Ukraine has not received even half of the $177 billion the U.S. allocated to support Kyiv throughout the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman released on Jan. 5. Zelensky implied that this development may have been linked to corruption or lobbying on the side of U.S. companies. Ukraine&apos;s head of state said this in response to Fridman&apos;s question about corruption concerns in Ukraine. The U.S. has become Ukraine&apos;s top supporter, providing the largest amount of military assistance to resist Russian aggression. Voices critical of Washington&apos;s support have often cited corruption risks and dangers of the illicit arms trade, though U.S. watchdogs have closely monitored the assistance. While acknowledging corruption in Ukraine, Zelensky said that his country works hard to combat it through the &quot;most complex&quot; anti-corruption system in Europe. He also said that what would be called &quot;corruption&quot; in Ukraine might be called &quot;lobbyism&quot; elsewhere. &quot;If we had $177 billion and if we get the half, where is the second half? If you find the second half, you will find corruption,&quot; Zelensky commented in the wide-ranging three-hour interview. Zelensky provided an example of him allegedly appealing to Washington to bring in U.S. arms using Ukraine&apos;s own fleet of cargo planes not to pay for the transport. &quot;No. I didn&apos;t get this opportunity. My jets stayed put, and the U.S. jets, cargo jets moved these weapons. But everywhere you have to spend money,&quot; Zelensky added, saying that Ukraine could have spent this money to buy more arms instead of paying for expensive transport to U.S. companies. &quot;Is this corruption or not? Or lobbyism?&quot; the president asked, saying that he has been reluctant to talk about such causes so as not to cause a scandal that could lead to the halt of aid. The president stressed that Ukraine does not profit from the war and that such claims stem from Russian propaganda, adding that Ukrainian authorities strictly punish anybody who attempts to profit from it. Ukraine has made strides to combat corruption since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but civil society groups and activists have raised the alarm about the anti-graft efforts slowing down during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-received-less-than-half-of-us-assistance-allocated-during-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2025-01-06T00:31:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
US to introduce 'big package' of sanctions on Russia’s shadow fleet, individuals, Reuters reports	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration plans to introduce a &quot;big package&quot; of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet and individuals, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Despite Western efforts to reduce Russia&#x2019;s income from oil funding its war against Ukraine, Moscow has been able to bypass sanctions and sell Russian oil above the imposed price cap of $60 per barrel with the buildup of a fleet of aging vessels with dubious ownership. Washington&#x2019;s planned sanctions would aim at tankers carrying Russian oil above the imposed price cap and individuals working in schemes to sell crude above the cap, Reuters reported. &quot;It is going to be a big package,&quot; one of the sources was quoted as saying by the news agency. In a decision in late 2022, G7 countries, along with the EU and Australia, imposed rules on Western operators, permitting them to insure and transport Russian oil only if it is sold below the established threshold of $60 per barrel. That prompted Russia to redirect its flows to China and India, countries willing to purchase the oil above the cap, using hundreds of old tankers that also pose a grave environmental risk. The U.S. only sanctions a handful of them, Reuters reported. In a separate initiative, G7 countries discussed in late 2024 the possibility of lowering the price cap to $40 per barrel, but no consensus has been reached as projections show softening oil prices for 2025. Ukraine has also targeted Russia&apos;s oil infrastructure through drone strikes, further disrupting production. Several Russian refineries, including those in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk, have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. The sector has been forced to sell fuel at a discount and operate under high interest rates, adding strain to its operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-introduce-big-package-of-sanctions-on-russias-shadow-fleet-individuals-reuters-reports/	2025-01-06T00:03:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
He's sending 18-year-old boys' to die — Zelensky says Putin doesn't love his country	Russian President Vladimir Putin does not love his country and people as he is sending Russia&apos;s youth to die in his wars of aggression, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman released on Jan. 5. &quot;He does not love his people. He loves only his inner circle,&quot; Zelensky said in response to Fridman&apos;s suggestion that Putin is a &quot;serious person who loves his country.&quot; &quot;What is his country? He happened to consider Ukraine his country,&quot; the president responded in the three-hour-long interview, pointing out that Putin had previously also launched a destructive war against Chechnya, now a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Putin rose to power during the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, in which Russia forcibly subjugated the region and seized its capital, Grozny, after a devastating siege. &quot;Who are the Chechens? A different people: Another faith&#x2026; Another language. One million people eliminated&#x2026;. How did he kill them &#x2013; with love?&quot; Zelensky asked rhetorically. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also stressed that Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine resulted in 780,000 of its soldiers killed or wounded, adding that Putin &quot;calls them all Russians, even those who don&apos;t know how to speak Russian, on his territory of Russia, everything they&apos;ve enslaved.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s (Putin) sending 18-year-boys (to die in war)... It&apos;s not that the fascists came to his country, and he needs to defend it. He came to ours, and he sends them,&quot; Zelensky continued, providing other examples of Moscow&apos;s wars and military interventions in Syria, Chechnya, Georgia, and Africa. Though the exact Russian losses in the full-scale invasion are difficult to establish with certainty, The Economist wrote that they already outpace Moscow&apos;s battlefield losses in all of its post-1945 wars combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/hes-sending-18-year-old-boys-to-die-zelensky-says-putin-doesnt-love-his-country/	2025-01-05T22:57:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 798,040 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 798,040 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 6. This number includes 1,550 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,700 tanks, 20,164 armored fighting vehicles, 33,056 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,665 artillery systems, 1,258 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,034 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,625 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-798-040-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-05T22:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Canadian PM Justin Trudeau expected to announce resignation in coming days, media reports	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on or before Jan. 8, Canada&apos;s Globe and Mail reported on Jan. 5, citing three unnamed sources. It remains unclear if Trudeau will remain as prime minister on an interim basis as a new Liberal Party leader is selected, or whether he will step down immediately. Trudeau, who has faced slumping poll numbers over the past year, has faced increased pressure from Liberal Members of Parliament to resign following the abrupt resignation of Trudeau&apos;s finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. Freeland, who also served as deputy prime minister, resigned from the ministerial post on Dec. 16 after she was told by Trudeau that she would be replaced imminently. The decision drew heavy criticism from government MPs, with dozens of his parliamentary caucus members calling for his resignation. Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015, is expected to resign ahead of his party&apos;s national caucus meeting on Wednesday, and may do so as early as Jan. 6, the Globe and Mail reported. Trudeau, who holds a minority government in Canada&apos;s parliament, lost a key partner in propping up the Liberal government in September, with the announcement by New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh that he would &quot;rip up&quot; a supply and confidence agreement with the government. Canada&apos;s next federal election is scheduled for October 2025, but will likely occur in the next few months as opposition parties have vowed to vote &quot;no confidence&quot; in the government during the next sitting of parliament which is scheduled to begin Jan. 27. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has consistently polled far ahead of Trudeau in public opinion polls and would likely win a majority government if an election were held today. Canada, under Trudeau, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance for Ukraine, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian background and fluent in Ukrainian, served as the government&apos;s most vocal supporter of Ukraine. Previous to her career in politics, Freeland served as Moscow bureau chief for the Financial Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-expected-announce-resignation-in-coming-days-media-reports-2/	2025-01-05T21:53:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1683460359.jpg
Lukashenko apologized to Zelensky for Belarus' role, denied responsibility early in Russia's invasion, Zelensky says	Shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko apologized to President Volodymyr Zelensky over the country&apos;s involvement in the war, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;A few days into the war, I spoke with Lukashenko on the phone, and he apologized... he said, &apos;It was not me, missiles were launched from my territory, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was the one launching them.&apos; These are his words, I have witnesses,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview. &quot;&apos;And I apologize,&apos; he said. &apos;But believe me&apos; &#x2014; that&apos;s what he told me &#x2014; &apos;Volodya (referring to Volodymyr Zelensky), this is not me. I&#x2019;m not in charge,&apos;&quot; Zelensky added. In response, Zelensky said that he called Lukashenko &quot;a murderer,&quot; questioning why Lukashenko allowed Russia to launch missiles at Ukraine from Belarusian territory. Lukashenko became increasingly reliant on Russia after isolating Belarus from the West, following Belarus&apos; 2020 election. Lukashenko&apos;s opposition and the West condemned the results as fraudulent. Lukashenko cracked down on mass protests that broke out in response to the fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory. Lukashenko asked Putin on Dec. 6 to deploy the Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, a weapon Russia recently used to strike Ukraine, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. As many as 10 missile systems will be deployed, according to pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev. Belarus will be holding its next presidential election on Jan. 26 where Lukashenko is expected to be handed a seventh term in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-apologized-to-zelensky-for-russias-full-scale-invasion-zelensky-says/	2025-01-05T19:38:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1507107219.jpg
Zelensky offered to buy weapons from incoming Trump administration with frozen Russian assets	President Volodymyr Zelensky previously offered U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Ukraine to buy American weapons at the expense of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;This is one of the security guarantees. Take the money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States. We don&apos;t need gifts from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview with Fridman. &quot;It will be very good for your industry. For the United States. We will put money there. Russian money. Not Ukrainian. Not European. Russian money. Russian assets. They have to pay for this,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky did not comment on Trump&apos;s reaction to the suggestion. Trump and his team have been critical of U.S. spending to support Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&apos;s appointed National Security Advisor for his upcoming term said on Dec. 15 that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy.&quot; Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. Zelensky has taken steps to foster a positive relationship with Trump, despite previously having a fraught relationship stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial. The two leaders met on Sept. 27 in the midst of the U.S. presidential election campaign. They met again on the sidelines of the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Dec. 7. &quot;He (Trump) is strong... He is young... and his brains work,&quot; Zelensky said when asked why he thinks Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-offers-to-buy-weapons-from-the-us-with-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-01-05T17:38:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
North Korean troops have sustained 3,800 casualties in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	A total of 3,800 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman on Jan. 5. Pyongyang sent upwards of 12,000 North Korean soldiers into Kursk Oblast in the fall of 2024, amid an agreement to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region which began on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Zelensky, in his wide-ranging interview with Lex Fridman, added that Pyongyang has the capabilities to bring additional North Korean troops to the front, as many as 30,000 -40,000 troops. Ukraine reportedly ramped up its operations in Kursk Oblast with a new offensive on Jan. 5, with mixed reports surfacing on outcome of the renewed push from Kyiv. The renewed offensive comes amid significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes, Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect &#x2014; amounting to high casualty totals. Kirby added that North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Ukraine and Russia are rushing to make up ground in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes power on Jan. 2o. Trump has previously said he would end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; with potential peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. The comments come as Ukraine has steadily lost ground in the region amid Russian counterattacks. Ukraine has reportedly lost over 40% of territory it previously gained in due to renewed Russian efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/3800-north-korean-casualties-zelensky-says/	2025-01-05T15:30:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine launches new offensive in Russia's Kursk Oblast, mixed reports surface on outcome	Key developments on Jan. 4 - 5: Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Jan. 5. Reports by Russian pro-war Telegram channels have echoed the statement, saying that a new Kyiv offensive is underway. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian troops repelled two offensives conducted by Ukrainian assault groups in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 5. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify these claims at the time of publication. The reports come as Moscow has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a small piece of Russian territory in the hopes of gaining leverage in possible future negotiations. Roman Alyokhin, a Russian pro-war blogger and a former advisor to Kursk Oblast&apos;s governor, claimed that Kyiv launched an attack northeast of Sudzha toward the village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, using armored vehicles and demining equipment. According to him, the Ukrainian army also &quot;intensified its actions&quot; in other areas of Kursk Oblast. Kovalenko said that Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, which &quot;came as a surprise to them.&quot; &quot;Kursk Oblast, good news! Russia is getting what it deserves,&quot; Andrii Yermak, head of the President&apos;s Office, wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has not publicly reported any new operations in Kursk Oblast. Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Jan. 5 that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov had arrived in Kursk. It was not immediately clear whether this visit was related to the ongoing activity in the region. Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, achieving initial tactical success. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the back foot as Russia reportedly recaptured half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect. Russia launched more than 300 drones and 20 missiles, including ballistic missiles, at Ukrainian cities and villages over the first three days of the new year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 3. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. Zelensky added that the Russian army also strikes settlements close to the front line with guided aerial bombs every day. &quot;Such Russian terror, which is not decreasing its intensity, requires us and all our partners to continue to build our air shield and all its systemic elements, from patriots to mobile fire groups,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is necessary to replenish the stock of anti-missiles for air defense constantly. We need to increase the capacity of mobile fire groups constantly. I am grateful to all the partners who help us.&quot; The president also announced meetings and talks next week to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense. The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton. Russian troops are disguising themselves as civilians to bypass Ukrainian military positions in the Toretsk sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast, commander of the mortar battery of the presidential brigade, call sign &quot;Mozok&quot; (&quot;Brain&quot;), told Suspilne on Jan. 3. The commander&apos;s statement comes after reports on Russian forces starting to move toward the town of Toretsk. Fighting with armored combat vehicles, motorcycles, and buggies took place in the village of Nelipivka, located south of Toretsk, in late December. The soldier, whose name is undisclosed for security reasons, said that after passing Ukrainian positions, Russian soldiers disguised as civilians either wait for reinforcements or use anti-tank mines to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;Some of the soldiers are former prisoners. They are tasked with smuggling anti-tank mines and throwing them into the area of our firing positions when the fighters cannot be knocked out during regular battles. They are trying to blow up buildings where our guys are located,&quot; the soldier told Suspilne. Small infantry groups are also trying to storm and bypass positions under the cover of fog, he added. Toretsk has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes in Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region. &quot;In battles yesterday and today near a single village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. He added that &quot;this is significant.&quot; While Zelensky did not share further details, a battalion typically consists of several hundred troops. In late 2024, Zelensky also called on China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the front line. &quot;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. According to Zelensky, Russian troops launched more than 630 attack drones, around 740 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types this week, targeting settlements across Ukraine. Overnight alone, 103 Shahed-type drones launched against Ukraine contained 8,755 foreign-made components, the president said. Ukraine shot down 61 drones, the Air Force said. Another 42 drones were &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;The sanctions pressure on supply chains for foreign components remains insufficient,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia continues to acquire the components and manufacturing tools it needs &#x2014; almost globally &#x2014; and uses them in the weapons it employs to terrorize Ukraine.&quot; The president urged partners to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air-defense and long-range capabilities, as well as strengthen sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-52/	2025-01-05T10:56:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Uzbek court sentences man for participating in war against Ukraine on Russian side	A court in Uzbekistan sentenced a 39-year-old man to four years and two months of restricted freedom for participating in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, gazeta.uz reported on Jan. 5. The man traveled to Moscow in April 2023 seeking seasonal work and later joined the Russian Armed Forces, after undergoing military training for two months at a military base in Moscow. He then fought in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts until December 2023, and admitted to killing ten Ukrainian soldiers. According to his claims, he was promised a monthly combat salary of 450,000 rubles but only received two payments of 150,000 rubles before the payments stopped. The defendant admitted to financial hardship as the motivation for joining and voluntarily surrendered upon returning to Uzbekistan. The court took into account his admission of guilt, remorse, and clean criminal record when determining the sentence. In Uzbekistan, mercenary activities are punishable by up to 10 years, and another similar case recently resulted in a five-year prison sentence. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Uzbekistan declared that it did not recognize the proxy authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and supported Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. However, Tashkent continues to actively trade with Moscow, and the Uzbek government maintains close ties with the Russian leadership.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbek-court-sentences-man-for-participating-in-the-russian-army-against-ukraine/	2025-01-05T09:11:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1257504169.jpg
Syrskyi orders to reinforce French-trained brigade with drones after reports of mismanagement	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered to boost Ukraine&apos;s 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade with drones after reports of desertion and mismanagement, he said on Jan. 5. &quot;I paid special attention to building up the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th Mechanized Brigade, as well as to the problematic issues that need to be resolved,&quot; Syrskyi said. His remarks came following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched an investigation. Sysrkyi&apos;s statement marks the first time that the military leadership mentioned the 155th Brigade, although without elaborating on the details of the scandal. Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net, claimed on Jan. 4, citing the outlet&apos;s unnamed sources, that President Volodymyr Zelensky held a meeting with the military and top officials and &quot;took the investigation under his control.&quot; The brigade is a flagship project under which NATO countries will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv Rus princess and spouse of French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. According to Butusov, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. The 155th Brigade reportedly also did not receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command. This, in addition to poor organization and insufficient training, is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in November. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-orders-to-reinforce-french-trained-brigade-with-drones-after-reports-of-mismanagement/	2025-01-05T07:59:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245863177.jpg
Scholz denies claims that he could meet with Putin in Russia	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected on Jan. 5 claims that he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of February, RND reported. Roderich Kiesewetter, defense spokesperson for Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on X that &quot;there are increasing indications that Chancellor Scholz will travel to Moscow and meet Putin before Feb. 23.&quot; &quot;That is a false claim. That is deeply indecent,&quot; Scholz said. Secretary General of Germany&apos;s governing Social Democratic Party (SPD) Matthias Miersch described Kiesewetter&apos;s post as &quot;extremely problematic, infamous and dishonest.&quot; He also said that this is a violation of the agreement &quot;on fair competition&quot; amid the upcoming elections. German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the &quot;legal steps&quot; over the CDU&apos;s spokesperson claims are being prepared. The CDU is currently leading in pre-election polls, with party leader Friedrich Merz widely seen as the frontrunner to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor. Scholz and Putin held their first phone conversation in nearly two years on Nov. 15, according to a German government statement. The hour-long call saw Scholz condemning Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urging Putin to withdraw troops from Ukraine and pursue a &quot;just and lasting peace&quot; through negotiations. Scholz reaffirmed Germany&apos;s &quot;unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 15 that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-denies-claims-that-he-could-meet-with-putin-in-russia/	2025-01-05T06:13:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190395993.jpg
More than 50,000 foreign parts found in Russian drones, missiles launched at Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Hundreds of drones, missiles and guided aerial bombs used by Russia to attack Ukraine this week contained overall more than 50,000 foreign components, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 5. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties.

Over 54,000 Russian targets were hit with Ukrainian drones in December, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian soldiers attacked more than 54,000 Russian targets with drones in December, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 5. A total of 49% of the targets were struck by kamikaze drones, according to Syrskyi. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. Russia increased the number of drones with fiber-optic control channels, which pose a threat to military equipment during their movement, Syrksyi said. According to the general, Ukrainian soldiers also started using fiber-optic FPV drones, &quot;which expands the capabilities to defeat and destroy Russian military equipment and personnel.&quot; The command also briefed Syrskyi on high-tech developments in the field of unmanned systems and electronic warfare and their use on the battlefield, as well as countering the latest models of Russian equipment. &quot;We are increasing the number of brigades with a reinforced unmanned component,&quot; the general said. &quot;We are finalizing the concept of using a separate unmanned systems brigade and its typical structure.&quot; Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-54-000-russian-targets-attacked-with-ukraines-drones-in-december-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-05T04:20:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Ukraine launches new offensive in Russia's Kursk Oblast, mixed reports surface on outcome	Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Jan. 5. Reports by Russian pro-war Telegram channels have echoed the statement, saying that a new Kyiv offensive is underway. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian troops repelled two offensives conducted by Ukrainian assault groups in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 5. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify these claims at the time of publication. The reports come as Moscow has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a small piece of Russian territory in the hopes of gaining leverage in possible future negotiations. Roman Alyokhin, a Russian pro-war blogger and a former advisor to Kursk Oblast&apos;s governor, claimed that Kyiv launched an attack northeast of Sudzha toward the village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, using armored vehicles and demining equipment. According to him, the Ukrainian army also &quot;intensified its actions&quot; in other areas of Kursk Oblast. Kovalenko said that Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, which &quot;came as a surprise to them.&quot; &quot;Kursk Oblast, good news! Russia is getting what it deserves,&quot; Andrii Yermak, head of the President&apos;s Office, wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has not publicly reported any new operations in Kursk Oblast. Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Jan. 5 that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov had arrived in Kursk. It was not immediately clear whether this visit was related to the ongoing activity in the region. Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, achieving initial tactical success. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the back foot as Russia reportedly recaptured half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-2/	2025-01-05T03:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166170923-1.jpg

The Ukrainian military had planned the ambush using FPV drones in advance, having obtained details of Melnikov&apos;s route and schedule, HUR said. Melnikov and his driver were traveling along the Vasylivka-Tokmak highway on Dec. 29, when the latter drove off the road due to a drone attack, according to the agency. &quot;Then the military intelligence officers hit the windshield with a kamikaze drone,&quot; HUR claimed, sharing footage showing the attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Storm Ossetia is a Russian assault unit within the 429th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. It was formed in Russia&apos;s Republic of North Ossetia-Alania in 2022 to take part in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-storm-ossetia-battalion-chief-of-staff-killed-in-ukrainian-drone-attack-military-intelligence-claims/	2025-01-05T02:10:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-05-114851.png

Ukrainian educator and philologist Oleksii Halionka killed in Chernihiv missile strike	Oleksii Halionka, a 72-year-old Ukrainian educator and philologist, was killed on 3 January 2025 when a Russian missile hit his home in Chernihiv. The attack, involving three ballistic missiles, struck residential areas, killing Halionka, injuring four others, and damaging several homes. Halionka had already suffered significant losses in 2022 when Russian forces destroyed his family home, along with a personal library of 4,000 books and other belongings. Since then, he had been living in a small building on the same property. &#x201C;He had big plans for life this year, including building a new house,&#x201D; his niece Liudmyla Halionka said in an interview with local media outlet Cheline. &#x201C;He was a very kind and sensitive person. It&#x2019;s a great loss for our family, for everyone.&#x201D; A well-known educator, Halionka authored over 100 publications and was an associate professor at the Regional Institute of Postgraduate Pedagogical Education. Local authorities confirmed the missiles targeted civilian infrastructure, leaving parts of the neighborhood heavily damaged. Chernihiv Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia, was partially occupied during the early stages of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Although Russian forces withdrew from the region in April 2022, Chernihiv remains under near-daily attack due to its proximity to the border.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-educator-and-philologist-oleksii-halionka-killed-in-chernihiv-missile-strike/	2025-01-04T20:57:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/halionka.png
Georgian businesses and employees to carry out nationwide strike demanding new elections	Georgian citizens are being urged to participate in a nationwide strike on Jan. 15 to demand the release of detained protestors and to call for new elections, Protest 24 posted on Facebook. The strike, organized by Protest 24, will begin at 3 p.m. and last for three hours, with businesses and employees halting work during this time. Organizers aim to highlight the potential consequences of political isolation, such as economic stagnation, unemployment, and poverty. The dissatisfaction of citizens, stemming from disputed parliamentary elections in October, has intensified with the controversial inauguration of Mikheil Kavelashvili and the government&#x2019;s stance against European integration. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. Protesters hope the strike will underscore public frustration and push for democratic reforms.	https://kyivindependent.com/nationwide-strike-in-demand-of-new-elections-announced-in-georgia/	2025-01-04T18:08:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg

German opposition suggests Scholz could meet Putin before end of February	Roderich Kiesewetter, defense spokesperson for Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said saidthat Chancellor Olaf Scholz could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Germany&apos;s parliamentary elections on Feb. 23. &quot;There are increasing indications that Chancellor Scholz will travel to Moscow and meet Putin before February 23,&quot; Kiesewetter said on X. &quot;For Ukraine, implementing the intended plans would mean, among other things, a suspension of the Paris Charter for 10 to 20 years. How the Ukrainian population or our neighbors react to all of this will be revealing.&quot; Kiesewetter criticized the potential meeting, warning that &quot;Ukraine must not be the object or the victim. Russia is up to its neck in economic and social terms, but Ukraine, which is in much worse shape, should be accommodated&#x2014;not Russia!&quot; He also cautioned that any negotiations at this time &quot;are at the expense of Ukraine and de facto mean submission.&quot; In his election campaign, Scholz has positioned himself as a &quot;chancellor of peace,&quot; advocating for both support for Ukraine and negotiations with Russia to end the war. However, Kiesewetter took aim at what he referred to as the &quot;so-called &apos;Moscow connection&apos;&quot; and called for greater clarity and resolve within Germany&apos;s leadership. The CDU is currently leading in pre-election polls, with party leader Friedrich Merz widely seen as the frontrunner to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor.

Heavy Russian, North Korean losses in Russia's Kursk region, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky reported significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes in Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region. &quot;In battles yesterday and today near a single village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. He added that &quot;this is significant.&quot; While Zelensky did not share further details, a battalion typically consists of several hundred troops. In late 2024, Zelensky also called on China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the front line. &quot;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/heavy-russian-north-korean-losses-in-russias-kursk-region-zelensky-says/	2025-01-04T11:33:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Over 20 foreign citizens to be deported from Georgia for participating in protests	The Georgian government is planning to deport 25 foreigners for participating in mass protests in November and December 2024, News Georgia reported on Jan. 4, citing a Georgian Interior Ministry statement. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. The Migration Department of the Georgian Interior Ministry has initiated expulsion proceedings against 25 foreign nationals who participated in the protests in Tbilisi in November and December. The court also imposed various administrative penalties on them. The ministry added that 10 out of 25 citizens have already left Georgia&apos;s territory, without specifying which countries they are citizens of. There are no official statistics on foreigners detained during the protests. Over 20 of the nearly 450 arrested were foreign nationals, most of them Russians, News Georgia reported, citing reports by NGOs and other media. In December, foreigners who attended the protests began to be summoned en masse to the Migration Department. Human rights activists noted that this practice did not comply with international standards and warned that the deportation of foreign nationals for participating in peaceful demonstrations was contrary to national law. Some 91 foreigners were ordered to leave the country between November and December 2024. According to News Georgia, more than a quarter of them participated in anti-government protests. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. The parliamentary elections and ensuing political crisis sparked a wave of large-scale demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-20-foreign-citizens-to-be-deported-from-georgia-for-participating-in-mass-protests/	2025-01-04T07:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg
Russia strikes residential building in Sumy Oblast, injuring at least 3, including children	Russia struck a multi-story residential building in the Svesa village in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 4, injuring at least three people, including two children, the local military administration reported. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day. Russian forces carried out the recent strike using a glide bomb that was dropped directly on the building and destroyed one of its blocks. People may be under the rubble. Emergency services are conducting search and rescue operations at the scene, the administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-strike-residential-building-with-glide-bomb-in-sumy-oblast-injuring-at-least-3-people-including-children/	2025-01-04T06:47:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-04-16_09_19.jpeg
Transnistria urges residents to heat stoves with wood amid significant gas shortages	Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of the Russia-led breakaway Transnistria region in Moldova, urged residents on Jan. 3 to heat their stoves with wood whenever possible amid gas shortages. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The suspension triggered an energy crisis in Transnistria, which now faces industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. Authorities in Transnistria also rejected earlier Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas via European platforms. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are currently without heating and hot water, and nearly 72,000 homes are without gas, according to Krasnoselsky. Krasnoselsky added that 150 gas boiler houses have been disconnected, while two large social facilities have been switched to diesel heating. &quot;The almost complete gasification of the (region) is one of the reasons for well-deserved pride: we strived for 100% coverage of the population with this benefit of civilization. But today, we remember with gratitude those who built housing with stove heating,&quot; he said. &quot;Fortunately, our region is rich in wood. We still have stocks. Solid fuel sales points have been opened in every district. At the request of citizens who cannot provide themselves with firewood due to life circumstances, it is delivered free of charge,&quot; Krasnoselsky said, adding that &quot;there are no hopeless situations.&quot; Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-installed-government-of-transnistria-urges-residents-to-heat-stoves-with-wood-amid-significant-gas-shortages/	2025-01-04T06:43:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Internally displaced Ukrainians’ struggle to survive takes some back to Russian occupation	Last winter as Olena Morozova braced for a long and arduous trip to Ukrainian-controlled territory from her Russian-occupied home in Lysychansk in Luhansk Oblast, her friends were traveling in the opposite direction. The friends &#x2014; a family with two sons &#x2014; came back to their house in Lysychansk because they couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay the rent in Dnipro, the regional capital in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which hosts the largest number of internally displaced people in Ukraine, Morozova told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;They told me it was very difficult (to live) in Ukrainian-controlled territory, too,&#x201D; Morozova said, &#x201C;But I didn&#x2019;t even want to listen, because we were set to leave (Lysychansk) after the New Year.&#x201D; After nearly three years of all-out war, some internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine are opting to return to Russian-occupied areas due to the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s failure to provide them with proper housing and enough financial aid to adequately resettle. An estimated one-third of the Ukrainian population, or nearly 14 million people, left their homes in 2022 following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Many have returned since, but at least 3.5 million remain internally displaced at the moment, according to the UN. Official data on how many people have returned to Russian occupation is difficult to obtain. The Social Policy Ministry recorded 1,262 displaced persons returning to occupied territories over the last nine months, the Ombudsman Office told the Kyiv Independent but noted the number could be higher, citing limited access to the data. Some estimate the number is much higher. Luhansk-born Ukrainian lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko from the ruling Servant of the People party recently said that 150,000 people had left Ukrainian-controlled territories to return to Russian occupation.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)After his comment was widely published in the media and a top Ukrainian official accused him of lying &#x201C;for the hype,&#x201D; Tkachenko retracted his statement, adding that it was his &#x201C;unfounded and emotional assumption.&#x201D; Nonetheless, other officials commented on the failed state policy for the displaced, without citing their numbers. At the outset of the war, Ukraine&#x2019;s government responded to the influx of displaced persons by announcing financial assistance, compensation for employers who gave work to IDPs, and partial or full subsidies on the cost of living, according to the Ombudsman&#x2019;s Office. It has also ordered local administrations to provide them with free housing, which has proved difficult to get and often inadequate to people&#x2019;s needs. Stories of some families show that a lack of enough government assistance may be forcing some to make the decision to return home, even if it means life under Russian occupation, where basic services are lacking and people live under the threat of prosecution for their Ukrainian identity. &#x201C;Now (my friends) are crying and want to return (to Ukraine),&#x201D; said Morozova, 48, whose family is happy with their choice to move to Kyiv despite their struggle to make ends meet without any state support. Many IDPs live on the brink of poverty, with 40% relying on humanitarian assistance from the state and international humanitarian organizations to meet their basic needs, according to a UN November 2024 survey. Their struggles only got worse in March 2024 after the government revised its regulations on financial aid towards living expenses for the internally displaced &#x2014; set around $45 per month for adults and $70 for children and people with disabilities. The allowance is far less than the actual subsistence minimum, last estimated by the Social Policy Ministry in 2022 at around $145 and projected to be much higher now. Per the new decree, the number of people receiving the payments dropped more than twice &#x2013; from 2.5 million in 2023 to over 1 million in August 2024, according to the Social Policy Ministry. The payments will be revised every six months, cutting off more people as the government aims to primarily help those with the lowest income.

(Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)But for many displaced people, this aid is &#x201C;not just partial assistance in paying for housing, but in fact one of the few means of subsistence,&#x201D; the Ombudsman&#x2019;s Office told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;We rented whatever was available,&#x201D; said Antonina Palamarchuk, 64, who fled Myrnohrad, Donetsk Oblast, and moved around Ukraine until settling in Kyiv with her daughter. The cost of their apartment &#x2014; Hr 12,000 or $280 &#x2014; exceeds Antonina&#x2019;s pension, which is just $2 more than the legislated minimum that would have allowed her to receive financial aid from the state. She told the Kyiv Independent that a relative decided to go live with family in Donetsk, occupied by Russia since 2014, because she had nowhere to live in Ukraine-controlled territory. Even as the government has claimed to provide free housing for the displaced, many wait months to be housed. Activists say that the reason behind the long wait times is not the lack of available lodgings, but their inadequate management at the local and national level. &#x201C;There is certainly little help from the state in the form of housing,&#x201D; said lawmaker Tkachenko, who also co-founded a nonprofit &#x201C;VPO Ukrainy&#x201D; that helps displaced people. As of July 1, only 2,995 internally displaced people in the country were living in the temporary municipal lodgings, and 13,048 were on the waiting list, the Infrastructure Development Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Tkachenko said that conditions in government-provided housing are often inadequate &#x2014; such as &#x201C;one shower used by 50 women and children&#x201D; &#x2014; while people are often forced to pay for utility services themselves.

(Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP via Getty Images)Though the state offers to cover these expenses for the local administrations, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;easier for some managers of these facilities to collect money directly from displaced people&#x201D; rather than wait to be reimbursed by the state, a process that can be long and bureaucratic, Tkachenko told the Kyiv Independent. His account corresponds with a recent UN survey from October 2024, which said that 23% of IDPs reported lacking adequate accommodation, compared to only 6% of the non-displaced. &#x201C;We&apos;re talking about the minimum necessities of life,&#x201D; Tkachenko said. A 2022 decree mandated that local governments finance and build shelters or provide municipal buildings for the displaced. While local communities helped lots of internally displaced people in 2022, they have since run into trouble finding the resources to accommodate everyone as the war stretches into its third year, said Petro Andriushchenko, ex-advisor to the mayor of Russian-occupied Mariupol. Meanwhile, habitable state-owned facilities sit empty. According to Andriushchenko, the Education Ministry never placed any IDPs in university dorms, even though they have remained vacant as students study remotely due to the war. &#x201C;(Local) communities ask a logical question: Why should we give away our building (to the displaced) if there is an empty state building?&#x201D; he said. He added that international organizations are ready to finance reconstructions of the living quarters for the displaced, so the government&#x2019;s passive approach had little to do with the lack of funds. &#x201C;People on the top just don&#x2019;t want to make uncomfortable managerial decisions,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s about their inability to put things in order in state-owned real estate that is empty or repurpose it.&#x201D; Karyna, 10, who was evacuated from the Kherson region, sits on a bed in a room where she lives with her parents and sister at a refugee reception center in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 28, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Another reason for what Andriushchenko described as the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;non-existent policy&#x201D; towards the displaced citizens could be Ukraine&#x2019;s strong civil society. Since the onset of the full-scale war, countless volunteers, individuals, and organizations have mobilized to help their fellow citizens. &#x201C;Volunteers picked us up (after we crossed the border),&#x201D; Morozova said, describing her family&#x2019;s trip from Russia&apos;s border to the nearest city Sumy in the north of Ukraine last winter. Volunteers also helped them find the first place to stay in a village near Kyiv, and later &#x2014; a single-room apartment that Morozova now rents with her husband and son. &#x201C;The flat is really broken, but at least the roof doesn&#x2019;t leak and there are no drafts,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We lived in the cold for two years (in occupation).&#x201D; Amid higher unemployment, diminishing government support, and harsh living conditions as Russia bombards Ukrainian energy infrastructure, some people turn to their last resort: going back home to Russian occupation. The trip back itself can be treacherous. There are no border crossings between Ukrainian-controlled and Russia-held territories in Ukraine and the only remaining border crossing at the two countries&#x2019; borders is for entrance back into Ukraine only, said Deputy Presidential Office head Iryna Vereshchuk during a TV interview on Nov. 27. Vereshchuk blamed the lack of border crossings as the reason why the government is unable to keep official statistics on the number of displaced persons returning to occupation. The only option for Ukrainians to get into Russia is by plane from other countries to Moscow&#x2019;s Sheremetyevo airport, where Russia has set up a &#x201C;filtration&#x201D; facility where they are screened by special services on arrival. This route is long and expensive, with ticket costs starting around $1,000, according to Vereshchuk. &#x201C;Filtration&#x201D; can reportedly last for days, as members of the Russian Security Service question people&#x2019;s allegiance and check their phones. Russian authorities said in October that 83,000 Ukrainians entered the country through Sheremetyevo over the past year, while another 24,000 were turned away.

(Libkos/Getty Images)Based on Andriushchenko&#x2019;s communications with people who tried going through the airport and the data he claims to get from sources in occupied Mariupol, he and other activists estimate the number of Ukrainians turned away on arrival to be much higher &#x2014; roughly 200,000 or more. The number of those who went in could be as high as 150,000. &#x201C;They just go wherever they have a place to live,&#x201D; Andriushchenko said. &#x201C;Because here they simply have nothing to spend or nothing to pay for food.&#x201D; Others return home to look after ailing relatives. According to Olha, a 67-year-old Zaporizhzhia native currently living in Kyiv whose name has been changed for security reasons, one of her friends returned to occupation in September to look after her bed-ridden husband, despite being detained and held captive by Russians early into the full-scale invasion. Olha hasn&apos;t heard from her friend since. While Russian propaganda uses the numbers of returning Ukrainians to claim that life under occupation is better than in Ukrainian-controlled territories, international media reports and stories told by Ukrainians in Russian-controlled areas paint a different picture. In Lysychansk, Morozova told the Kyiv Independent she didn&#x2019;t see fresh bread for half a year after its occupation in July 2022. She survived by selling fire-cooked dumplings, while her husband made little money by delivering drinking water to the elderly neighbors who had some retirement savings. After weathering two years without utilities except for gas, Morozova fell severely sick and couldn&#x2019;t get out of bed. There was no medical assistance available in the city. The Russian soldiers which her family asked for help said that they &#x201D;have nothing to do with civilians.&#x201D; A neighbor took her to the hospital in Luhansk, occupied since 2014, where she received some medical help. &#x201C;They injected me with Ukrainian drugs. Expired, though,&#x201D; Morozova added. When she spoke in October with her friends who returned to occupied Lysychansk last winter, they told her that little had changed: There was no water supply or central heating and electricity was unstable.

There are a lot of mice in apartments because there are a lot of empty apartments &#x2014; many people have moved out.&#x201D; Their story reflects some of the dire conditions Ukrainians face under Russia&#x2019;s rule. In addition to prosecution, detention, and murders of pro-Ukrainian activists, they also include enforced Russification. Basic services like schools for children are available only for those with Russian passports. People without Russian IDs can&#x2019;t prove their property rights under a 2023 decree. Starting from July 1, 2024, they can be evicted from their own homes as &#x201C;aliens.&#x201D; According to Andriushchenko, the decree incited a wave of returnees to occupied territories in the past months, as people came home just to make sure their property wasn&apos;t taken away, going back to Ukraine again afterward. But activists say that displaced Ukrainians can&#x2019;t even receive state compensation for damaged property if their homes are in occupation, as financial aid is only given to homeowners in Ukraine-controlled areas. &#x201C;The government treats the displaced like invisible people,&#x201D; said Andriushchenko, who left his post as a mayor&#x2019;s adviser recently.

Russian soldiers near Toretsk disguise as civilians to bypass Ukrainian positions, military says	Russian troops are disguising themselves as civilians to bypass Ukrainian military positions in the Toretsk sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast, commander of the mortar battery of the presidential brigade, call sign &quot;Mozok&quot; (&quot;Brain&quot;), told Suspilne on Jan. 3. The commander&apos;s statement comes after reports on Russian forces starting to move toward the town of Toretsk. Fighting with armored combat vehicles, motorcycles, and buggies took place in the village of Nelipivka, located south of Toretsk, in late December. The soldier, whose name is undisclosed for security reasons, said that after passing Ukrainian positions, Russian soldiers disguised as civilians either wait for reinforcements or use anti-tank mines to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;Some of the soldiers are former prisoners. They are tasked with smuggling anti-tank mines and throwing them into the area of our firing positions when the fighters cannot be knocked out during regular battles. They are trying to blow up buildings where our guys are located,&quot; the soldier told Suspilne. Small infantry groups are also trying to storm and bypass positions under the cover of fog, he added. Toretsk has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-in-toretsk-area-disguise-themselves-as-civilians-bypass-ukrainian-positions-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-04T06:18:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2167352745.jpg
Drones reportedly target one of Russia's largest sea trade ports in Leningrad Oblast	Drones attacked Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaport, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast overnight on Jan. 4, the independent news channel Astra reported. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has been regularly targeting facilities in Russia that fuel its war efforts. Most of the drones that attacked Leningrad Oblast, located over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from the Ukrainian border, were shot down over the terminal of Novotrans, a Russian transportation and logistics company, Astra reported, citing its undisclosed sources. Governor Aleksandr Drozdenko reported that four drones were downed in Leningrad Oblast using electronic warfare and firearms. The attack damaged windows in one of the buildings on the port&apos;s territory, according to preliminary information. There were no casualties, Drozdenko said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Jan. 4 attack on the Russian port in Leningrad Oblast is not the first attack of its kind. On Jan. 24, 2024, Novatek&apos;s gas-condensate plant caught fire at the port of Ust-Luga following a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets deep inside Russian territory. The Ust-Luga Commercial Seaport began operations in December 2001 with the opening of a coal terminal. In the early 2020s, it became one of the largest seaports in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-target-one-of-russias-largest-sea-trade-ports-in-leningrad-oblast/	2025-01-04T04:24:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Russia launches over 300 drones, 20 missiles at Ukraine in first 3 days of new year, Zelensky says	Russia launched more than 300 drones and 20 missiles, including ballistic missiles, at Ukrainian cities and villages over the first three days of the new year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 3. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. Zelensky added that the Russian army also strikes settlements close to the front line with guided aerial bombs every day. &quot;Such Russian terror, which is not decreasing its intensity, requires us and all our partners to continue to build our air shield and all its systemic elements, from patriots to mobile fire groups,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is necessary to replenish the stock of anti-missiles for air defense constantly. We need to increase the capacity of mobile fire groups constantly. I am grateful to all the partners who help us.&quot; The president also announced meetings and talks next week to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense. The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-over-300-drones-20-missiles-at-ukraine-in-first-3-days-of-new-year-zelensky-says/	2025-01-04T02:54:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/drone-strike.jpeg
Slovak state energy company to continue supplying electricity to Ukraine despite Fico's threats	Slovakia&apos;s state-controlled transmission system operator SEPS said it will continue supplying electricity to Ukraine as part of an emergency assistance contract, despite threats from Slovak Prime Minister Roberto Fico, the iRozhlas media outlet reported on Jan. 3. Fico said on Dec. 27 that his government would consider halting electricity supplies to Ukraine after a deal to transit Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine expired on Dec. 31. Kyiv had repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. Due to Russia&apos;s ongoing attacks on the energy system, Ukraine has turned to neighboring countries, including Slovakia, to supply additional electricity from abroad. SEPS will continue to cooperate with the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo under a valid contract extended last spring for another 12 months, the media outlet reported. According to the contract, the Slovak company can supply Ukraine with up to 150 megawatts of electricity for emergency assistance. SEPS has committed to ensuring the cross-border electricity transmission on &quot;standard terms.&quot; SEPS also provides cross-border electricity transmission via high-voltage lines. In the first 11 months of last year, net electricity exports from Slovakia to Ukraine reached 2.43 terawatt-hours, which is three and a half times higher than in the same period in 2023, according to iRozhlas. Slovakia&apos;s former Economy Minister Karel Hirman said previously that electricity is sold to Ukraine by traders, not the state, iRozhlas reported. Hirman added that Slovakia would be drawn into a conflict within the European Union if the electricity supply to Ukraine was stopped. Apart from threats to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine, Fico also said Slovakia could reduce aid for Ukrainian refugees in response to Ukraine&apos;s decision to terminate Russian gas transit. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war. Fico also has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with a friendly attitude toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-state-energy-company-to-continue-to-supply-electricity-to-ukraine-despite-ficos-threats/	2025-01-04T02:49:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Woman injured in Russian Jan. 3 attack on Kyiv Oblast dies in hospital	A woman injured by falling drone debris during a Russian attack on Kyiv Oblast on Jan. 3 died in the hospital, the Kyiv Military Administration reported on Jan. 4. Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Kyiv Oblast early in the morning on Jan. 3. The attack killed one person and injured four others, including a 16-year-old teenager. The woman, who died in the hospital the day after the strike, had a severe abdominal wound. &quot;Doctors fought for her life for almost a day until the last minute,&quot; the statement read. According to the local military administration, another victim of the Russian Jan. 3 attack is in intensive care with a back injury. A young man with a knee injury is also under medical supervision but is not in critical condition. Russia also launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people and injuring six others, including two pregnant women.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 4. Russian forces launched 81 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 34 drones in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Odesa, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Forty-seven drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Russian forces launched three Iskander-M ballistic missiles at Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 3, killing a 72-year-old man and injuring four people, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. The attack destroyed two houses and damaged the other 10. Russia struck the village of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Jan. 3 with Grad multiple rocket launchers, killing a man, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The man&apos;s wife was hospitalized with injuries. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 40 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, eight people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces also launched a drone attack at the village of Antonivka in Kherson Oblast on the morning of Jan. 4, injuring a 71-year-old man. He was hospitalized with mine-blast trauma and shrapnel wounds to the head and abdomen, according to the local military administration. In Donetsk Oblast, four people were injured in the city of Sloviansk, and one person suffered injuries in the village of Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka due to the Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Jan. 4.

This number includes 1,510 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,679 tanks, 20,093 armored fighting vehicles, 32,843 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,578 artillery systems, 1,257 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,356 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-793-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2025-01-03T23:13:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188757384.jpg
Lukashenko to visit China ahead of Belarus presidential elections	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko will visit China this month ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation reported on Jan. 3. With Belarus isolated from the West due to Lukashenko&apos;s repressive regime and continued support for Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, Lukashenko has found China to be a key ally. In August the two nations pledged to strengthen security ties and improve cooperation. Lukashenko is looking to improve mutual cooperation between Belarus and China in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, mechanical engineering, and the defense industry, the Center for Countering Disinformation reported. Lukashenko is likely looking to reduce Belarusian dependence on Russia and strengthen his hand in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Center said. Belarus is under pressure from Russia due to economic and energy dependency, debt from Russian loans, and Moscow&apos;s military presence in Belarus. Lukashenko is also likely angling for China to mediate a reopening of trade routes from Belarus to the EU, according to the Center. The trip will mark Lukashenko&apos;s third visit to China in three years. Lukashenko has been in power for 30 years and is seeking a seventh term on Jan. 26. The Belarusian presidential elections are not expected to be free or fair. When Belarus last held elections in 2020, mass protests broke out and the West condemned the election results as fraudulent. Lukashenko&apos;s regime quelled the protests in a large-scale crackdown on dissent.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-to-visit-china-ahead-of-belarus-presidential-elections/	2025-01-03T19:55:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1798852424.jpg
Finnish court upholds seizure of Russian tanker suspected of cable sabotage	The Helsinki District Court ruled on Jan. 3 to uphold Finland&apos;s seizure of the Russian Eagle S oil tanker, denying an appeal to release the ship and its crew. Finnish authorities allege the ship damaged a crucial undersea power cable, possibly in an act of sabotage. Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) cable connecting Estonia and Finland, was seriously damaged on Dec. 25. The Eagle S belongs to Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers Moscow uses to circumvent sanctions, including a Group of Seven (G7) price cap on Russian oil. The Helsinki District Court has ruled to keep the tanker under seizure, the Finnish news outlet Yle reported. Finnish police initially seized the tanker on Dec. 28, considering the vessel to be evidence in a criminal investigation. Caravella LLC FZ, the ship&apos;s United Arab Emirates-based owner, applied to the court to have the seizure lifted. Police requested the trial be held in secret and court documents kept confidential. Finnish investigators are currently interrogating Eagle S crew members about the alleged incident. Authorities expect the initial phase of the investigation to last several weeks, and for the entire investigation to conclude in several months. Three Finnish companies are also demanding the seizure of the tanker in order to secure compensation for damage to the cable. These include national grid operator Fingrid, telecommunications firm Elisa, and state-owned network company Cinia. Following the cable incident, NATO pledged to enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea. Finland joined the military alliance in early 2o23 in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-court-continues-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-over-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-03T18:31:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
EU chief von der Leyen ill with 'severe' pneumonia, cancels engagements	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has canceled upcoming engagements due to a case of pneumonia, Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said on Jan. 3. Von der Leyen, 66, has led the executive body of the European Union since 2019. She has positioned herself as a staunch supporter of Ukraine throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;The president has canceled her external engagements for the first two weeks of January. She is dealing with a severe pneumonia,&quot; de Keersmaecker said. &quot;The canceled appointments include a speech in Lisbon and the scheduled trip to Gdansk on the occasion of the launch of the Polish Council presidency, which will take place at a later stage.&quot; The spokesperson did not provide any further details on von der Leyen&apos;s condition. Poland on Jan. 1 took over the rotating presidency of the EU Council, replacing Hungary in the role. An event launching the Polish presidency was held in Warsaw on Jan. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-chief-von-der-leyen-ill-with-severe-pneumonia-cancels-engagements/	2025-01-03T17:33:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1662120631.jpeg
Moldova faces 'security crisis' after Russian gas shut-off, PM Recean says	Russia&apos;s decision to cut off gas supplies to Moldova has thrown the country into a &quot;security crisis,&quot; Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said on Jan. 3. The Russian state energy company Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, triggering an energy emergency in the Russian-occupied breakaway region of Transnistria. The region now risks industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. &quot;By jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has backed for three decades in an effort to destabilize Moldova, Russia is revealing the inevitable outcome for all its allies &#x2014; betrayal and isolation,&quot; Recean said in a statement. &quot;We treat this as a security crisis aimed at enabling the return of pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova and weaponizing our territory against Ukraine, with whom we share a 1,200-km border.&quot; Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova switched to European energy supplies after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the region remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. Gazprom&apos;s suspension has left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply, according to Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration. Transnistria has initiated rolling blackouts to mitigate the crisis. While Moldova offered to assist Transnistria in purchasing alternatives to Russian gas via the European market, authorities in the region refused, saying they believed Gazprom would resume deliveries. Gazprom has said that the decision to cut off gas to Moldova resulted from outstanding debts, an allegation Chisinau disputes. A deal allowing Russian gas to transit to Europe through Ukraine also expired on Jan. 1, but Gazprom did not cite transit issues as the reason for the suspension. Moldova could still receive Russian gas supplies via alternative routes. Chisinau has repeatedly accused Moscow of attemping to destabilize the country in order to bring Moldova under Russian control.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-faces-security-crisis-after-russian-gas-shut-off-pm-recean-says/	2025-01-03T16:20:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2173939066.jpg
China may have stopped Putin from using nuclear weapons, Blinken says	China may have talked Russian President Vladimir Putin out of deploying nuclear weapons amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with the Financial Times (FT) on Jan. 3. Beijing has emerged as Moscow&apos;s leading ally and financial backer since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, though China has denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. China may have exerted its influence over Russia to intervene when Putin was considering nuclear escalation, Blinken told the FT. &quot;We have reason to believe that China engaged Russia and said: &apos;Don&apos;t go there,&apos;&quot; he said. Blinken said the U.S. had been &quot;very concerned&quot; because Putin appeared to be considering nuclear weapons. &quot;Even if the probability went from 5 to 15%, when it comes to nuclear weapons, nothing is more serious,&quot; he said. Blinken also claimed that China may have intervened in a similar manner after the U.S. warned Beijing that Putin was planning to launch a nuclear weapon into space. Fear of escalating hostilities with nuclear-armed Russia has been a driving factor behind the current U.S. administration&apos;s policy toward Ukraine. Under President Joe Biden, the White House delayed deliveries of certain weapons and withheld permission for Kyiv to launch deep strikes within Russian territory, citing Putin&apos;s &quot;red lines.&quot; Putin began a new round of nuclear saber-rattling in late November after Biden allowed Ukraine to attack some Russian targets with U.S.-made long-range weapons. Putin revised Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine, expanding the criteria under which the country can launch a nuclear strike. Despite these steps, U.S. intelligence sources have said that the risk of a Russian nuclear strike has not increased and remains unlikely. Blinken defended Biden&apos;s record on Russia and Ukraine, saying that Putin suffered a &quot;strategic defeat&quot; and that NATO has grown stronger. Biden&apos;s term ends later this month when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Republican Senator Marco Rubio will replace Blinken as secretary of state.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-may-have-stopped-putin-from-using-nuclear-weapons-blinken-says/	2025-01-03T15:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
Transnistria rejects offer to buy gas from Europe, expects Russia to resume supplies	The Russian-occupied Transnistria region of Moldova has rejected Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas via European platforms, Vadim Cheban, head of the state energy company Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 3. Transnistria instead expects Russia&apos;s Gazprom will resume deliveries of natural gas, Cheban told the news outlet IPN. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The suspension triggered an energy crisis in Transnistria, which now faces industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. Authorities in Transnistria do not want to purchase gas from the West, claiming this would involve &quot;higher and unstable&quot; energy prices, Cheban said. Moldova had previously offered to assist Transnistria in securing energy resources via European platforms to mitigate the crisis. Transnistrian officials rejected the offer and said they believe Gazprom will resume Russian gas supplies, Cheban reported. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, called the energy crisis in the region &quot;grave,&quot; saying that shortages have left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-rejects-offer-to-buy-gas-from-europe-expects-russia-to-resume-supplies/	2025-01-03T14:06:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1237153625.jpg
We are not Russia' — Thousands protest Fico's pro-Kremlin agenda in Bratislava	Thousands of people gathered in the streets of Bratislava on Jan. 3 to protest Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s pro-Russian policies, the Slovak news outlet Aktuality reported. The demonstrations began less than two weeks after Fico visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and just days after Ukraine stopped the flow of Russian gas to Europe via its territory. Fico lambasted Kyiv for halting gas transit, threatening to cut off energy supplies to Ukraine and end aid to Ukrainian refugees amid the ongoing full-scale war. Approximately 4,000 people assembled in Bratislava to protest Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly stance, Aktuality reported. Demonstrators waved the flags of Slovakia and the European Union, chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot; Protesters played the EU anthem and carried posters labeled &quot;We are Europe.&quot; &quot;Fico, go to Moscow, leave Slovakia in peace,&quot; one banner reportedly read. The Slovak artist Rudolf Sikora, one of the lead speakers at the protest, called on opposition parties to unite with activists and civil associations against the threat of Russian influence. &quot;I beg you, opposition politicians, come together sensibly,&quot; he said. Fico, a pro-Russian populist, won Slovakia&apos;s parliamentary elections in September 2023. It is his fourth time at the helm of the Slovak government. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war. Fico also has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with friendly attitudes toward Putin. Tensions between Bratislava and Kyiv have escalated due to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s decision to allow a pre-war agreement on Russian gas transit via Ukraine to expire without renewal on Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine terminated the transit deal on Jan. 1, after repeatedly warning it would not renew gas transit in order to avoid financing Russia&apos;s war machine. In retaliation, Fico on Jan. 2 threatened to reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees living in Slovakia. He has also threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-are-not-russia-thousands-protest-ficos-pro-kremlin-agenda-in-bratislava/	2025-01-03T12:59:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190596481.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian envoy dismisses Trump’s reported peace deal; Over 50,000 Russians seek soldiers MIA	Key developments on Jan. 3: More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking missing soldiers through Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said in an interview with ArmyInform on Jan. 3. &quot;These numbers only reflect those unafraid to contact us,&quot; Okhrimenko said, adding that there actual number of Russian soldiers missing in action can be much higher. Initially part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline &#x2014; launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) to help Russian soldiers surrender &#x2014; the separate &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project was created to handle inquiries from Russian families about missing soldiers. Okhrimenko criticized Russia&#x2019;s lack of effort in recovering or identifying the missing, saying, &quot;Many remain scattered in Ukrainian fields, their remains carried by stray animals. Russia shows no interest in identifying them.&quot; Earlier, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives seeking information about missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that relatives&apos; DNA data had been collected and stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of troops missing in action. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, warned against publicizing such figures, saying, &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3 that Russia has lost 793,250 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has not presented anything &quot;interesting&quot; to Moscow regarding ending the war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said on Jan. 3. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Nebenzya dismissed these ideas as &quot;unformed, vague signals&quot; and reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s position against freezing the conflict. &quot;President (Vladimir) Putin last outlined our conditions for ending the conflict on Dec. 19. So far, nothing from the incoming U.S. administration suggests anything of interest to us,&quot; Nebenzya said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands. Despite Trump&#x2019;s claims of achieving peace &quot;within 24 hours,&quot; his team has yet to provide an official roadmap for ending the war. Germany should not rule out deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine after the war ends, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3. Kiesewetter&apos;s remarks come amid reports that the U.K. and France are considering sending troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Proposals for European states to deploy millitry personnel to Ukraine are reportedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s peace plan. Kiesewetter argued that as Europe&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has a responsibility to contribute significantly to European security and peacekeeping efforts. He said that Germany must be ready to intervene in Ukraine &quot;at the appropriate time with well-equipped troops&quot; and warned against dismissing such a possibility. Kiesewetter noted that any German peacekeeping involvement would need to occur under joint EU and NATO frameworks to ensure operational effectiveness and align with existing European security structures. &quot;A peacekeeping force is effective and realistic if integrated into NATO, as the nuclear umbrella would extend to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&#x2019;s consent. Ukraine will not hold elections under martial law even if Russia puts it forward as one of the pre-conditions for negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution. In the interview, Zelensky reiterated that presidential and parliamentary elections are not possible under martial law and that the elected officials continue to legally perform their duties until the next vote. After Ukraine manages to end the hot stage of the war, maintains a strong army, and secures powerful security guarantees, martial law can be lifted, and the parliament can set a date for the elections, the president said. &quot;After martial law ends, there is no need to wait years for the elections,&quot; Zelensky added. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority in the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, the bureau confirmed to Suspilne on Jan. 2. The statement comes following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv princess and spouse to French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. France fulfilled its obligations regarding training and arms, said Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net outlet, in the media investigation, putting the blame for the unit&apos;s problems on top Ukrainian military and political leadership. According to the journalist, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Around 38% of Ukrainians are open to conceding some of the territories while preserving independence in order to end the war with Russia as fast as possible, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey published on Jan. 3. The poll comes amid growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The responses, collected between Dec. 2 and 17, 2024, show a moderate increase since October, when 32% of the respondents were willing to compromise on territorial integrity for a faster peace deal. Only 19% agreed with the statement in December 2023 and 8% in December 2022, making the December 2024 figures the highest since the KIIS began the measurements in May 2022. The all-out war, which will mark its third anniversary in less than two months, has put a massive strain on the Ukrainian state, society, and the military, while the Russian offensive has picked up pace in recent months. Comparatively, 51% of respondents in December 2024 said that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories &quot;under no circumstances... even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence.&quot; This is a drop from 58% in October 2024, 74% in December 2023, and 85% in December 2022. The question did not specify which territories could be given up nor whether they should be officially recognized as Russian territory or &quot;merely&quot; remain temporarily under Russian occupation. The survey involved 2,000 respondents across Ukraine-controlled territories who were interviewed via phone.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-over-50-000-russians-seek-mia-through-ukraines-project/	2025-01-03T12:13:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Nothing of interest' — Russian envoy dismisses Trump’s reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has not presented anything &quot;interesting&quot; to Moscow regarding ending the war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said on Jan. 3 in an interview with the state-controlled Rossiya-1 TV channel. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.

So far, nothing from the incoming U.S. administration suggests anything of interest to us,&quot; Nebenzya said. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with Trump but upheld Moscow&#x2019;s demands, including the desire to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson &#x2014; and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Nebenzya also claimed to have received &quot;signals of agreements&quot; from Ukraine, though he rejected them as unserious. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands.

Ukraine hits $24.5 billion in agro-exports, nearing pre-war levels, Agriculture Ministry reports	Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports reached $24.5 billion in 2024, accounting for 59% of the country&#x2019;s total exports, the Agriculture Ministry reported on Jan. 3. This marks a significant recovery, nearing pre-war levels and achieving the second-highest record after 2021&#x2019;s $27.7 billion. Ukraine, a global agricultural powerhouse, exported 78.3 million tons of products in 2024, including grains and sunflower seeds critical to markets across Africa and Asia. Sunflower oil led the exports at 21%, with nearly 6 million tons worth $5.1 billion. Corn matched this share, with 29.6 million tons exported for $5 billion. Wheat followed at 15%, totaling 20.6 million tons worth $3.7 billion. Other notable exports included rapeseed (7%, $1.8 billion), soybeans (5%, $1.3 billion), and oilcake and residues (4%, $1 billion). Meat and poultry products accounted for 4% ($958 million), while barley and sugar each made up 2% of exports at $557 million and $418 million, respectively. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, Moscow has sought to obstruct Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural exports, blockading the Black Sea and attempting to replace Ukrainian products in global markets with its own, including grain looted from occupied territories. Despite these challenges, Ukraine reopened a maritime trade corridor in 2023, enabling the revival of its agricultural exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-24-5-billion-in-agro-exports-nearing-pre-war-levels-agriculture-ministry-reported/	2025-01-03T11:10:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1242186203.jpg
Ukrainian Navy ensures safe passage for over 9,000 vessels through sea corridor in 2024, Navy Commander says	The Ukrainian Navy facilitated the safe passage of 9,061 civilian vessels through its sea corridor in 2024, Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said on Jan. 3. Following Russia&apos;s termination of the grain deal in July 2023, Ukraine opened a new corridor in August, initially aimed at evacuating ships stranded since the start of the full-scale war. It has since evolved into a critical trade route. Neizhpapa said that 4,651 vessels arrived in Ukraine, while 4,410 departed for other ports, enabling the export of over 74.4 million tons of cargo, including agricultural products. &quot;This is vital for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and global food security, as nearly 80% of goods are transported by sea,&quot; he said. Navigating the route remains dangerous due to persistent threats of Russian attacks and drifting mines. Neizhpapa credited the Navy&#x2019;s continuous efforts, including destroying numerous mines and escorting cargo ships, for maintaining safety. &quot;Not a single sea mine explosion occurred in ports, thanks to our personnel and divers,&quot; he said. Ukraine&#x2019;s maritime trade route has been targeted by Russia, including a Sept. 12 missile attack on a cargo ship carrying Ukrainian wheat to Egypt. The vessel was hit while sailing in Romania&#x2019;s exclusive economic zone, 55 kilometers from the Romanian port of Sfantu Gheorghe, according to Romania&apos;s Coast Guard. The Ukrainian Navy continues its efforts to ensure safe navigation and uphold Ukraine&#x2019;s position in the global maritime market.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-navy-ensures-safe-passage-for-over-9-000-vessels-through-sea-corridor-in-2024-navy-commander-says/	2025-01-03T10:26:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1839572541.jpg
Russian missile attack on Chernihiv kills 1, injures 4	Russia launched a ballistic missile attack on Chernihiv on Jan. 3, killing one person and injuring four others, Chernihiv Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Chaus said. The attack targeted a residential area on the outskirts of Chernihiv, causing significant damage to multiple apartment buildings, Chaus said. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force had warned of the incoming ballistic attack earlier in the day. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. Chernihiv Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia, was partially occupied during the early stages of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Although Russian forces withdrew from the region in April 2022, Chernihiv remains under near-daily attack due to its proximity to the border.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-chernihiv-kills-1-injures-4/	2025-01-03T09:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-03_17-45-25.jpg
Rolling blackouts begin in Russian-occupied Transnistria amid gas shortages, local authorties say	Authorities in Russian-occupied Transnistria began rolling blackouts on Jan. 3 after Russia&#x2019;s suspension of gas exports caused emergency power outages, the so-called economic development ministry announced. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials dispute the claim, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine also expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. The blackouts, aimed at reducing energy consumption, will last an hour in the evenings across main cities &#x2014; Tiraspol, Rybnitsa, and Bender &#x2014; and several villages. Transnistria, home to approximately 370,000 residents, has been heavily affected, with widespread heating outages reported. In January, the average temperature in Transnistria can drop to -5 &#xB0;C (24&#xB0;F) at night. Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, called the crisis &quot;grave,&quot; saying that shortages have left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply. Prolonged disruptions could cause &quot;irreversible damage&quot; to the region&#x2019;s industrial capacity, he warned. Moldova has offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms. Vadim Cheban, head of Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 2 that Chisinau is ready to assist Transnistrian authorities in securing energy resources on market terms to mitigate the crisis. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s.	https://kyivindependent.com/rolling-blackouts-begin-in-russian-occupied-transnistria-amid-gas-shortages-ministry-says/	2025-01-03T08:57:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Over 50,000 Russians seek MIA through Ukraine’s project, representative says	More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking missing soldiers through Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said in an interview with ArmyInform on Jan. 3. &quot;These numbers only reflect those unafraid to contact us,&quot; Okhrimenko said, adding that there actual number of Russian soldiers missing in action can be much higher. Initially part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline &#x2014; launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) to help Russian soldiers surrender &#x2014; the separate &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project was created to handle inquiries from Russian families about missing soldiers. Okhrimenko criticized Russia&#x2019;s lack of effort in recovering or identifying the missing, saying, &quot;Many remain scattered in Ukrainian fields, their remains carried by stray animals. Russia shows no interest in identifying them.&quot; Earlier, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives seeking information about missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that relatives&apos; DNA data had been collected and stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of troops missing in action. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, warned against publicizing such figures, saying, &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3 that Russia has lost 793,250 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-000-russians-seek-missing-soldiers-through-ukraines-project/	2025-01-03T08:07:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Germany should not rule out peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, CDU lawmaker says	Germany should not rule out deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine after the war ends, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3, Schw&#xE4;bische Zeitung reported. Kiesewetter&apos;s remarks come amid reports that the U.K. and France are considering sending troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Proposals for European states to deploy millitry personnel to Ukraine are reportedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s peace plan. Kiesewetter argued that as Europe&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has a responsibility to contribute significantly to European security and peacekeeping efforts. He said that Germany must be ready to intervene in Ukraine &quot;at the appropriate time with well-equipped troops&quot; and warned against dismissing such a possibility. Kiesewetter noted that any German peacekeeping involvement would need to occur under joint EU and NATO frameworks to ensure operational effectiveness and align with existing European security structures. &quot;A peacekeeping force is effective and realistic if integrated into NATO, as the nuclear umbrella would extend to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&#x2019;s consent. Merz underscored the necessity of a clear international legal mandate for German participation in such operations. During a Dec. 9 visit to Kyiv, Merz pledged a more assertive stance on arming Ukraine and highlighted Germany&#x2019;s potential role in peacekeeping. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Ukrainian officials maintain that NATO membership is essential for lasting peace. While full membership is unlikely amid the ongoing war, Kyiv has urged NATO allies to extend an invitation as a signal of support.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-should-not-rule-out-peacekeeping-mission-in-ukraine-cdu-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-03T07:30:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169569133.jpg
Polish farmers protest in Warsaw against Ukrainian imports, EU policies	Polish farmers launched a protest in Warsaw on Jan. 3 against agricultural imports from Ukraine and the EU policies they claim are threatening their livelihoods, the RMF24 news outlet reported. The protest follows a series of demonstrations by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports after the EU lifted tariffs on goods from Ukraine in 2022. The most recent rally, which coincides with the inauguration of the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU, is held under the slogan &quot;Five times STOP.&quot; The five issues that sparked the protest include Ukrainian imports, the European bloc&apos;s trade deal with the Mercosur group of South American countries, the Green Deal, the EU policies on forests and hunting, and the perceived &quot;extinction of the Polish economy.&quot; The protests began at 2 p.m. local time in front of the European Commission representation building on Jasna Street. Approximately two hours later, the farmers will hold a march through the city and conclude the event at 11 p.m. &quot;All agricultural organizations in our country will protest against the harmful policies of the European Union, against (European Commission President) Ursula von der Leyen, who is imposing policies that will force closure of our farms,&quot; said Tomasz Obszanski, chairman of the Independent Farmers&apos; Trade Union Solidarnosc (Solidarity). Polish farmers and truckers launched their largest protests in late 2023 and early 2024, blocking off cargo traffic at the Polish-Ukrainian border. Most recently, on Nov. 23, farmers staged a blockade at the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, which lasted just over a day and restricted truck traffic. Warsaw has already implemented import bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture. The Polish government has expressed support for farmers&#x2019; concerns, highlighting challenges posed by the EU&#x2019;s trade policies while also seeking to maintain solidarity with Ukraine during the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-protest-in-warsaw-against-ukrainian-imports-eu-policies/	2025-01-03T06:01:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1949617243.jpg
Ukraine aims to raise over $1 billion for 'Danish model' of defense industry funding in 2025	Ukraine is planning to raise more than $1 billion in 2025 to develop the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 3. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Shmyhal also said that Ukraine aims to expand its domestic defense production capacity to $30 billion next year. &quot;The Danish model of cooperation is not only solidarity but also determination to support our struggle for freedom and sovereignty,&quot; said Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov. Last year, Ukraine produced 18 domestically-developed Bohdana self-propelled howitzers financed by Copenhagen. Kyiv has so far received over 150 million euros ($156 million) in funding from Denmark, France, and Lithuania to bolster its defense industry, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in late December.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aims-to-raise-over-1-billion-for-danish-model-in-2025/	2025-01-03T05:56:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 159	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 159 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Dec. 15-22, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Updated IMF Memorandum. On Dec. 20, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published an updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) following its sixth review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment related to state-owned banks is as follows: As we reported in Issue 116, foreign investors had shown interest in acquiring Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. There are also several commitments related to SOEs that were not included as structural benchmarks: Energoatom&#x2019;s new supervisory board has not been operational for five months. In a comment to European Pravda on Dec. 16, Katarina Mathernova, EU Ambassador to Ukraine, emphasized the need to launch the full-fledged work of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board, which was formally established in June 2024. &#x201C;I want to emphasize that we are very interested in the formation of the supervisory board of Energoatom. As G7, we sent a letter to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal about this last week. The board was selected in June, and now is time to complete the process, sign contracts, and launch the supervisory board. Its view will be an important factor in the decisions on the financing of certain projects,&#x201D; Mathernova noted. On Dec. 18, Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, said that the Cabinet of Ministers was awaiting the independent members of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board, whose first meeting has been open since July 17, to take a position on contracts and to be ready to continue their work. &#x201C;On July 17, the supervisory board opened its first meeting, and it is still open as discussions on contracts continue. On Nov. 26, the Cabinet approved the terms of civil law contracts with Energoatom. Now they are with the independent members, and we are awaiting their position on whether they are prepared to sign them and continue working,&#x201D; Sobolev added. He also noted that the supervisory board members should elect a board chair at their first meeting. This is the first time that contracts have remained unsigned for such an extended period, he also added. &#x201C;The Cabinet put forward its own proposals, and board members made suggestions that occasionally contradicted the law. We tried to moderate and form a position that allowed us to make a decision on Nov. 26 and approve the contracts. I hope they will sign them now. I cannot disclose the details of the contracts as they are classified as documents for internal use only,&#x201D; Sobolev noted. When asked about the remuneration levels, Sobolev said they were in line with remunerations at other energy SOEs in Ukraine, such as Ukrenergo or Naftogaz, adding that the conditions for all board members (of Energoatom) were the same. The Cabinet approved the terms of the contracts with the independent and state-appointed members of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board on Nov. 26. As we wrote in Issue 137, the Cabinet of Ministers approved all five board members on June 21: Timothy John Stone, Michael Elliott Kirst, and Jarek Neverovych as independent members, and Vitalii Petruk and Tymofiy Mylovanov, as state representatives nominated by the Energy Ministry. As we reported in September 2024, Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board was supposed to be launched by the end of July 2024, but this had not happened by that time (see our Issue 146). Forbes Ukraine then wrote that only Ukrainian members of the board had signed the contracts, while foreign independent members believed that the first meeting could only be held after the contracts were signed. In order not to violate the law, the first meeting was started within 30 days after board appointment, but the board had not made any decisions and could not complete the meeting, the media then wrote. During the Verkhovna Rada&#x2019;s meeting on Sept 6, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board had met &#x2014; the board meeting was opened. According to Halushchenko, contracts were being finalized, and the supervisory board was competent. See Issue 146 for more detail. Fitch affirms Naftogaz&#x2019;s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at &#x2018;CC.&apos; The company&#x2019;s senior unsecured notes issued by Kondor Finance plc have been affirmed at &#x2018;C.&apos; The Recovery Rating is &#x2018;RR6.&apos; Naftogaz&#x2019;s Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) remains at &#x2018;cc.&apos; According to Fitch, Naftogaz&#x2019;s &#x2018;CC&#x2019; IDR reflects the company&#x2019;s projected weak liquidity, due to very high operational risks in Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia, slow payments for gas, and limited external funding options. The agency said the key rating drivers included: On July 26, 2022, Naftogaz defaulted on its Eurobonds maturing in July 2022 and November 2026 due to the Cabinet of Ministers&#x2019; refusal to approve payments on them. See our Issue 68 for more detail. In February 2023, Naftogaz was trying to restructure these Eurobond liabilities with its financial advisor Lazard and legal advisor Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. See Issue 75 for detail. In May 2023, Naftogaz reached agreements with investors on ways to restructure its 2022 and 2026 Eurobonds. The restructuring of both was expected to be completed by the end of July 2023. See Issue 90 for more detail and the restructuring terms. The Cabinet of Ministers as the shareholder of Naftogaz agreed on the term sheet to restructure these Eurobonds on June 24. See Issue 95. In September 2023, Naftogaz reported that it had completed repayments to fulfill its credit obligations after the restructuring of the above Eurobonds. As a result, Naftogaz Group has officially exited default status, the company announced. See Issue 103. In July 2024, Naftogaz said it made timely payments on the restructured Eurobonds. See Issue 141. As we also reported in Issue 68, the government ordered Naftogaz to sell gas at a discount to multiple types of consumers, including households, heating companies, certain thermal power plants, non-household consumers from the defense sector, and regional gas distribution companies. Most of these obligations are linked to the duration of martial law. As we wrote in Issue 77, Naftogaz estimated its net losses in 2022 at Hr 40 billion (1.1 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time). Then CEO Oleksii Chernyshov blamed significant receivables that arose due to the state&#x2019;s use of Naftogaz&#x2019;s working capital to meet the needs of energy consumers. He said that the underlying receivables of the company had three components: the difference in tariffs (Hr 36 billion, or 1.05 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time), the debt of regional gas suppliers and gas distribution companies (Hr 76 billion, or 2.2 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time), and public service obligations (PSOs) for 2022-2023 (Hr 158 billion, or 4.6 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time).&#x202F;See Issue 77 for more detail. As we wrote in December 2023 (Issue 113), Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) wrote that, according to USAID, the total level of unsettled debts in the gas market exceeded Hr 190 billion (4.75 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time) in early September 2023. According to the data of the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC) seen by EP, the total debt exceeded Hr 200 billion (5.1 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time) as of Oct. 1, 202. &#x201C;Our goal is to gradually move to economically justified energy tariffs and cancel all PSOs by the fourth quarter of 2025. This should be done in conjunction with the systematic settlement of debts in the gas and district heating markets,&#x201D; Oleksandr Butenko, then Deputy Minister of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure, then explained. See Issue 113 for more detail. However, Naftogaz has recently kept the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. As before, customers can buy a cubic meter of gas for Hr 7.96 (including VAT). The tariff remains valid through April 30, 2025. See Issue 129 for more detail. Further gas supplies at a reduced tariff will likely result in corresponding losses for Naftogaz, even if heat and power producers pay for gas. Naftogaz Group pays over Hr 80 billion (1.8 billion euros) in taxes in January-November 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on Dec. 17. This includes Hr 74 billion (1.7 billion euros) paid to the state budget and Hr 6 billion (137 million euros) to local government budgets. In November alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 8.1 billion (184.5 million euros) in state taxes, and Hr 500 million (11.4 million euros) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid the following taxes to state and local budgets in the course of 2024: Month&#xA0; Taxes paid to state and local budgets SOE Weekly details UAH Euros* January 6.1 billion 147 million Issue 119 February 5.3 billion 129 million Issue 123 March 8.3 billion 197 million Issue 128 April 8.0 billion 189 million Issue 132 May 9.3 billion 215 million Issue 137 June 9.2 billion 203 million Issue 140 July 6.0 billion 132 million Issue 143 August 7.2 billion 174 million Issue 148 September 5.8 billion 129 million Issue 152 October 5 billion 112 million Naftogaz&#x2019;s release November 8.6 billion 196 million This issue TOTAL 80 billion 1.8 billion This issue * Converted at the NBU&#x2019;s average exchange rate for the respective period. Calculations by SOE Weekly. As we reported in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion (2.1 billion euros) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion (172 million euros) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion (584 million euros) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion (2.3 billion euros) loss in 2022. See Issue 131 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 149, Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion (578 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period) in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024. S&amp;P downgrades Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s credit rating to &#x2018;CC,&apos; citing the approaching default on Eurobonds. On Dec. 20, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s (S&amp;P) downgraded Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s credit rating to &#x2018;CC&#x2019; (negative outlook) from &#x2018;CCC+&#x2019; following the company&#x2019;s proposal to defer repayment of two Eurobond issues for a year. S&amp;P highlighted a material weakening in Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s debt-repayment capacity, noting that a default on its debt is almost certain as per the agency&#x2019;s methodology. The negative outlook reflects the expectation that Ukrzaliznytsia is likely to implement its debt restructuring plans in the next few weeks, which would be tantamount to a default, the agency added. On Dec. 16, Ukrzaliznytsia asked its creditors to renegotiate repayment terms for two Eurobond series: $594.9 million at 8.25% (due in 2026) and $300 million at 7.875% (due in 2028). The company proposed that bondholders should approve raising an additional 99 million euros from the EBRD while deferring interest payments to bondholders on securities during 2025-2026. In return, Ukrzaliznytsia undertakes not to repay debts of more than $20 million to its other creditors (except for the EBRD) during this period. Ukrzaliznytsia explained that inflation and rising electricity and diesel prices were increasing pressure on its liquidity. The company announced that it asked the state to increase freight tariffs by 37%, which had not been raised in two and a half years. Ukrzaliznytsia also argued that it had suffered significant financial losses and infrastructure damage due to a full-scale Russian invasion. The holders of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s Eurobonds could vote on the new terms until Dec. 27. The decision was set to be made at a meeting of bondholders scheduled for Dec. 31 in London, Forbes Ukraine added. According to Forbes Ukraine, the creditors had allowed Ukrzaliznytsia to restructure the debt on these bonds in 2022. As part of the restructuring, the repayment of the company&#x2019;s debt on Eurobonds issued in 2019 and 2021 totalling $895 million was postponed to 2026 and 2028, respectively. Coupon payments that were due in 2023-2024 are scheduled for January 2025. As we wrote in September, Ukrzaliznytsia made a profit of up to Hr 3 billion (70.5 million euros) in the first half of 2024, but lost Hr 600-700 million (13-15.5 million euros) in July 2024 due to a decline in profitable types of cargo. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia receives a record 480 million euros in loans from the EBRD to purchase electric locomotives and install generators, the company said on Dec. 19. As part of the signed agreements, Ukrzaliznytsia would receive the 480 million euros under state guarantees to finance two critically important programs, the company explained. The first one is to upgrade Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s locomotive fleet, with the EBRD providing an 18-year loan of up to 300 million euros for the purchase of electric locomotives. The second program involves the construction of gas-fired power generation. The EBRD will allocate 180 million euros, with a 10-year loan, the company said. About 65 million euros in grant funds from donors will also be accumulated for the implementation of this project. A grant of about 12 million euros from the UK Government through the Energy Community has already been confirmed. In total, the company aims to purchase and install complete gas-piston power plants at its locations, which will be able to generate about 255 MW, Ukrzaliznytsia noted. As we wrote in July 2024, Ukrzaliznytsia aimed to invest 215 million euros in gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of up to 250 MW. This estimate did not include the cost of construction. The payback period was about five years. See Issue 139 for more detail. Later in July, we reported that Ukrzaliznytsia would receive a 43-million-euro grant from the EU to integrate Ukraine&#x2019;s railway system with the EU&#x2019;s. See Issue 142 for more detail. AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrey Molchanov, sold. On Dec. 19, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold AEROC, one of the largest producers of aerated concrete products in Ukraine, for Hr 1.9 billion (43.1 million euros). The starting price of Hr 965 million (21.9 million euros) more than doubled during the auction. According to Prozorro.Sale, the winner is Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC, owned by businessman Gennadii Butkevych. Trident Geoinvest Ukraine&#x2019;s bid exceeded the second-highest bid by Professional Engineering Company LLC, owned by Ikram Djavadov (Hr 1.6 billion or 36 million euros), by almost Hr 300 million, and the third-highest bid by DC BC1 LLC, owned by Tom&#xE1;&#x161; Fiala (Hr 1.54 billion or ca. 35 million euros), by Hr 350 million. The sale of AEROC marks Ukraine&#x2019;s third online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, following the privatizations of the Ukraine Hotel and UMCC (see Issues 148 and 151 for more detail. As we wrote earlier, SPFU planned to privatise AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrei Molchanov. See our Issues 97, 100, 106, and 110 for more detail. On July 12, the Cabinet added AEROC to the large-scale privatization list. See Issue 140. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and PRO-Consulting, AEROC is one of the largest aerated concrete producers in Ukraine. The company owns two plants in Obukhiv and Berezan (Kyiv oblast), which have been idle since July 2022. The capacity of these plants exceeds 1 million cubic meters per year, while total aerated concrete production in Ukraine in 2020 was 4 million cubic meters. AEROC also has an unfinished plant in Stryi (Lviv oblast), EP added. The SPFU also said that the winner has 30 working days from the date of the auction to pay the lot price, and the sale and purchase agreement would only be signed after that payment. As of the end of June 2024, the company had wage arrears, budget arrears, and overdue accounts payable. The total amount of debt is more than Hr 110.8 million (2.5 million euros at the average exchange rate at the time), which the new owner also must repay. The new owner is also obliged to maintain the company&#x2019;s core business and may not lay out employees for six months, the SPFU added. [Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC is a part of Butkevych&#x2019;s BGV Group Management. &#x201C;AERO&#x421;&#x2019;s newly acquired plants would complement the group&#x2019;s strategic directions, which the company aims to actively expand in the upcoming years. BGV&#x2019;s investments are centered around energy, infrastructure development and restoration, and general development. The group&#x2019;s flagship company, BGV Development, is constructing five commercial and residential real estate projects in Zhytomyr and Kyiv,&#x201D; BGV Group said. The group added that Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC would maintain the business&#x2019;s core operations and settle all debt obligations, totalling Hr 110.8 million, within six months. The company plans to develop the enterprise under a new brand in the future. Gennadii Butkevych is also a co-owner of ATB-Market, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest supermarket chain measured by number of stores. He is also an owner and president of the Polissia football club.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-state-owned-enterprises-weekly-issue-159/	2025-01-03T05:46:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-821523200.jpg
Number of Ukrainians open to territorial concessions rises to 38%, poll shows	Around 38% of Ukrainians are open to conceding some of the territories while preserving independence in order to end the war with Russia as fast as possible, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey published on Jan. 3. The poll comes amid growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The responses, collected between Dec. 2 and 17, 2024, show a moderate increase since October, when 32% of the respondents were willing to compromise on territorial integrity for a faster peace deal. Only 19% agreed with the statement in December 2023 and 8% in December 2022, making the December 2024 figures the highest since the KIIS began the measurements in May 2022. The all-out war, which will mark its third anniversary in less than two months, has put a massive strain on the Ukrainian state, society, and the military, while the Russian offensive has picked up pace in recent months. Comparatively, 51% of respondents in December 2024 said that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories &quot;under no circumstances... even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence.&quot; This is a drop from 58% in October 2024, 74% in December 2023, and 85% in December 2022. The question did not specify which territories could be given up nor whether they should be officially recognized as Russian territory or &quot;merely&quot; remain temporarily under Russian occupation. The survey involved 2,000 respondents across Ukraine-controlled territories who were interviewed via phone. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine currently lacks the military strength to retake all of the occupied territories and that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomacy. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also acknowledged the possibility of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;gradual&quot; accession to NATO, with Article 5 initially not extending to occupied territories but strictly rejected recognizing Russian occupation as legitimate. The Ukrainian military finds itself increasingly on the back foot as Russian forces continue pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast and Moscow occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory in the east and south of the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/38-percent-ukrainians-territorial-concessions/	2025-01-03T04:58:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1244780383.jpg
Ukraine's largest steelmaker launches production of Patriot system armor	Engineers of Metinvest, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest steel producer, developed an armored protection for the control module of the Patriot air defense system, the company announced on Jan. 3. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany, one from the U.S., and one from Romania. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. Throughout the full-scale war, there were several reports of damage to Patriot systems during Russia&apos;s aerial attacks. Ukraine also uses mock-ups to protect the Patriots. &quot;In a month and a half, we created a project from scratch and made a shield from Metinvest&apos;s Ukrainian armor steel for the Patriot air defense system crew, which guarantees protection against debris damage to both the defenders and the air defense control center,&quot; said Oleksandr Myronenko, a COO of Metinvest Group. Weighing over 2.6 tons, the armor consists of nearly 200 elements, including armored steel plates up to 8 milimeters thick. According to the company, the weight of the armor does not affect the system&apos;s functionality or mobility. The company is also producing steel shields for T-64 and T-72 tanks, U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks, and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and is preparing to integrate shields into various Leopard 2 tank modifications.	https://kyivindependent.com/metinvest-armor-for-patriots/	2025-01-03T04:46:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-157737400.jpg
Poland didn't invite Orban, Hungarian envoy to EU presidency opening event	Poland has not invited Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Hungary&apos;s ambassador to the opening event of Warsaw&apos;s presidency of the EU Council on Jan. 3, Reuters reported, citing Polish Deputy European Affairs Minister Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka. The reason is Budapest granting political asylum to former Polish Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Romanowski, who is investigated at home for suspected misuse of funds. Though close partners under Poland&apos;s previous conservative government, Hungary and Poland have been increasingly at odds since the coalition of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office in December 2023. &quot;When we invited guests to our gala almost a month ago, we invited the entire diplomatic corps,&quot; Sobkowiak-Czarnecka said. &quot;But after the situation with Minister Romanowski, (Polish Foreign) Minister (Radoslaw) Sikorski decided that the Hungarian ambassador is not a welcome guest in the theater today.&quot; Stark differences on key policy issues also aggravate the mounting tensions between Warsaw and Budapest. While Poland has supported Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russian aggression throughout the full-scale war and took a pro-EU turn under Tusk, Orban&apos;s Hungary has opposed military aid to Kyiv and repeatedly clashed with Brussels over the rule of law issues. Poland began its sixth-month rotating presidency of the EU Council on Jan. 1, taking over the role from Hungary. Tusk said that security would be a &quot;top priority&quot; for Poland&apos;s presidency and pledged continued support for Ukraine. The Hungarian chairmanship was seen as controversial, namely due to Orban&apos;s visit to Moscow in July, which led to EU officials and leaders boycotting some of the Hungary-hosted EU events.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-not-inviting-hungary-eu-event/	2025-01-03T03:59:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2097682027.jpg
Russia plans to redeploy some arms, equipment from Syria to Libya, Ukraine's intel claims	Russia is planning to ship some military equipment and weapons from the Tartus naval base in Syria to Libya, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Jan. 3. Rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early December. Amid the fall of Assad&apos;s rule, Russia has reportedly begun withdrawing its naval and military assets from Syria. Some mercenaries of Russia&apos;s Africa Corps are stationed at the Tartus base on the Mediterranean coast, HUR said. Russia&apos;s Africa Corps reportedly emerged in 2023 and consists of over 2,000 soldiers and officers, as well as experienced mercenaries, many of whom previously served in the Wagner Group. Africa Corps, sharing the name with Nazi World War II-era units in Africa, was likely previously deployed in Syria, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Niger. According to the agency, Russian large landing ships Ivan Gren and Alexander Otrakovsky, as well as the dry cargo ship Sparta, are scheduled to arrive in the Syrian port on Jan. 5. Two more Russian vessels &#x2014; the universal cargo vessel Sparta II and the tanker Ivan Skoblev &#x2014; are expected to arrive on Jan. 8. &quot;Russia plans to use the Sparta and Sparta II cargo ships to transport military equipment and weapons from Syria to Libya,&quot; HUR said. Another Russian warship, the frigate Admiral Golovko, is reportedly planning to refuel. Armored personnel carriers, presumably taken from Syria, had already been relocated to one of the airfields in Russia&apos;s Vladimir Oblast, the agency noted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier, HUR said that losing the Tartus and Khmeimim bases would significantly damage Russia&apos;s presence in the Middle East and solidify its defeat in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-planning-to-redeploy-some-weapons-military-material-from-syria-to-libya-ukraines-intel-claims/	2025-01-03T03:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
Ukrainians in Poland receive fake military summonses	Ukrainian men living in Poland have begun receiving fake military draft notices, threatening them with legal repercussions if they evade service, the Polish RMF24 news outlet reported on Jan. 3. Poland&apos;s Office for Foreigners, which the letter falsely attributes as the author, stressed that it did not issue the document and that its content is fake. Ukraine&apos;s Embassy in Warsaw also denied the document&apos;s authenticity. Almost 1 million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland after they fled Russia&apos;s all-out invasion that broke out in February 2022. &quot;The Office for Foreigners emphasizes that it is not the author of such letters,&quot; the Polish government agency said, publishing a scanned copy of the letter written in Polish. A scanned copy of the fake letter in Polish sent to Ukrainian men in Poland, threatening them with legal reprecussions if they avoid military service. (Poland&apos;s Office for Foreigners)The authors impersonating the Polish authorities threaten the recipients with visits to the place of residence between Dec. 17-31 to bring the Ukrainian men to the relevant &quot;mobilization point in connection with the obligation to perform military service in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.&quot; The letter goes on to threaten the recipients with criminal reliability, including extradition, in case of draft evasion. It remains unclear who the real author of the letter is or how many Ukrainian men have received it. The Polish authorities previously signaled a willingness to help Kyiv bring military-age men back to their home country as Ukraine struggles to replenish its Armed Forces&apos; ranks. The EU rejected the idea of forcibly deporting Ukrainian men, and no member country has put forward such a proposal. Instead, Warsaw proposed ending social benefits for fighting-age Ukrainian men. Ukraine has also launched the new Ukrainian Legion in Poland, a volunteer unit manned by Ukrainians living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The unit&apos;s members can return to Poland after completing their service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-in-poland-receiving-fake-military-summonses/	2025-01-03T02:57:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1620826063.jpg
Next Ramstein summit to be held on Jan. 9	The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Jan. 3, citing the U.S. Air Force. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton. No further details about the upcoming Ramstein summit have been provided. The meeting will take place as Russian troops continue to push forward in Donetsk Oblast, advancing near the key town of Pokrovsk. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff recorded 138 clashes on the battlefield over the past day. The U.S. is ramping up its military aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office later this month. The latest security assistance package announced by the Biden administration in December was worth nearly $2.5 billion. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-summit-to-be-held-on-jan-9-media-reports/	2025-01-03T02:06:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
Ukraine investigating French-trained brigade after reports of desertions, mismanagement	Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority in the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, the bureau confirmed for Suspilne on Jan. 2. The statement comes following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv Rus princess and spouse to French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. France fulfilled its obligations regarding training and arms, said Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net outlet, in the media investigation, putting the blame for the unit&apos;s problems on top Ukrainian military and political leadership. According to the journalist, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. The military laid the blame for desertions in France on the brigade&apos;s commander, Dmytro Riumshin, who was dismissed in early December alongside several other top officers. The new commanders were unaware of the problems plaguing the unit, adding to the confusion, Butusov wrote. The 155th Brigade did not reportedly receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command. This, in addition to poor organization and insufficient training, is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in combat in November. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry declined to comment on the investigation when approached by the media. &quot;The investigation is ongoing. It is too early to talk about any preliminary results,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation told Suspilne. The news comes amid growing calls for reform in the Ukrainian military leadership as Kyiv finds itself increasingly on the back foot in the war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-investigating-french-trained-brigade/	2025-01-03T01:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2176905143.jpg
Russian court reportedly orders Yandex to block access to oil refinery's maps, photos over Ukrainian drone attacks	A Moscow court ordered Russia&apos;s most popular search engine Yandex to remove photos of an oil refinery in one of the Russian regions from online maps due to the threat of Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian state-controlled TASS news agency reported on Jan. 2, citing documents. According to the court&apos;s decision, Yandex must &quot;exclude information access&quot; to the refinery&apos;s infrastructure. Over the past year, Ukraine has launched a series of drone strikes targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is a driver of Russia&apos;s economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. The lawsuit was filed by an unnamed &quot;supervisory agency,&quot; which found information about all the refinery&apos;s facilities in the public domain. The facility&apos;s location was not disclosed. This is the first court decision that obliged the Russian tech giant to remove from public access photos and maps of a strategically important facility for the defense industry, according to TASS. The oil refinery plant &quot;operates in an uninterrupted mode, providing the needs of the Russian army and navy&quot; during the all-out war against Ukraine and was attacked four times by Ukrainian drones in 2024, resulting in damage to the company&apos;s infrastructure, the lawsuit said. The court ruled that open access to maps and photos of the refinery &quot;undermine the defense capability of the state&quot; and &quot;have a negative impact on the timely supply of materials&quot; to the Russian army, TASS wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-orders-yandex-to-block-access-to-oil-refinerys-maps-photos-over-ukrainian-drone-attacks/	2025-01-03T01:27:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-459985760.jpg
Russia has recruited up to 180,000 convicts for war against Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service says	Russia has recruited 140,000 to 180,000 prisoners to fight in a full-scale war against Ukraine as of November 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) said on Jan. 2. Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war since summer 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner mercenary company and then directly under the Russian Defense Ministry. There were about 300,000-350,000 prisoners in Russian prisons in 2024, which is half as many as in 2014, according to the Ukrainian intelligence agency. &quot;The reason is the Russia-Ukraine war,&quot; the statement read. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims. A Russian government decree abolishing the one-time payment of $3,524 to prisoners for signing a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry to participate in the war against Ukraine came into effect on Jan. 1. &quot;The legislative abolition of the one-time payment is evidence of the deepening crisis in the Russian economy and the shortage of financial resources,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service claimed. Prisoners and their relatives are deprived of a number of payments and benefits received by members of volunteer formations. Salaries of prisoners are also two to four times lower than that of other Russian soldiers, the agency said. Dozens of men convicted of violent crimes were allowed to return to Russia following their service. In some cases, these ex-convicts were accused of new crimes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-recruits-up-to-180-000-convicts-for-war-against-ukraine-foreign-intelligence-service-says/	2025-01-02T23:57:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Kursk incursion had 'big impact' on Global South countries, Zelensky says	Ukraine&apos;s incursion in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast is a &quot;very strong trump card in any negotiations,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. &quot;Especially with countries that are very important for us, the countries of the Global South,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I never thought it would have such a big impact on them because they were so influenced by the idea of &apos;invincible Russia.&apos;&quot; Russia has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a piece of Russian territory in the hopes of leveraging it in possible negotiations. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Ukrainian forces launched the unprecedented Kursk invasion in early August, achieving initial tactical success and marking the first time Russia was invaded at a significant since World War II. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the defensive as Russia reportedly recaptured almost half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The strategic impact of the Kursk incursion has been hotly debated. Critics have pointed out that despite its stated goal of drawing away Russian forces from their offensive in Donetsk Oblast, Moscow&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has only picked up pace since the incursion began. In the interview, Zelensky called the deployment of North Korean soldiers in the region a &quot;tactical mistake.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s why there are 12,000 (North Koreans) who came with weapons, and the North Korean soldiers also couldn&apos;t do anything. All this works against Russia and is a strong argument for us.&quot; The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-on-kursk-incursion/	2025-01-02T23:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure at least 13 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured at least 13 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 3. Ukrainian forces downed 60 out of 93 drones, including Shahed-type ones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 26 drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. The wreckage of downed Russian drones killed a truck driver born in 1999 in Kyiv Oblast overnight, acting Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said. Debris also damaged a house near the town of Bila Tserkva, causing a fire and injuring two people, including a 16-year-old boy, according to State Emergency Service. One more woman suffered injuries from the attack near Fastiv in the region. One person was killed in the town of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 39 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Ten people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces also carried out an air strike on a residential area in the city of Sumy on the morning of Jan. 3. No casualties have been reported so far. Search and rescue operations are ongoing.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day-4/	2025-01-02T23:03:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-03_07-22-13.jpg
We would violate Ukrainian legislation on behalf of Putin' — Zelensky again rejects elections under martial law	Ukraine will not hold elections under martial law even if Russia puts it forward as one of the pre-conditions for negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution. In the interview, Zelensky reiterated that presidential and parliamentary elections are not possible under martial law and that the elected officials continue to legally perform their duties until the next vote. After Ukraine manages to end the hot stage of the war, maintains a strong army, and secures powerful security guarantees, martial law can be lifted, and the parliament can set a date for the elections, the president said. &quot;After martial law ends, there is no need to wait years for the elections,&quot; Zelensky added. When asked whether Ukraine is ready to compromise if Russia sets immediate elections as a condition for peace talks, Zelensky dismissed the idea. &quot;We would violate Ukrainian legislation on behalf of Putin, who has violated all our legislation, sovereignty, and territorial integrity,&quot; the president responded. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-again-rejects-elections-under-martial-law/	2025-01-02T22:53:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 793,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 793,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3. This number includes 1,080 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,677 tanks, 20,070 armored fighting vehicles, 32,770 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,555 artillery systems, 1,257 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 330 helicopters, 21,249 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-793-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-02T22:13:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188573525.jpg
Kerch Strait oil spill significantly smaller than initially thought, Russia claims	The amount of oil spilled in the Kerch Strait by two Russian oil tankers is &quot;significantly less than the initial estimate,&quot; Russia&apos;s Transport Ministry claimed on Jan. 2. Two Russian oil tankers,Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, suffered severe damage during a storm on Dec. 15. Both vessels were reportedly carrying a total of 9,200 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti initially reported that some 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil have spilled into the Kerch Strait, forcing Russia to declare a federal state of emergency in response to the spill. Russian scientist Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said in a press conference on Dec. 25 that about 200,000 tons of soil along the Black Sea coast have been contaminated, while Greenpeace Ukraine warned on Dec. 16 that the destruction of the Russian oil tankers could cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage. On Jan. 2, Russia&apos;s Transport Ministry claimed that only about 2,400 metric tons of oil had spilled, citing a skewed account &quot;of one of the tanker captains.&quot; The Transport Ministry added that the M100-grade fuel oil spilled into the sea solidifies at a lower temperature, thus sinking to the surface instead of remaining at the surface. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. The Kerch Strait separates mainland Russia from Russian-occupied Crimea. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land. -	https://kyivindependent.com/kerch-strait-oil-spill-significantly-smaller-than-initially-thought-russia-claims/	2025-01-02T18:21:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1477538300.jpg
Trump can be decisive in ending war' —Zelensky on Ukraine's outlook for 2025	President Volodymyr Zelensky, joined alongside his wife First Lady Olena Zelenska, delivered a candid, wide-ranging interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2, laying out his vision for Ukraine&apos;s prospects of a potential peace in 2025. &quot;How many days did 2024 have? 1,000?&quot; Zelensky joked before addressing questions about the potential end of the war in 2025. The interview comes just weeks ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, who has vowed to shift Ukraine&apos;s prospects after assuming office and negotiate a way out of the war. Over the course of the hour-long interview, Zelensky delved into a wide-range of topics &#x2014; both of domestic and international significance &#x2014; as Ukraine faces the daunting task of securing a lasting peace as the start of the fourth year of full-scale war. When asked about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Zelensky was clear about the impact he can make on the prospects of ending the war in 2025. &quot;He can be decisive in ending war... or, more realistically, he can help us stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. He can do this,&quot; Zelensky said, adding, &quot;I believe he truly wants to end this war.&quot; Trump&apos;s pledge to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal has received mixed reaction in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia as Trump has nominated some officials seen as more conservative and skeptical about providing military aid to Ukraine. &quot;I believe Putin is scared of Trump. That&apos;s why he&apos;s taking steps to get some of the Kremlin&apos;s voice somehow into the Trump administration,&quot; Zelensky said. Despite some more controversial appointments, Trump has also selected key figures seen in a positive light in Kyiv, including U.S. General Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy. &quot;Thus far, I have not had any negative interactions in our relations (with the Trump administration),&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. &quot;The most important aspect is that we build these relationships.&quot; Following the appointment of Kellogg, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said that Kellogg was &quot;not a new person for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S. has maintained close ties with him, in particular within the framework of expert diplomacy in recent years, and has developed and maintained a good dialogue with him during this time,&quot; Tykhyi added. Kellogg has echoed Trump&apos;s commitment to ending the war, saying in a December interview that he believes the war will be &quot;resolved in the next few months.&quot; Kellogg has agreed to visit Kyiv following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Since Trump&apos;s election victory in November, Kyiv has made concerted efforts to strengthen ties with the incoming administration, even meeting Trump amid the 2024 presidential election campaign. The history between the two leaders is fraught, stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial, which revolved around allegations that Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. Despite this, Trump recently remarked that he &quot;likes&quot; Zelensky and had a &quot;good relationship&quot; with him during his previous term. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. During the interview, Zelensky also touched on Ukraine&apos;s pressing need for robust security guarantees. &quot;Any security guarantees without the United States are weak security guarantees for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;To be honest, Europeans are keeping their eyes out on the opinion of the president of the United States.&quot; The Ukrainian president weighed in on French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s efforts to advocate for European soldiers as potential peacekeepers in Ukraine. While he welcomed ideas surrounding the initiative, Zelensky underscored the necessity of broader European participation. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t want (the peacekeeping initiative) to be just one, two countries, if it get to this initiative,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that any potential path forward to a permanent security guarantees must be through the country&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I see that Trump has a positive impression of the idea,&quot; Zelensky said regarding potential European peacekeepers in Ukraine. Following a meeting with Zelensky and Macron in Paris in early December, Trump reportedly made clear he wants to see Europe take up leadership of monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;The hot phase of the war may end rather quickly if Trump is strong in his position, and I believe that his position should fall in line with those of European allies,&quot; Zelensky said when asked the possibility of the war ending following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Despite the possibility of upcoming peace negotiations, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine&apos;s priority remains accession into the NATO military alliance. Zelensky added that the presence of European troops along Ukraine&apos;s front line would not negate the country&apos;s NATO ambitions. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. Despite Ukraine&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance, in recent months, Ukraine has shifted its rhetoric suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO remains on the agenda but diplomatic efforts currently focus on obtaining strong security guarantees. &quot;In short, a just peace for us is the understanding that we are in the EU and when. The understanding that we strong security guarantees, with NATO as the best option,&quot; Zelensky concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-interview/	2025-01-02T16:35:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188205516.jpg
US looking into restricting or banning drones made by 'foreign adversaries,' including China, Russia	The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Jan. 2 that it would explore how to secure the technology and supply chain of drones from foreign adversaries, including China and Russia. The department&apos;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement that it was seeking public consultation &quot;to inform the potential development of a rule to secure and safeguard the information and communication technology and services (ICTS) supply chain for drones.&quot; The agency added that the involvement of foreign adversaries in &quot;supply chains, including acute threats from China and Russia &#x2013; may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive U.S. data.&quot; The U.S. and China &#x2014; which produces a majority of the world&apos;s drones &#x2014; have a frosty relationship, exacerbated by opposing views on foreign policy, including China&apos;s stance on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and U.S. support for Taiwan. The U.S. blacklisted 37 Chinese companies due to security concerns on May 9. &quot;Securing the unmanned aircraft systems technology supply chain is critical to safeguarding our national security. This (advance notice of proposed rulemaking) is an essential step in protecting the United States from vulnerabilities posed by foreign entities,&quot; U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Jan. 2. If implemented, the proposed rule change may restrict or ban drones from countries the U.S. deems as foreign adversaries. In March 2024 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill requiring TikTok&apos;s Chinese parent company, ByteDance to sell its stakes in the company within six months or lose access to U.S. markets. The U.S. is increasingly becoming more watchful of its own national security amid high-profile incidents such as foreign interference in U.S. elections. Ukraine previously announced a ban on the use of software and websites from Russia and other sanctioned countries on Aug. 16, following high-profile cyber attacks that threatened Ukraine&apos;s national security.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-commerce-department-looking-into-restricting-or-banning-chinese-drones/	2025-01-02T16:21:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-sb10066698qn-001.jpg
Transnistria faces industrial collapse after Russian gas suspension, senior official says	The cessation of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has halted all industrial activity in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, said on Jan. 2. Russia&#x2019;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials, however, argue that these debts haven&#x2019;t been verified by an international audit. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&#x2019;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. The halt has left Transnistria without sufficient energy, resulting in widespread heating outages. Obolonik described the gas crisis as &quot;grave,&quot; with shortages cutting supply to nearly 75,000 households and leaving another 116,000 with reduced volumes. He warned that prolonged disruptions could cause irreversible damage to the region&#x2019;s industrial capacity. Moldova has offered to assist Transnistria in purchasing gas through European platforms. Vadim Cheban, head of Moldovagaz, announced that Chisinau is prepared to support Transnistrian authorities in securing energy resources on market terms to address the crisis. Moldova&#x2019;s state-owned energy company, Energocom, will import electricity from Romania and Ukraine to address a shortfall caused by Russia&#x2019;s gas supply halt. Starting in January, 62% of Moldova&#x2019;s electricity needs will be met by imports from Romania, while 30% will come from local thermal plants and renewable energy. Energocom plans to import surplus electricity from Ukraine&#x2019;s state nuclear operator, Energoatom, during off-peak hours. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean criticized the Kremlin for using energy as a &quot;political weapon,&quot; a concern echoed across Europe as nations reduce dependency on Russian gas. Moldova, an EU candidate aiming for membership by 2030, has heightened security efforts following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s, after Moscow&#x2019;s intervention under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government, as Moldova faces growing regional security threats.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-faces-industrial-collapse-after-russian-gas-suspension-senior-official-says/	2025-01-02T11:51:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv strikes Russian command post in Kursk Oblast, General Staff claims	Key developments on Jan. 2: The Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted a precision strike on a Russian army command post in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 2. &quot;These attacks are primarily carried out to weaken Russia&apos;s ability and willingness to carry out terrorist acts against Ukrainian civilians,&quot; the General Staff said, adding that &quot;all necessary measures&quot; were taken to minimize risks to civilians in the vicinity of the strike. It did not specify the type of weapon used in the attack. The strike targeted the 810th Russian Brigade, resulting in significant losses, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s counter-disinformation center. Local Telegram channels earlier reported shelling in Ivanovskoye in the Rylsk district, with damage to a boarding school, post office, shopping center, residential buildings, and the house of culture. Windows were shattered, and walls were damaged by shrapnel, according to acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The strike follows Ukraine&#x2019;s surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, during which Ukrainian forces captured about 1,300 square kilometers of territory. While Kyiv has since lost control of half of the initially seized area, fighting in the region remains intense. Ukrainian officials view the occupied territory as a potential bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Two Russian helicopters were downed in a recent strike by the Ukrainian-made Magura V5 naval strike drones, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on its Telegram channel. HUR earlier reported on Dec. 31 that one of its units had downed an aerial target with the Ukrainian-made Magura drone equipped with SeeDragon missiles for the first time, destroying one Russian Mi-8 helicopter and damaging another helicopter. According to an updated statement by HUR published on Jan. 2, two helicopters were downed and one was damaged in the attack. Russian propaganda channels admitted the loss of two helicopters earlier. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&#x2019;s claims. The Magura drone has helped Ukraine push back against Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet by striking dozens of ships this year. They have been in operation since the summer of 2023. The drone is able to cover a distance of more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), reach a speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), and is capable of carrying a 250-kilogram warhead. Each one is 5.5 meters long and costs approximately Hr 10 million ($240,000). In June, HUR announced that the drones had been modified to operate anti-aircraft missiles, presenting a serious threat to the Russian Air Force over the Black Sea. Ukraine is to carry out a comprehensive review of the Ground Forces command, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 2, to be conducted by the Defense Ministry&#x2019;s Main Inspectorate. &quot;Victory requires a deep analysis of experience, and an honest understanding of mistakes,&quot; Umerov said. The review aims to evaluate management structures, processes, and compliance with legislation to support reforms and enhance battlefield effectiveness. The announcement comes after newly appointed Ground Forces Commander General Mykhailo Drapatyi unveiled plans on Dec. 12 for fundamental reforms to strengthen the branch. Umerov said the analysis would provide Drapatyi with a full picture of the state of affairs in the Ground Forces. &quot;Events in the Ground Forces directly affect the situation on the front,&quot; Umerov said, underscoring the strategic importance of the reforms. Based on the findings, the Defense Ministry plans to introduce reforms in personnel policies, optimize management processes, and improve combat capabilities with new training approaches. Drapatyi&#x2019;s proposed changes include revamping the recruitment system, which will have zero tolerance for corruption, enhanced front-line training, and integration of advanced technology into operations. The reforms come amid reported personnel shortages, with slow mobilization efforts leaving some front-line units undermanned. Drapatyi has highlighted the need to reform training curricula and prioritize social support for service members to prepare for modern warfare effectively. Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded six and killed four people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 2. Two civilians were killed and six were injured in Kherson Oblast following Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, high-rise buildings, and houses in over 38 of the oblast&#x2019;s settlements, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A Russian attack overnight killed a civilian in the town of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel on Jan. 2. One person was killed in the city of Mirnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. Russia launched 72 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed ones, against Ukraine overnight on Jan. 2, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on its Telegram channel. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 47 drones over 12 oblasts, and forced an additional 24 to veer off course without casualties, the Air Force said. One drone was in the air at the time of the publication of the Air Force&#x2019;s report. Civilian infrastructure, buildings and a car were damaged as a result of Russian attacks in Kharkiv Oblast, but there were no civilian injuries, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-strikes-russian-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-02T11:06:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Slovakia may cut aid to Ukrainian refugees over Russian gas transit halt, PM Fico says	Slovakia could reduce aid for Ukrainian refugees in response to Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to terminate Russian gas transit through its territory, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Jan. 2 While Fico said that Slovak households would not face energy shortages, he said Slovakia stands to lose &#x20AC;500 million ($513 million) annually in transit revenue. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. Fico criticized Ukraine&apos;s stance, saying Ukraine &quot;dared to complain about Bratislava&apos;s consideration of retaliatory measures.&quot; &quot;On behalf of Smer (the ruling party), I announce that we are ready to negotiate and agree in a coalition to cut off electricity supplies and significantly reduce support for Ukrainian citizens staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic,&quot; he added. The announcement follows Fico&#x2019;s earlier threats to cut off electricity exports to Ukraine amid escalating blackouts caused by Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. He also confirmed that Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives will meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the shutdown, reportedly at Kyiv&#x2019;s request. Despite EU efforts to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains reliant on Russian gas under a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Switching to alternative supply routes could cost Slovakia an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($229 million) in transit fees.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-may-cut-aid-to-ukrainian-refugees-over-gas-transit-halt-pm-fico-says/	2025-01-02T10:22:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg
Finland requests seizure of Russian 'shadow fleet' tanker over suspected cable sabotage	Finland&apos;s national grid operator Fingrid has asked a court to seize the Eagle S oil tanker in connection with the damage to the Estlink 2 undersea electricity cable, Reuters reported on Jan. 2. The cable, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) critical infrastructure component linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to have been seriously damaged on Dec. 25, prompting an investigation into possible sabotage. Finnish authorities suspect the damage was caused by the Eagle S oil tanker, allegedly part of Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to circumvent sanctions. Fingrid has filed a claim with the Helsinki District Court to seize the tanker as part of securing financial reparations. &quot;Further investigations at the damage site are expected to provide more information about the extent of the damages and enable more detailed planning and scheduling of the repair,&quot; Fingrid said, adding that repairs are expected to be completed by August. NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. The damaged cable is one of several recent incidents in the Baltic Sea under investigation as possible acts of sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-requests-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-over-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-02T10:05:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg

Russia loses key leverage over Europe after Ukraine halts gas transit, FM Sybiha says	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Jan. 2 that halting the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine has stripped the Kremlin of one of its remaining tools to pressure European nations. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. &quot;Ukraine has cut off more than just Russian gas transit. We have cut off some of Putin&#x2019;s last remaining leverage over Europe, and his use of energy as a weapon,&quot; Sybiha posted on X. He added that Europe and the world would be safer without Russian energy dependencies. The decision comes amid a significant reduction in European reliance on Russian gas following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary remain dependent on Russian supplies. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico have opposed Ukraine&apos;s decision. The halt also caused a major gas outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which relied on transit through Ukraine, according to its gas supplier Tiraspoltransgaz-Pridnestrovie. The move reflects Ukraine&#x2019;s broader strategy to weaken Russia&#x2019;s economic influence and reduce its ability to use energy as a weapon against Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/halting-russian-gas-transit-removes-kremlins-leverage-over-europe-fm-sybiha-says/	2025-01-02T08:37:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg
Citing Orban’s 'corruption,' Hungarian opposition leader calls for early elections in video address	Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections in a New Year&#x2019;s video address on Jan. 1, citing Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s declining popularity and allegations of corruption. Orban has faced mounting criticism domestically and internationally for his pro-Moscow stance, including opposition to EU sanctions on Russia and military aid for Ukraine. &quot;Let there be a new election to return the right of deciding their fate to the people,&quot; Magyar said, marking his first public demand for elections before the scheduled 2026 vote. He accused Orban of turning Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; &quot;You&apos;ve made Hungary the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; Opposition leader P&#xE9;ter Magyar&#x2019;s New Year&apos;s video message slamming Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&apos;s corruption and demanding early elections has gone viral, nearing 2M views on Hungarian social media.Excerpt with English captions.&#x1F447; pic.twitter.com/MvzEQo1k8z Magyar has taken a nuanced stance to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, echoing his government&#x2019;s opposition to sending Hungarian troops or weapons to Ukraine, but supporting Kyiv&#x2019;s right to self-defense. During a July 2023 visit to Kyiv, Magyar delivered humanitarian aid, and expressed solidarity with Ukraine after a Russian attack. Adding to Orban&#x2019;s challenges, Hungary lost &#x20AC;1.04 billion ($1.08 billion) in EU funding after failing to implement reforms to meet rule-of-law standards, the European Commission confirmed on Dec. 31. This marked the EU&apos;s first action of this kind against a member state. The reforms aimed to address issues in political financing, media independence, and conflict-of-interest laws but were not completed by the end-of-2024 deadline. Orban&#x2019;s 18 years in power have drawn both praise and criticism. While hailed by supporters as a champion of Hungarian conservatism, his tenure has been marred by allegations of authoritarianism, corruption, and democratic backsliding. Magyar&#x2019;s call for early elections underscores growing dissatisfaction with Orban&#x2019;s leadership as Hungary grapples with strained EU relations and domestic unrest.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-opposition-leader-calls-for-early-elections-citing-orbans-corruption-and-declining-popularity/	2025-01-02T08:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156270759.jpg

Polish farmers to protest Ukrainian imports, EU policies, in Warsaw on Jan. 3	Polish farmers are planning a large protest in Warsaw to voice opposition to agricultural imports from Ukraine, and EU agricultural policies, Farmer.pl reported on Jan. 2. The protest, which will take place on Jan. 3, follows a series of demonstrations by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports since the start of the full-scale war. Farmers argue that cheaper Ukrainian agricultural imports, allowed under the EU&apos;s free trade regime with Ukraine, have disrupted Poland&#x2019;s domestic market and hurt local producers. Organized by the Union of Agricultural Organizations, the protest will take place in front of the European Commission&#x2019;s office before moving to the National Theater. Tomasz Obszanski, leader of the Solidarnosc Individual Farmers&apos; Union, accused the European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, of imposing policies that he claims threaten the survival of Polish farms. As well as agricultural imports from Ukraine, the farmers say they are trying to highlight several other issues, including the EU&apos;s proposed free trade agreement with Mercosur, an economic union in South America, the EU&#x2019;s Green Deal policies, and the perceived decline of Poland&#x2019;s economy due to EU policies. Most recently, on Nov. 23, farmers staged a blockade at the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, which lasted just over a day and restricted truck traffic. Warsaw has already implemented bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture. The Polish government has expressed support for farmers&#x2019; concerns, highlighting challenges posed by the EU&#x2019;s trade policies while also seeking to maintain solidarity with Ukraine during the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-to-protest-ukrainian-imports-eu-policies-in-warsaw-on-jan-3/	2025-01-02T06:48:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2018750299.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 7	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 7 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 23-Dec. 31, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine launches competition for head of Bureau of Economic Security The race for the new head of Ukraine&#x2019;s Bureau of Economic Security is officially on. A draft law ensures transparent procedures of the competition and the decisive vote of independent international experts in the commission. The deadline for applications is Jan. 24, 2025. An International Monetary Fund-related deadline to appoint the new bureau head is the end of February. Ukrainian government registers two draft laws to meet IMF commitments On Dec. 30, Ukraine&#x2019;s Cabinet of Ministers submitted two critical bills to Parliament, aiming to fulfill structural benchmarks outlined in the IMF program. The first, draft law #12368, proposes the establishment of a Higher Administrative Court to replace the dissolved Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). The second, draft law #12367, seeks to repeal the controversial &quot;Lozovyi amendments.&quot; The texts of these bills have not yet been published on Parliament&#x2019;s website. While the deadline for their adoption under the IMF Memorandum is Dec. 31, it is widely expected that Ukrainian authorities will push for their adoption before the next IMF board meeting in February. Tax and customs exemptions extended for defense-related imports President Volodymyr Zelenksy has signed Laws #12266 and #12267, amending the Tax and Customs Codes to extend key exemptions into 2025. These include benefits for importing drones, components, and materials used in the production of ammunition and shells. Ukraine advances OECD membership agenda with new anti-corruption laws Zelensky has signed critical legislation to align Ukraine with OECD standards. Law #10319 introduces tax measures to combat bribery of foreign officials in international business, while Law #11443 adjusts corporate liability for corruption offenses to meet international benchmarks. These moves mark a significant stride in Ukraine&#x2019;s journey toward OECD membership. Shake-up in Ukraine&#x2019;s economic institutions On the last day of the year the Cabinet of Ministers made two personnel changes in Ukraine&#x2019;s economic oversight bodies. Ruslan Kravchenko, former governor of Kyiv region, was appointed as a new head of the State Tax Service, while Filip Pronin, ex-governor of Poltava region, became the head of the State Financial Monitoring Service. Both were appointed without competition selection which is possible according to martial law. Both are said to have close ties to Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-7/	2025-01-02T05:06:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg

Leader of German social-democrats supports more phone calls between Scholz and Putin	More phone calls should take place between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the leader of Germany&#x2019;s social-democratic party (SPD) Saskia Esken told German television news channel N-Tv on Jan. 2. &#x201C;These conversations must be held again and again in order to find out what can be done to finally put an end to the killing and the dying,&#x201D; she said. Social-democrat Chancellor Scholz held a call with Putin mid-November in 2024, drawing criticism from Western allies. Later, Scholz said that he was ready to call Putin again. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the chancellor&apos;s conversation with the Russian leader the opening of a &#x201C;Pandora&#x2019;s box.&#x201D; During that conversation in November 2024, Scholz condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end the invasion and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &#x201C;just and lasting peace.&#x201D; Esken does not currently support the idea of a public meeting between Putin and Scholz. &#x201C;As long as the attitudes remain unchanged, it is certainly sufficient to talk on the phone,&#x201D; she said. Germany is heading toward snap elections on Feb. 23, 2025, with right-wing conservative CDU/CSU leading the polls after Scholz fired FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the coalition&apos;s collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/leader-of-german-social-democrats-urges-more-phone-calls-between-scholz-and-putin/	2025-01-02T04:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1858823480.jpg
‘Ukraine today is in the strongest position ever,’ ex-foreign minister Kuleba says	As Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine inches toward the three-year mark, all eyes are on a potential peace agreement to end the war. If the parameters of any peace deal are likely to remain obscured for months to come, Ukraine&#x2019;s ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says one thing is clear &#x2014; Russia is not going to ask for peace. &#x201C;Russia wants to be begged (to engage in the peace talks),&#x201D; Kuleba told the Kyiv Independent in an interview late last year. Kuleba worked as a minister for over four years through most of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion until his resignation in September during the biggest wartime government reshuffle. He is one of the most recognized Ukrainian politicians abroad, known for his impassioned appeals to partners to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Amid news of the latest Russian advances on the front and global talks on how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will seek to negotiate an end to the war, the Kyiv Independent sat down with Kuleba in Kyiv to discuss a potential peace agreement and a path forward for Ukraine. Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a transcript of the video interview with the former foreign minister. It has been edited for clarity. The Kyiv Independent: What do you expect from the next few months? Dmytro Kuleba: I don&apos;t think any negotiations will begin before the inauguration of President Trump. We will spend the upcoming months in a whirlpool of news and comments and leaks coming from all corners about the peace talks, but even now, if you put the noise aside and look at the essence of what key stakeholders are saying, they just keep repeating the same speaking point in different ways. Everyone says, &#x201C;We want peace.&#x201D; Russia has a different stance on this. Russia wants to be begged &#x2014; this is its strategy. It doesn&#x2019;t want to make the first move, it wants others to approach it and beg it to do something. The Kyiv Independent: What do you say to people who want to build friendly ties with Russia again, especially in Europe? Dmytro Kuleba: It&apos;s hard to find someone who would openly tell you that they want to build good relations with Russia today, but there are people with the underlying argument that the day will come and there will be good Russia. They don&apos;t want to analyze the past in an unbiased way and admit that all attempts to democratize Russia failed. Liberal Russia exists only as a dystopia. It&apos;s a classic 19th-century empire. It&apos;s a country that wants to be seen and sees itself in terms of the classic 19th-century empire. We saw it with Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Japan, and Yugoslavia. And there is only one way to deprive a country of its aggressive instincts. And that is to take it through loss, through defeat. This is the only viable way of ensuring that the war will not repeat and that Russia will not pose a threat to anyone, not only to Ukraine but also to other countries. But the people you are referring to think differently. They come up with traditional foreign policy concepts and game-playing in politics, saying that there should not be a zero-sum outcome for everyone. &#x201C;Russia should get something,&#x201D; (they believe). And then we end up in this messy intellectual and political setting where partners want Ukraine to win, but they don&apos;t want Russia to lose. The Kyiv Independent: What would Ukraine winning without Russia losing look like? Dmytro Kuleba: It just doesn&apos;t work this way. If you make Ukraine win, but Russia doesn&apos;t lose, what you get is revanchism. Russia will immediately undertake another attempt to reach all the goals of what they call &#x201C;the special military operation.&#x201D; Russian guard soldiers carrying the Russian national flag and a red Soviet flag during the march on Red Square in Moscow, Russia on May 9, 2024. (Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)It will be just a pause before the next war between Russia and Ukraine starts. If you have something in the middle, where diplomats like to say that a good agreement is when either everyone walks out from the negotiating room happy or everyone walks out of the room unhappy, then it was a good deal. But if both Russia and Ukraine walk out of the negotiating room unhappy, this is again an invitation to revanchism for both sides. Ukraine&apos;s potential for revanchist policies toward Russia from a mid-term perspective should not be underestimated and written off. The Kyiv Independent: Could you elaborate on potential revanchist policies in Ukraine towards Russia? Dmytro Kuleba: The next generation of Ukrainian politicians will be focused entirely on the recovery of Ukraine after the war. But the generation after them will come to power on the slogans of revanche towards Russia. &#x201C;Retake territories, make Russia finally pay.&#x201D; The moment we are up from our knees economically, you will see these arguments being played out in domestic politics. The Kyiv Independent: There was an idea that sanctions were going to make it too costly for Russia to continue the war and it would stop at some point. We&apos;re not seeing it happening now. Is that because sanctions don&apos;t work? What can we do to make them work? Dmytro Kuleba: Sanctions, political isolation, support of providing Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance, resolve to deliver a message to Russia that it&#x2019;s not going to get what it&apos;s looking for &#x2014; when all these pieces come together, strengthening Ukraine and shattering Russia from the inside, then we will have victory. &#x201C;Sanctions don&apos;t work&#x201D; is a Russian narrative. Sanctions do work. But they serve their function on two conditions: first when you keep introducing new sanctions, stepping up pressure on the sanctioned country. And second, when you continuously and regularly close the loopholes that are used for the circumvention of sanctions. These two things have to work hand in hand. Unfortunately, we see desynchronization. People read headlines in the news like &#x201C;The European Union approved a new set of sanctions.&#x201D; People feel relieved that something is happening. But if you look deeper into the list of what was adopted, this is not really damaging stuff for them. Russia will keep selling its oil. The key to the Russian economy is, of course, revenues from oil. This is fundamental. And it would be a huge help if Russia could be stripped of its oil revenues. But it&#x2019;s not the only element that can help Ukraine win. The Kyiv Independent: Does it mean that the countries talking about stopping Russia from getting revenues from oil just can&apos;t keep up with the methods that it finds to go around the sanctions, or are they not very resolute in employing the sanctions that will actually make a difference? Dmytro Kuleba: I think so far, oil-related measures were half-measures. They couldn&#x2019;t deprive Russia of its access to oil revenues. And the reason for that is what one could call global energy stability and the balance of power among oil exporters and regulators.

(Andrey Rudakov/ Bloomberg via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Western partners believe that if they give Ukraine a lot of weapons, they will cross Russian &#x201C;red lines,&#x201D; and Russia will do something terrible. This is why they are stalling on providing Ukraine with enough military aid. Is this a real thing, Russian red lines? Dmytro Kuleba: Every conversation we had with our partners on weapons started with a &#x201C;no.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&apos;s an escalation. It&apos;s not what you need. It&apos;s too complicated. It&apos;s going to take too much time.&#x201D; We turned every &#x201C;no&#x201D; into &#x201C;yes&#x201D; and unlocked these options &#x2014; tanks, Patriots, howitzers, fighting jets. But we still hear the argument of non-escalation. Non-escalation is a very politicized term. When you have a country with nuclear power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which attacks its neighbor with a clear goal of destroying it to the ground &#x2014; this is called escalation. But everything the country that defends itself does to exercise its right to self-defense cannot be considered as escalation per se. This country is fighting for its life and survival. So when anyone says that Ukraine cannot do this or that, because it will be an escalation, they basically invite Russia to finish Ukraine off. All the nice words &#x2014; calls for peace, not feeding to the war, not escalating &#x2014; when it applies to helping Ukraine, this is an invitation for Russia to continue destroying Ukraine. Second, the escalation argument is flawed for another simple reason: We see that Russia keeps escalating at any cost. Russia brought North Korean troops to the front line because it lacked its own resources, not in response to Ukraine&#x2019;s actions or to the actions of its partners. Russia is destroying our energy system and our civilian infrastructure not because Ukraine is escalating, but because Russia is committed to achieving its goals. So it&apos;s hypocritical for our key partners to think of helping Ukraine in terms of avoiding escalation. The Kyiv Independent: Why should Trump support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO? Dmytro Kuleba: Because it&apos;s the only way to prevent the next war. From a short-term perspective, you can reach a ceasefire without Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO. But a ceasefire is not the end of the war. Once you bargain membership in NATO for a ceasefire, you lose the opportunity to end the war. NATO is the only way to end the war conclusively and prevent future wars for two reasons. First, whatever we know of Putin, he will attack NATO only if he defeats Ukraine. If Ukraine comes out of this fight as a winning power and joins NATO, the combined military force of the alliance against Russia will be invincible. Second, in the prospect of maybe 10 years or so, I anticipate the emergence of revenge-driven political forces in Ukraine. It may sound counterintuitive, but the only way to prevent Ukraine from waging a war on Russia will be to have it in NATO, to make it bound by legal obligations of not exposing its allies to the risk of war with Russia. The Kyiv Independent: Does it mean that some Ukrainian territories stay occupied as a result of the deal to end the war? Dmytro Kuleba: No one can tell you now what the parameters of the deal will be. History has many cases when both territories had been occupied for decades and then liberated by their motherland power, like Alsace in France. There are other cases as well. One of the most popular references in Washington these days is the Korean example. Those who lean more towards Ukraine prefer to bring up the West and East Germany example. So there are plenty of cases in the world that you can learn from when it comes to territorial control. If a nation remains resolved and committed to the goal of restoring its territorial integrity, it doesn&apos;t matter how many years it will take. It&#x2019;s also a possibility that a nation learns over time how to live without these territories. And we don&apos;t know in which direction Ukrainian society will follow. The Kyiv Independent: Is Ukrainian society divided on how it sees victory in war? Dmytro Kuleba: Quite to the contrary, it&apos;s united. It set the bar very high. They want the victory that will consist of reaching the borders of 1991. But we are not having any conversation in our society on what other ways of winning are. Is temporary compromise acceptable at all? Or we are going to fight for every square meter of our land, whatever it takes? No one is talking about what could be temporary solutions on the way to the ultimate goal. Society is kind of telling the government, &#x201C;Now you are in charge of it, you show us what you achieved, and then we will decide whether to punish you or to praise you.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent: What do you think should be the ultimate goal for Ukrainian society? Dmytro Kuleba: If we ever accept in our heads and hearts, in our minds and hearts, the idea that we abandon these lands, the currently occupied territories, this will be the beginning of the end of Ukrainian statehood. Because if you draw a line here, Russia will immediately point out: then why don&apos;t we draw it 100 kilometers further? Even today Russia claims that they want full territories of Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts. Now imagine you even engage in a conversation with them about where a temporary line could be drawn. For our partners it&apos;s an easy exercise, this is how history works. There is always a shining bright general coming from the West who comes to the land of war, takes the map, draws a red line and says, &#x201C;Be it so.&#x201D; &quot;The Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine,&quot; a memorial for Ukrainian soldiers, in downtown Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2024.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Our own land was divided this way after World War I and we clearly remember it. So it&apos;s easy for them to draw these lines, but for us as a nation, this is a swim-or-sink moment. But it doesn&apos;t mean that there can be temporary solutions on the way to restoring territorial integrity. As I said, what we have to ensure is that the idea of recovering these territories should be part of our national identity and national idea. The Kyiv Independent: But on the way there, can Ukraine find itself in a situation where it&apos;s decided for us what the temporary solution is to end the war? Dmytro Kuleba: I don&apos;t think so. I hold the position that no one can send Ukraine down the drain except the Ukrainians themselves. No decision can be imposed on Ukraine if we do not agree that it is imposed on us. When we look at Ukraine from the perspective of today&apos;s headlines in the news and social media, we seem weak, bleeding and exhausted. But when we zoom out, we inevitably come to a conclusion that today Ukraine is in the strongest position ever in its history. For the first time in hundreds of years, we have the state, the army, and the leadership. With all discussions taking place in the media and on the streets, we have national unity and clear national and political identities. For the first time, we are united in our attitude towards Russia. And finally, we have partners. We can complain a hundred times about what they&apos;ve done wrong, but they&apos;ve done a lot for us. And this is the first time in history that we have partners who actually stand by us despite all of their shortcomings. So in this generation, we have no right to lose this struggle, because we are today in the strongest position possible compared to all the preceding generations of Ukrainians who had fought and lost, unfortunately. We should not repeat their mistakes. And we have all the conditions for that. We don&#x2019;t have the right not to succeed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-today-is-in-the-strongest-position-ever-ex-foreign-minister-kuleba-says/	2025-01-02T03:20:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1934971638.jpg
Ukraine’s electricity imports increased more than fivefold in 2024	Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity import increased more than fivefold in 2024 to 4.4 million megawatt-hours (MWh), ExPro consulting company&#x2019;s electricity monitoring data showed on Jan. 2. Russia has been carrying out massive campaigns of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since late 2022. The damages have caused serious energy deficits and necessitated the introduction of rolling blackouts across the country, sometimes lasting 20 hours. Russia also occupies Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The peak of imports this year occurred in June, when Ukraine received more than 850,000 MWh. Over the last year, Hungary accounted for 39% of the imports, followed by Slovakia with 23% and Romania at 18%, and Poland &#x2013; 14%, data showed. Ukraine became a net importer of electricity, exporting only 366,000 MWh in 2024. Russia also targeted substations vital for the operation of the three remaining Ukraine-run nuclear power plants: Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and South Ukraine, intensifying the strain on the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants, which supply two-thirds of its electricity. Experts warn that disrupting power to these facilities could lead to severe safety risks. The International Monetary Fund estimated the damage to Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid as a result of Russian attacks to cumulate as high as $56.5 billion by mid-2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-electricity-imports-increased-more-than-fivefold-in-2024/	2025-01-02T02:31:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg
European gas prices rise after Russian gas transit through Ukraine halts	European gas prices rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros on the first trading day after Ukraine stopped transiting Russia&#x2019;s natural gas to central-Europe, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 2. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1, having repeatedly warned it would not extend the agreement when it expired at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. The rise in gas prices to 51 euros per megawatt-hour is the highest since October 2023, and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe. Experts told Bloomberg that the halt in supply will be remedied by tapping stored reserves this winter, but higher demand is expected for natural gas to refill inventories over the course of 2025. Liquified natural gas (LNG) can only partially replace Russian natural gas flows due to the lack of infrastructure for its transport and its higher price. Stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine is &quot;one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 1 on his Telegram channel. &quot;When Putin was handed power in Russia over 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through Ukraine to Europe stood at over 130 billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Turning energy into a weapon and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of its most attractive and geographically accessible market.&quot; According to Zelensky, most European countries &quot;have adapted&quot; to the termination of Russian gas transit. Zelensky added that the allies&apos; common task now is to support Moldova, dependent on Russian supplies, in its energy transformation. Zelensky said he believes that U.S. gas supplies and other partners will make energy market prices more favorable.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-gas-prices-rise-after-russian-gas-transit-through-ukraine-halts/	2025-01-02T02:07:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure at least 6, kill 4 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded six and killed four people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 2. Two civilians were killed and six were injured in Kherson Oblast following Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, high-rise buildings, and houses in over 38 of the oblast&#x2019;s settlements, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A Russian attack overnight killed a civilian in the town of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel on Jan. 2. One person was killed in the city of Mirnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel.

Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 47 drones over 12 oblasts, and forced an additional 24 drone-imitations to veer off course without casualties, the Air Force said. One drone was in the air at the time of the publication of the Air Force&#x2019;s report. Civilian infrastructure, buildings and a car were damaged as a result of Russian attacks in Kharkiv Oblast, but there were no civilian injuries, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-wound-at-least-6-kill-4-over-past-day/	2025-01-02T00:08:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1244779094.jpeg
Russian strike kills civilian in Zaporizhzhia Oblast	A Russian attack overnight killed a civilian in the town of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel on Jan. 2. The victim&#x2019;s body was found under the rubble of a five-story building after a more than five-hours-long search and rescue operation, the governor said, adding that the village of Stepnohirsk was hit 11 times by glide bombs during the attack. Russia has not slowed down its attacks on Ukraine over the holiday period, attacking Kyiv on the first day of 2025 with drones, killing two prominent scientists and injuring six others, including two pregnant women. The attack on the city of Kyiv also damaged the building of the National Bank of Ukraine. Russia conducted a large-scale Christmas attack on Dec. 25, firing 78 missiles and 106 drones against multiple cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-kills-civilian-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2025-01-01T23:08:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-02-16_04_10.jpg

Ukraine's Navy says it destroyed over 37,000 Russian drones in 2024	Ukrainian naval units destroyed over 37,000 Russian drones in the year 2024, the Navy reported on Jan. 1. This includes Russian strike drones, operational and tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), first-person-view (FPV) drones, strike UAVs, and Shahed-type attack drones, the Navy said in a Facebook post. Ukrainian naval forces also destroyed five Russian ships and 458 watercraft. Russia&apos;s UAV losses included 35,670 destroyed FPV drones and 1,140 strike drones, the Navy said. Ukrainian units also eliminated 192 operational and tactical drones and another 164 Shahed-136/131 drones. Russian drone attacks across Ukraine surged to record levels in the last months of 2024, with Moscow aiming to ramp up UAV production in the new year. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. Ukrainian forces in turn have targeted Russian military facilites and equipment, both within Russia and in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. A Ukrainian-made Magura V5 naval strike drone on Dec. 31 destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter for the first time. According to Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces suffered high losses in 2024. Around 427,000 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded last year, he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-navy-says-it-destroyed-over-37-000-russian-drones-in-2024/	2025-01-01T18:04:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1635611552.jpg
Prominent scientists among victims of New Year's Day drone attack in Kyiv	The two victims killed in Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 drone strike on Kyiv were a married couple who both worked as scientists, Education and Science Minister Oksen Lisovyi announced. Prominent neurobiologist Ihor Zyma and doctor of biological sciences Olesia Sokur were killed in the attack, Lisovyi said on Facebook. Zyma and Sokur were married. &quot;The family devoted almost their entire lives to science,&quot; Lisovyi said. Zyma was a senior researcher and associate professor at the Institute for Biology and Medicine at the Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Sokur also worked at the Institute as a deputy director of scientific work and a member of the Academic Council. &quot;My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased, as well as to all who suffered from today&apos;s morning terror,&quot; Lisovyi said. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people and injuring six others, including two pregnant women. The attack also damaged a building of the National Bank of Ukraine. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion has taken a severe toll on Ukraine&apos;s scientific community. According to a study published by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) on Dec. 11, 23.5 percent of scientists still living in Ukraine have lost access to critical input for their research, and 20.8 percent cannot physically access their institution. Around 18% of Ukraine&apos;s scientists have fled the country amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/prominent-scientists-among-victims-of-new-years-day-drone-attack-in-kyiv/	2025-01-01T15:04:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/drone-strike.jpeg
Putin orders Russian government, top bank to cooperate with China on AI tech	Russian President Vladimir Putin has directed the Russian government and the state-owned bank Sberbank to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology partnerships with China, according to instructions published on the Kremlin web portal on Jan. 1. Moscow&apos;s alliance with Beijing has helped Russia gain access to technology and equipment that have been blocked by Western sanctions due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin told the government and Sberbank to &quot;ensure further cooperation with the People&apos;s Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.&quot; Sberbank has been tasked with leading Russia&apos;s AI development effort. International sanctions have limited Russia&apos;s ability to develop its AI industry. Major producers of microchips no longer ship to Russia due to restrictions, though the country still obtains products via third-party sellers in other countries. Graphics processing units (GPUs), microchips essential for AI development, have been difficult for Russia to replace, Sberbank CEO German Gref said in 2023. Putin said on Dec. 11 that he wanted to develop a new AI Alliance Network with members of BRICS and other interested countries. Sberbank claimed that AI associations from Brazil, China, India, and South Africa had already joined the network. BRICS is a bloc of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged New Year greetings with Putin on Dec. 31, saying &quot;the political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have continuously marched to a higher level under the strategic guidance of the two leaders.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-russian-government-top-bank-to-cooperate-with-china-on-ai-tech/	2025-01-01T14:12:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187508552.jpg
Zelensky offers condolences after deadly New Orleans truck attack	President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his condolences to the families of the victims of a deadly vehicle attack in the U.S. city of New Orleans on New Year&apos;s Day. A truck driver in New Orleans intentionally rammed into a crowd on Jan. 1, killing at least 10 people and injuring 30. U.S. authorities are investigating the incident as a possible terrorist attack. &quot;Horrified by the attack in New Orleans, U.S., which has claimed innocent lives and left many injured,&quot; Zelensky wrote in a post on X. &quot;We trust that those responsible for this terrible act will be brought to justice. Violence, terrorism, and any threats to human life have no place in our world and must not be tolerated.&quot; The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it had identified a suspect, a 42-year-old military veteran from Texas. The man was killed in a firefight with law enforcement officers. The FBI said they do not believe the driver was solely responsible for the attack. &quot;Our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and we wish a swift recovery to all those injured,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine stands with the American people and denounces violence.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments came after Ukraine withstood its own barrage of New Year attacks. Russia launched over 100 drones at Ukraine on Jan. 1, killing two people in the capital city of Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-offers-condolences-after-deadly-new-orleans-truck-attack/	2025-01-01T13:21:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-8_13_53-PM.jpeg
Hungary loses out on about $1 billion in EU aid	Hungary will not receive 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in aid from the European Union due to violations of the rule of law, the German news agency DPA reported on Dec. 31, citing a European Commission spokesperson. The aid package was conditional on Hungary implementing reforms to bring the country into compliance with EU standards by the end of 2024. These included changes to laws on preventing conflicts of interest and fighting corruption. Budapest failed to meet the requirements, and thus lost funding, according to the European Commission. This was the EU&apos;s first such action against a bloc member. In 2022, the EU initiated a &quot;conditionality&quot; procedure against Hungary, seeking to block payments due to alleged violations of public procurement rules. EU accused the Hungarian government of &quot;lack of control and transparency.&quot; According to EU assessments, Budapest was found to be neglecting the bloc&apos;s standards and fundamental values. Hungary agreed to implement reforms to unblock some funds, but 19 billion euros ($20 billion) remained frozen. In July, the European Commission said that Hungary did not meet EU democratic standards, particularly those regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. According to the EU regulation on aid conditions, the &quot;first tranche of suspended obligations&quot; of 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) would expire at the end of 2024 without lifting the suspension. Hungary, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-proximate EU member, has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine on account that it &quot;prolongs&quot; and &quot;escalates&quot; the ongoing war. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on an extension of the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing undisclosed sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-loses-out-on-about-1-billion-in-eu-aid/	2025-01-01T12:35:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190744266.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia attacks Kyiv on first day of 2025, killing 2, injuring 6	Key developments on Jan. 1: Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people, the Kyiv city military administration said on Telegram, citing its head Tymur Tkachenko. At least six people were injured in the attack, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service said. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Telegram that the injured included two pregnant women. The National Bank of Ukraine said that one of its buildings in Kyiv&apos;s Pechersk District had been damaged by falling debris. The central bank&apos;s main building is located near the President&apos;s Office on Bankova Street. &quot;All the NBU&apos;s (National Bank of Ukraine) operating systems and services are fully operational and unaffected,&quot; the Central Bank said in a statement posted on Facebook, adding that windows on the upper floors were damaged. The aftermath of the Russian drone attack against the center of Ukraine&apos;s capital, Kyiv, on Jan. 1, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service)Russia launched 111 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed ones, against Ukraine overnight on Jan. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on its Telegram channel. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 63 drones over 10 oblasts, while another 46 drones did not reach their targets, the Air Force said. &quot;Even on New Year&apos;s Eve, Russia was only concerned with hurting Ukraine,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement posted on his Telegram channel on Jan. 1. &quot;My condolences to the families and friends (of the victims).&quot; He also thanked the army, doctors, and emergency services for their work. Russia has not slowed down its attacks on Ukraine over the holiday period. On Dec. 25, Russia conducted a large-scale Christmas attack, firing 78 missiles and 106 drones against multiple cities. The Russian army has lost over 38,000 troops and more than 1,000 pieces of equipment since the beginning of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 1. Syrskyi&apos;s statement comes after his visit to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to reward the Ukrainian military serving in the area. Over 700 servicemen from the Russian military were captured during the Ukrainian incursion, the general added. &quot;We will continue to destroy the invaders. It doesn&apos;t matter whether they have Russian or North Korean passports. The battle continues,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, capturing about 1,300 square kilometers of territory, according to Kyiv. Ukrainian forces have lost control of about half of the initially captured territory as intense fighting continues in the region. Kyiv hopes to use the occupied Russian territory as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Russia has also stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their lack of knowledge of the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. In 2024, more Ukrainians were freed from Russian captivity than in the previous year, according to data published by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs). Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 1,358 people, 356 more than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 3,956 &#xA0;prisoners have been released from Russian captivity. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the numbers in his New Year video address published late on Dec. 31. &quot;I&apos;m giving not estimates but precise numbers because each one represents a person, our person, a very important person,&quot; he said. &quot;And with each return &#x2013; we bring life back to Ukraine.&quot; On Dec. 30, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 189 captives from Russian detention, including military personnel and two civilians. The coordination headquarters said it was one of the largest exchanges since the start of the full-scale war. Among those freed were defenders of Azovstal, Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Snake Island, and other key Ukrainian strongholds. Among the released were 87 Armed Forces members, 43 National Guard members, 33 border guards, 24 sailors, and fighters from the Azov Regiment. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his New Year video address late on Dec. 31 that no one would give peace to his country as a gift, but he believed the U.S. &#xA0;would stand together with Ukraine as it fights to stop Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In a 20-minute address, Zelensky thanked the U.S. for providing a wide array of critical military equipment, including 39 multiple-launch rocket systems, 301 Howitzer artillery weapons, and over 300 million units of ammunition. Zelensky added that he has &quot;no doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending Putin&apos;s aggression.&quot; &quot;(President-elect Donald Trump) understands that the first is impossible without the second. Because this is not a street fight where you have to calm down both sides. This is the full-scale aggression of a mad state against a civilized one,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And I believe that we, together with the U.S., are capable of exerting that force.&quot; Zelensky also recalled conversations with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, and &quot;everyone who supports us in the U.S.&quot; The Biden administration has provided the most substantial military support to Ukraine among Western nations since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. As of December 2024, the U.S. had committed over $60 billion in military aid and $26 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine, dwarfing the contributions of other major donors such as Germany ($11.4 billion) and the U.K. ($10.1 billion).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-attacks-ukraines-capital-on-first-day-of-2025-killing-2-injuring-6/	2025-01-01T11:52:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-01-20_34_45.jpeg
Moldova to import electricity from Romania, Ukraine as Russia halts gas supply	Moldova&apos;s state-owned energy company Energocom will import electricity from Romania and Ukraine to cover the shortfall caused by Russia&apos;s halt of gas supplies, NewsMaker media outlet reported on Jan. 1. Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, allegedly because of the debt of the Moldovagaz gas transportation company. The halt of gas supplies resulted in a heating outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, prompting Chisinau to seek alternative sources of electricity. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, some countries, including Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary, have remained reliant on Russian gas. Most of Moldova&apos;s electricity needs, 62%, will be covered by imports from Romania, which Chisinau will start receiving in January. About 30% will be covered by thermal power plants and local renewable energy producers, according to NewsMaker.Moldova will also import electricity from Ukraine. Energocom told the media it would import electricity from Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy operator, Energoatom, at night when consumption is lower and there is a surplus of resources. In mid-December, a state of emergency was declared in Moldova, partly due to uncertainty over further Russian gas supplies in 2025. The Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom has supplied 5.7 million cubic meters of gas to Moldova since the end of 2022. The entire volume of gas was sent to the Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, where it was used for domestic needs and to generate electricity at the Moldovan hydroelectric power plant, which powered both banks of the Dnister River. Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, allegedly because of the debt of the Moldovagaz, which was not confirmed by an international audit, according to NewsMaker. In response to Moscow&apos;s decision, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused the Kremlin of using energy as a &quot;political weapon.&quot; In a separate move on Jan. 1, Ukraine terminated the transit of Russian gas through Ukrainian territory. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the transit agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. &#xA0; President Volodymyr Zelensky called the termination of gas transfer &quot;one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats&quot; on Jan. 1. Zelensky added that one of the main European allies&apos; current tasks is to support Moldova in its energy transformation. &quot;The more gas from Europe&apos;s true partners is available on the market, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,&quot; Zelensky said. Moldova, one of Europe&apos;s poorest countries, lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 heightened Moldova&apos;s security concerns, with drone fragments landing on its territory and missiles targeting Ukraine passing through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, re-elected last month, albeit with a narrower margin than expected, accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-export-electricity-to-moldova-overnight-on-jan-2/	2025-01-01T11:34:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg
One of Moscow's biggest defeats' — Zelensky on stopping Russian gas transit via Ukraine	Stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine is &quot;one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 1 on his Telegram channel. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. &quot;When Putin was handed power in Russia over 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through Ukraine to Europe stood at over 130 billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Turning energy into a weapon and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of its most attractive and geographically accessible market.&quot; According to Zelensky, most European countries &quot;have adapted&quot; to the termination of Russian gas transit. Zelensky added that the allies&apos; common task now is to support Moldova, dependent on Russian supplies, in its energy transformation. Zelensky said he believes that U.S. gas supplies and other partners will make energy market prices more favorable. &quot;The more gas from Europe&apos;s true partners is available on the market, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,&quot; Zelensky said. He added that it will also be necessary &quot;to withstand the hysteria of some European politicians who prefer mafia schemes with Moscow to transparent energy policy.&quot; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meet with him, and promote pro-Russian narratives in Europe. In his New Year&apos;s address, Fico said that stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine would have &quot;radical consequences&quot; for everyone in the European Union, but not for Russia. Fico &#xA0;claimed that gas and electricity prices in Europe would rise. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional 220 million euro ($228.73 million) in transit fees.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-of-moscows-biggest-defeats-zelensky-on-stopping-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-01T09:35:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190054860.jpg
Poland assumes presidency of EU Council, calls security 'top priority'	Poland has assumed its six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union on Jan. 1. Poland takes over the presidency from Hungary, one of Russia&apos;s closest allies in Europe, which has repeatedly blocked EU aid to Ukraine. Hungarian presidency was boycotted in protest of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s foreign policy, which is at odds with the EU. &quot;This presidency will be groundbreaking in many ways. It begins during a challenging time marked by conflicts, and our task will be to convince all 27 EU member states that Europe can continue to be the safest, most stable place on Earth,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, adding that security will be &quot;a top priority&quot; during the upcoming six months. Tusk said that Warsaw would continue to aid Kyiv, adding that the EU must also strive to strengthen its borders and counter the instrumentalization of migration. &quot;We will do everything to ensure that Europe&apos;s security is a reality, not just an aspiration. I hope Poland will lead efforts that result in peace,&quot; Tusk said. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X that Ukraine relies on &quot;Polish leadership, principled stance, and determination.&quot; Sybiha expressed hope for new initiatives to provide military assistance to Ukraine and for a swift EU accession process. &quot;We aim for a dynamic process of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession, including the opening of Cluster 1 and other clusters based on the results of the screening process,&quot; the minister added. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky previously said that the 2025 presidency of Poland and Denmark, some of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, will be &quot;historic for Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky added that in 2025, Ukraine would do its best in EU access negotiations and the development of relations with EU partners. The president also hopes that in 2025, Ukraine will open at least two clusters in the EU accession talks. Two EU accession clusters for Ukraine are expected to open during the first half of 2025 under Poland&apos;s presidency of the EU Council, a high-ranking EU official told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. The EU&apos;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June 2022, with the European Council approving the launch of accession talks in December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-assumes-presidency-of-eu-council/	2025-01-01T08:33:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1898123885.jpg
Russia has lost over 38,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	The Russian army has lost over 38,000 troops and more than 1,000 pieces of equipment since the beginning of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 1.

Ukraine becomes party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court	Ukraine has officially become the 125th state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Jan. 1. A Ukrainian flag was set up among the flags of other state parties at the ICC in the Hague, Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform reported on Jan. 1. &quot;This means that it (Ukraine) is now a full-fledged state party to this international treaty and has all the rights and obligations assigned to state parties,&quot; ICC spokesperson Fadi el-Abdallah told Ukrinform. The Ukrainian parliament ratified the Roman Statute in August 2024, 24 years since Kyiv first signed it. Ratification is a necessary step for an international agreement to hold sway over a sovereign country&#x2019;s actions and citizens in specified areas. The Roman Statute is the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court, granting it jurisdiction over four crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Ukraine ratified the statute with a caveat that it would not recognize the court&apos;s jurisdiction over Ukrainian citizens in the case of war crimes for seven years following its official adoption. With Ukraine joining, 125 states have ratified the statute. Russia and the U.S. signed the treaty but later withdrew their signatures. As a member of the ICC from 2025, Ukraine will have all the rights and obligations assigned to state parties. &#x201C;The most important of these is the right to vote when approving the budget, adopting changes and amendments to the Rome Statute, and selecting judges, the future prosecutor and his deputies, which to some extent helps shape the future of international criminal law,&#x201D; ICC spokesperson told Ukrinform. In March 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for the forced deportations of at least tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-occupied territories. The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council who formerly served as defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for war crimes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-becomes-party-to-the-rome-statute-of-the-international-criminal-court/	2025-01-01T07:43:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/ICC.jpg
Ukraine stops Russian gas transit via its territory	Ukraine stopped Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1, the Operator of Ukraine&apos;s Gas Transmission System said in a statement posted on Facebook. &#x201C;Starting from Jan. 1, Ukraine&apos;s gas transportation system is operating without Russian gas transit,&#x201D; the statement read. Russia has been paying Ukraine to carry its gas through Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 deal between the two countries. Ukraine has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. As the contract expired, the last entry point of Russian gas to Ukraine in the Ukrainian-held border town of Sudzha in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast stopped working. &#x201C;Accordingly, the transportation of natural gas from the Sudzha entry point on the eastern border of Ukraine to the exit points on the western and southern borders was stopped,&#x201D; the gas operator said. As a consequence of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war and Ukraine&#x2019;s repeated warnings to halt Russia&#x2019;s gas transit, many European countries have sharply decreased their use of Russian gas. But landlocked Central European countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, still rely on Russian gas. To force Kyiv to change its mind, Slovakia threatened to cut electricity supplies to Ukraine on Dec. 28 if Kyiv went through with its promise to halt Russian gas transit. Later Poland signified its willingness to step in should Slovakia follow through on its promises. &#x201C;The cessation of transit will have serious consequences for all of us in the European Union, but not for the Russian Federation,&#x201D; Slovakia&#x2019;s Prime Minister Robert Fico said during his New Year&apos;s Day address. After Russian gas transit was halted, a major gas outage began in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which imports gas via Ukrainian territory, its gas supplier Tiraspoltransgaz-Pridnestrovie reported on its Telegram channel on Jan. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-gas-transit-through-ukraine-stop-as-2025-begins/	2025-01-01T06:21:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg

US sanctions Russian, Iranian groups for election disinformation campaigns	The United States has sanctioned two entities accused of advancing Iranian and Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at influencing American voters before this year&#x2019;s election, according to the Treasury Department. Treasury officials announced on Dec. 31 that these groups sought to deepen divisions among Americans ahead of November&#x2019;s vote. U.S. intelligence agencies have identified both governments as responsible for spreading disinformation, including fake news stories, videos, and social media posts, to manipulate voters and erode confidence in U.S. elections. &quot;The governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,&quot; said Bradley T. Smith, Treasury&#x2019;s acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. Authorities identified the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise as a key player in creating, funding, and distributing disinformation about American candidates, including AI-generated deepfake videos. The sanctions also target the center&#x2019;s director, who allegedly collaborated with Russian military intelligence agents responsible for cyberattacks and sabotage against Western nations. The center reportedly used artificial intelligence to generate fake videos and developed numerous fake news websites designed to appear legitimate. It also paid U.S. companies to host pro-Russian content. The Iranian group, the Cognitive Design Production Center, is linked to Iran&#x2019;s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. designates as a foreign terrorist organization. Officials claim the center has been inciting political tensions in the U.S. since at least 2023, including encouraging protests over Israel&#x2019;s war with Hamas in Gaza. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Iran of hacking into the accounts of high-profile current and former U.S. officials, including senior figures from Donald Trump&#x2019;s campaign. Ahead of the election, intelligence agencies also identified efforts by Russia, Iran, and China to undermine trust in U.S. democracy.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-iranian-groups-for-election-disinformation-campaigns/	2024-12-31T18:38:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1601789399.jpg

4 Ukrainian children return home from Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully returned four children from the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast thanks to the &quot;Bring Kids Back UA&quot; initiative as well as &quot;Save Ukraine,&quot; Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin announced on Dec. 31. These include two boys and two girls, aged between 3 and 17. &quot;A true New Year&apos;s miracle!&quot; Prokudin said in his statement, adding that &quot;each of them has endured experiences no child should ever face: Russian terror, threats, and interrogations of their relatives.&quot; Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Since the beginning of 2024, at least 246 children native to Kherson Oblast have been returned from Russian occupation, Prokudin said. A Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3 detailed Russia&apos;s systematic program of deporting and forcibly assimilating Ukrainian children. Under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, children were transported via military aircraft in 2022, reclassified in Russian databases as native-born, and subjected to pro-Russian re-education before being adopted into Russian families. Ukrainian children had been transported to at least 21 regions throughout Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-ukrainian-children-return-home-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2024-12-31T13:31:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178506540.jpg
2024 was 'hard-won and free,' Zelensky says in New Year's Eve message	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 31 said 2024 was &quot;another step towards justice, a fair peace, our victory, and a life without war,&quot; in a post on social media to mark New Year&apos;s Eve. &quot;Every single day of it has been won by our warriors, by all our people, by everyone who defends, works, strengthens, and helps,&quot; he said. &quot;We Ukrainians know what it means not to wait for what tomorrow will bring, but to fight for every single day, and every year of freedom. And 2024 was exactly that &#x2014; a year hard-won and free,&quot; he added. Our 2024. Every single day of it has been won by our warriors, by all our people, by everyone who defends, works, strengthens, and helps.Hard work and courage, humanity and integrity of the entire nation filled this year. Along with care, development and love, the desire to&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/uL3Tq3Gb13 Ukraine has faced a particularly tough year on the battlefield. The entire year saw Ukrainian troops on the back foot, losing territory to the advancing Russian troops in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast and eastern Donetsk Oblast. Russia captured Avdiivka &#x2014; an industrial city in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; in February, kickstarting Moscow&apos;s offensives all across the region. Taking advantage of a poorly conducted rotation of Ukrainian units, Russian troops launched a push toward Toretsk and Niu-York, towns in the mid-part of Donetsk Oblast that used to enjoy little engagement. Russia continued to gain ground on the eastern part of the region over the summer, gradually approaching Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, and Vuhledar. Vuhledar was captured in October. Experts say that Russia could capture Pokrovsk within &quot;months.&quot; As well as further challenges on the battlefield, 2025 will also bring with it U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump&#x2019;s previous criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine and his intent to &#x201C;get out&#x201D; of the war has sparked concerns that his approach may involve pressuring Kyiv into concessions to achieve a settlement. Zelensky&apos;s full post reads: Our 2024. Every single day of it has been won by our warriors, by all our people, by everyone who defends, works, strengthens, and helps. Hard work and courage, humanity and integrity of the entire nation filled this year. Along with care, development and love, the desire to change reality for the better, no matter what. We Ukrainians know what it means not to wait for what tomorrow will bring, but to fight for every single day and every year of freedom. And 2024 was exactly that &#x2014; a year hard-won and free.

Fico's threats to cut off electricity supplies won't work, Ukraine's Energy Minister says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s threats to cut off electricity supplies to Kyiv won&apos;t work, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said in a Dec. 31 interview with Politico. Halushchenko&apos;s statement follows Fico&apos;s declaration on Dec. 27 that his government would consider halting electricity supplies to Ukraine, after Kyiv announced it would not extend the deal on transit of Russian gas to Europe beyond Dec. 31. Halushchenko said that Ukraine could compensate for any disruption by importing electricity from Romania and Poland, and that Fico&apos;s potential actions would &quot;violate EU regulations.&quot; The statement echoed President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s remarks on Dec. 21, in which he directly addressed Fico&apos;s threats. &quot;Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or instructions from Moscow to Fico regarding electricity will not lead to a halt in electricity imports to Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said, adding: &quot;Slovakia is part of the unified European energy market, and Fico must abide by pan-European regulations.&quot; Halushchenko also said that cutting off electricity supplies would primarily harm Slovakia&apos;s own economy. &quot;This is not about receiving subsidies or free electricity. We pay for the electricity we receive,&quot; he said, estimating that halting exports could cost Slovakia &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; annually. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry echoed these sentiments in a Dec. 28 press briefing, stressing that &quot;Slovakia&apos;s supply of critical amounts of electricity to Ukraine is not charity: Ukraine pays Slovakia a significant amount for it.&quot; The ministry also criticized Fico&#x2019;s rhetoric, saying: &quot;By making senseless threats to cut off Ukraine&apos;s electricity, which it buys and does not receive as a gift, Prime Minister Robert Fico is effectively aligning himself with the Russian dictator.&quot; Fico held talks with Putin on Dec. 22 during a visit to Moscow, during which they discussed gas transit, the war in Ukraine and the standardization of &quot;mutual relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakias-ficos-threats-to-cut-off-gas-supply-wont-harm-ukraine-energy-minister-says/	2024-12-31T09:56:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Ukraine war latest: In world first, Ukrainian sea drone downs Russian helicopter	Key developments on Dec. 31: Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) destroyed a Russian aerial target with the Ukrainian-made Magura V5 naval strike drone for the first time, HUR reported on Dec. 31. During a battle in the Black Sea off the Western tip of occupied Crimea, the special unit Group 13 launched SeeDragon missiles from the Magura drone. The unit downed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter and hit another helicopter, although the latter was able to fly back to the airbase.A video from the battle shows the moment the missiles locked onto the helicopter before it exploded and crashed into the sea.The Magura drone has helped Ukraine push back against Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet by striking dozens of ships this year. They have been in operation since the summer of 2023.It can cover a distance of more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), reach a speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), and is capable of carrying a 250-kilogram warhead. Each one is 5.5 meters long and costs approximately 10 million hryvnias ($240,000).In June, HUR announced that the drones had been modified to operate anti-aircraft missiles, presenting a serious threat to the Russian air force over the Black Sea.Ukraine previously destroyed several notable Russian ships with Magura drones, including a landing ship Caesar Kunikov, a Sergei Kotov patrol ship, high-speed Serna and Akula landing crafts, and a Tarantul-class Ivanovets missile corvette. Russian missile and drone attacks injured at least one person and damaged residential buildings and infrastructure in Kyiv and Sumy oblasts on Dec. 31.Russian troops launched 21 missiles, including six Iskander ballistic missiles and one Kinzhal aeroballistic missile, &#xA0;and 40 drones overnight on Dec. 30-31.A woman in Kyiv Oblast was concussed after falling debris damaged the roof of a house and smashed its windows, according to the regional military administration.In the capital, missile wreckage fell onto the roof of a home in the Darnitskyi district. No casualties or damages were reported.Russian attacks also damaged infrastructure in the town of Shostka, Sumy Oblast, according to local government head Mykola Noha. While no fatalities have been recorded so far, the strikes damaged 12 residential buildings, two educational institutions, three boiler houses, a healthcare clinic, a dormitory, as well as other facilities.The damages and losses are still being clarified, Noha said.During the mass attack, Ukraine downed six missiles and 16 drones, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. A further 24 drones were decoys that failed to reach their target. &#xA0;Russia has not slowed down its attacks on Ukraine over the festive period. President Volodymr Zelenksy said on Dec. 29 that Moscow had escalated its aerial assaults on Ukraine during the holiday season.On Dec. 25, Russia conducted a large-scale Christmas attack, firing 78 missiles and 106 drones against multiple cities. Ukraine struck an oil depot in the Yartsevo district of Russia&apos;s Smolensk Oblast, igniting the facility&apos;s oil reserves, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces confirmed on Dec. 31. The depot, which supplies the Russian military, was targeted in a coordinated operation involving Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces and the Unmanned Systems Forces. The strike resulted in &quot;powerful explosions, a fire, and heavy smoke&quot; at the site, according to the report. It did not specify which type of weapon was used in the attack. The confirmation follows reports from regional authorities detailing the damage caused by an overnight Ukrainian drone attack. Roman Zakharov, head of the Yartsevo district, had previously reported on his Telegram channel that a Ukrainian drone targeted the fuel depot and an energy facility, sparking fires. Russia developed offensive plans targeting civilian and military sites in Japan and South Korea in the event of a war with NATO, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 31, citing documents shown to the outlet by Western sources. The leaked plans, drawn up between 2008 and 2014 to train military officers for a potential conflict on Russia&apos;s eastern flank, are reportedly still considered &quot;relevant to Russian strategy&quot; today. The documents outline 160 potential targets, including civilian and military infrastructure such as roads, bridges, factories, and military installations in NATO-allied Japan and South Korea. The plans detailed how striking these targets could protect Russia&apos;s eastern flank in a broader conflict by disrupting the &quot;regrouping of troops in areas of operational purpose.&quot; Military targets identified in the plans include the central and regional command headquarters of the Japanese and South Korean armed forces, radar installations, air bases, and naval facilities. Civilian infrastructure targets include roads, bridges, and rail tunnels. Other key sites include fuel refineries, industrial facilities such as steelworks and chemical factories in Busan, South Korea, and 13 power plants, including a nuclear complex in Tokai, Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-in-world-first-ukrainian-sea-drone-downs-russian-helicopter/	2024-12-31T09:21:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-18_58_25.png
Ukraine strikes oil depot in Russia's Smolensk Oblast, General Staff confirms	Ukraine struck an oil depot in the Yartsevo district of Russia&apos;s Smolensk Oblast, igniting the facility&apos;s oil reserves, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces confirmed on Dec. 31.

Roman Zakharov, head of the Yartsevo district, had previously reported on his Telegram channel that a Ukrainian drone targeted the fuel depot and an energy facility, sparking fires. The attack is the latest in a series of strikes on Russian oil infrastructure. Another overnight drone strike on Dec. 22 targeted an oil depot near the city of Oryol in western Russia. Videos shared on social media captured large explosions, though the extent of the damage remained unclear. Just a week earlier, on Dec. 14, Ukrainian drones had struck the same oil depot in Oryol, causing several fires, which the General Staff confirmed to be one of Russia&apos;s largest oil product terminals. Similarly, on Dec. 11, Ukrainian forces targeted an oil-loading pipeline near the Russian city of Bryansk, setting it ablaze. Over the past year, Ukraine has escalated its drone strikes on Russia&apos;s oil industry, seeking to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to sustain its war efforts and supply its military operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-oil-depot-in-russias-smolensk-oblast-general-staff-confirms/	2024-12-31T08:27:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-31-at-18_22_35.png
Russian officers trained for attacks on Japan, South Korea in event of war with NATO, FT reports	Russia developed offensive plans targeting civilian and military sites in Japan and South Korea in the event of a war with NATO, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 31, citing documents shown to the outlet by Western sources. The leaked plans, drawn up between 2008 and 2014 to train military officers for a potential conflict on Russia&apos;s eastern flank, are reportedly still considered &quot;relevant to Russian strategy&quot; today.

Although the plans were drafted between 2008 and 2014, both Russia and NATO are now openly discussing the possibility of war. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, speaking at a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16, said Russia needed to prepare for various scenarios, including a &quot;potential conflict with NATO within the next decade.&quot; Belousov accused NATO of preparing for war, citing actions such as appointing a representative in Kyiv and supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership during the Alliance&apos;s 75th-anniversary summit in July 2024. On the Atlantic side, European NATO foreign ministers have begun discussing a gradual increase in the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% to 3% of GDP by 2030. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius in particular advocated for a larger defense budget, saying: &quot;If Putin attacks, we need to be able to wage war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officers-trained-for-attack-on-japan-south-korea-in-potential-nato-war-ft-reports/	2024-12-31T07:54:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
3 European leaders, Pope Francis receive New Year telegrams from Putin	The leaders of three European countries as well as Pope Francis received New Year telegrams from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said on Dec. 30. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were among those &quot;warmly congratulated&#x2026; on Christmas and the upcoming New Year 2025,&quot; Moscow said. While most European countries remain on frosty terms with Russia since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a handful have retained varying degrees of positive diplomatic relations. Orban has maintained close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, frequently criticizing EU sanctions on Russia and blocking military aid to Kyiv. Serbia has maintained friendly relations with Moscow, and is heavily reliant on Russian gas, consuming around 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas annually, of which Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom provides around 2 billion. Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions. At the same time, Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty, and his administration has given significant aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The Pope has earned a controversial reputation in Ukraine with remarks that relativized the responsibility of Russia&#x2019;s war, encouraging Ukrainians to have the &quot;courage&quot; to negotiate for peace. During Sunday prayer on Dec. 15, Pope Francis referred to Russia and Ukraine as &quot;brothers,&quot; while reiterating calls for peace in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &quot;They are brothers, cousins. Let them come to an understanding. War is always a defeat. Peace to the whole world,&quot; the pope said during a visit to the French island of Corsica. As a precursor to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin repeatedly framed its invasion as an effort to reunite the two nations as &quot;one people,&quot; relying on numerous false historical claims. In the lead-up to the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked biblical imagery, describing the two countries as a &quot;brotherhood&quot; and comparing their relationship to that of Cain and Abel.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-european-leaders-pope-francis-receive-new-year-telegrams-from-putin/	2024-12-31T07:14:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190864899.jpg
EU won't be impacted by end of Russian gas transit deal with Ukraine, Deutsche Welle reports	Europe will not feel much of an impact when Ukraine cuts gas transit from Russia on Jan. 1, Deutsche Welle reported on Dec. 30, citing a representative of the European Commission. The European Commission has been preparing alternative routes for over a year after Kyiv made it clear that it would not renew its contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom that ends on Jan. 1. &#xA0;European infrastructure allows for the flow of gas from other countries, the European Commission representative said. The EU has increased capacity for liquid natural gas (LNG) imports and its energy security has been bolstered by expanding renewable energy sources.&quot;The impact of the suspension of transit through Ukraine on ensuring the security of EU supplies is limited,&quot; she said. Ukraine and Russia signed the deal in 2019 and Moscow has since paid Kyiv roughly $800 million a year to transit its gas to Europe through the Druzhba pipeline, even during the full-scale invasion. However, Ukraine repeatedly emphasized that it will not renew the contract once it expires which will cause Gazprom to lose $5 billion in annual sales. On its final day, Gazprom said it would only send 37.2 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas through the pipeline instead of 42.4 mcm, which it supplied on Dec. 30, Reuters reported. While most EU countries have moved away from Russian energy, the end of the deal will most impact Slovakia. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies, and said on Dec. 27 that Bratislava would cut electricity supplies to Ukraine if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t renew the deal. Slovakia&#x2019;s neighbor and Russia&#x2019;s ally, Hungary, will continue to import Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline. Ukraine&#x2019;s Gas Transmission System Operator warned that Ukraine&#x2019;s gas transit infrastructure could come under Russian attacks following the end of the deal. &quot;We are taking all measures to ensure the security of our facilities,&quot; CEO Dmytro Lyppa said on Dec. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/dw-eu-wont-be-impacted-by-end-of-russian-gas-transit-deal-with-ukraine/	2024-12-31T07:04:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Ukrainians paid $24 billion in taxes in 2024, Finance Ministry reports	Ukrainian citizens and businesses paid over 1 trillion hryvnias ($24 billion) in tax in 2024, the Finance Ministry reported on Dec. 31. Corporate income tax amounted to Hr 270.8 billion ($6.5 billion), value added tax came to Hr 267.8 billion ($6.4 billion), personal income tax and military tax- a sum levied from citizens to support the war effort- was Hr 233.6 billion ($5.6 billion), excise tax was Hr 133.5 billion ($3.2 billion), and Hr 51.8 billion ($1.2 billion) was transferred to the state budget from rent. This comes a month after President Volodymyr Zelensky signed off on a major tax increase bill on Nov. 28 in a bid to plug Ukraine&#x2019;s budget deficit. The bill was expected to raise an additional Hr 8 billion ($190 million) this year and should bring in an extra Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) to the state budget next year, said lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak. In total, Ukraine&#x2019;s state budget received Hr 3.1 trillion ($74 billion), including Hr 600 billion ($14.3 billion) from the State Customs Service and Hr 453.6 billion ($10.8 billion) from international grants. Looking towards 2025, Ukraine is bracing for a $35 billion budget deficit, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in August. Foreign partners are expected to cover roughly $20 billion, while the tax reforms hope to pick up a chunk of the remaining $15 billion funding at home. The bill, which was delayed by more than a month, also increased military tax for citizens from 1.5% to 5% and made small businesses subject to the war tax. Banks, which are witnessing record profits, saw their profit taxes increase to 50% for 2024. Taxes for other financial institutions will increase from 18% to 25% in January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-pay-24-billion-in-taxes-in-2024/	2024-12-31T06:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2135546921.jpg

Zelensky dismisses Presidential Office deputy head	President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Presidential Office Deputy Head Roman Mashovets, the President&#x2019;s Office wrote on Dec. 30. Mashovets had been in the role since April 2020 under the Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak and oversaw the military direction of the President&apos;s Office. He has an extensive history in the Ukrainian military, including 25 deployments to eastern Ukraine, and helped found the Special Operations Forces. However, Zelensky was unhappy with Mashovets&apos; work, according to unnamed sources cited by Ukrainian media outlet New Voice of Ukraine (NV). On Nov. 30, Zelensky appointed Pavlo Palisa, former commander of Ukraine&apos;s famous 93rd Mechanized Brigade, as deputy head of the President&apos;s Office, which the source said helped pave the way for Mashovets&#x2019; dismissal. &#x201C;The president needs timely and real information from the front, information about the needs of the military, which is why they chose Palisa,&#x201D; the source told NV. The source also claims that Mashovets&#x2019; relationship with intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov was a &#x201C;trigger for a long time,&#x201D; although they did not expand on who exactly was triggered. Mashovets did not respond to NV&#x2019;s request for comment. Cabinet reshuffles were commonplace in 2024. Zelensky said on Dec. 28 that his team is &quot;preparing several important personnel decisions&quot; that will be &quot;announced soon.&quot;Two days later on Dec. 30, Zelensky dismissed Ruslan Kravchenko, the governor of Kyiv Oblast, and Filip Pronin, the governor of Poltava Oblast. According to a Telegram post from lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, the two are slated to be appointed heads of the Tax and Financial Supervision Commissions, respectively.In September, &#xA0;Zelensky launched the largest wartime government reshuffle, replacing key ministers and appointing a number of new advisors and deputies.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-dismisses-presidential-office-deputy-head/	2024-12-31T00:54:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2007077603.jpg

China's Xi tells Putin two countries always move forward 'hand in hand'	Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged New Year greetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 31. Xi emphasized that China and Russia consistently advance together on a &quot;path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party,&quot; according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. Xi added that &quot;the political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have continuously marched to a higher level under the strategic guidance of the two leaders.&quot; China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Since February 2022, Putin has traveled to China twice &#x2014; first just days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and again in May 2024. Xi is also set to make an official visit to Russia next year, according to the Kremlin&#x2019;s ambassador to Beijing, Igor Morgulov, who spoke to Russian media on Dec. 27. Morgulov said that while plans for several bilateral events are being finalized, Xi&#x2019;s visit remains a top priority. &quot;What can be said, and this is no secret, is that the chairman of the People&apos;s Republic of China is expected in Russia next year,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-xi-tells-putin-two-countries-always-move-forward-hand-in-hand/	2024-12-30T19:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1729825016.jpg
Oil depot on fire in Russia's Smolensk region following drone attack	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An oil depot in the Yartsevo district of Russia&apos;s Smolensk region caught fire following a drone attack overnight on Dec. 31, according to regional authorities. &quot;A Ukrainian drone attack targeted a fuel and energy facility, resulting in fires,&quot; Yartsevo district head, Roman Zakharov, wrote on his Telegram channel. Emergency response teams have reportedly been dispatched to the scene to extinguish the flames. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify Zakahrov&apos;s claims. Multiple explosions were heard in the Smolensk region and the city of Oryol in western Russia, according to several Telegram monitoring channels. Authorities have not provided further details on casualties or the extent of the damage. Smolensk region shares borders with several Russian and Belarus regions and is located approximately 390 kilometers from Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-on-fire-in-russias-smolensk-region-following-drone-attack/	2024-12-30T18:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/d59b4f695224a71f481416612d0bc5d5.webp
Ukraine can help restore stability in Syria after years of Russian interference, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine has a chance to contribute to restoring stability in Syria after years of Russian interference, emphasizing that this effort will also bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s own pursuit of peace. &quot;It would be the right step to restore our diplomatic relations and economic cooperation with Syria,&quot; he said during his evening address on Dec. 30. &quot;And I really hope that post-Assad Syria will respect international law &#x2013; something Assad couldn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t want to do.&quot; Zelesnky also expressed gratitude to Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who raised the Ukrainian flag over the Honorary Consulate in Damascus on the same day. &quot;I would also like to thank Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Affairs Ministry team and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food for organizing our delegation&#x2019;s visit to Damascus &#x2013; to the new Syria,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I look forward to receiving reports from the ministers on the negotiations and the initial results. This demonstrates Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership and agility in foreign policy &#x2013; qualities that can deliver the positive outcomes we need.&quot; Ukraine has acted swiftly to rebuild relations with Syria following the overthrow of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad&#x2019;s Russia-backed regime on Dec. 8. Sybiha&#x2019;s visit marked the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years, signaling an effort to restore diplomatic ties severed in 2022 after Assad aligned with Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During his visit, Sybiha highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s readiness to reestablish diplomatic relations, trade, and educational exchanges with Syria, provided the new leadership adheres to international law and respects territorial integrity. On Dec. 27, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine had delivered 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria under its &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-can-help-restore-stability-in-syria-after-years-of-russian-interference-zelensky-says/	2024-12-30T17:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2191168154.jpg
Germany indicts 3 in alleged Russian espionage plot	German prosecutors have indicted three individuals accused of plotting sabotage and espionage against military and industrial sites in Germany, Deutsche Welle reported on Dec. 30. The suspects, all dual German-Russian nationals, allegedly aimed to disrupt Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia&apos;s all-out war. The primary suspect, identified as Dieter S., is believed to be a former member of a pro-Russian militia in Ukraine, which German authorities classify as a terrorist group. Prosecutors claim he maintained contact with another former militia member tied to Russian intelligence. According to the indictment, Dieter S. agreed to carry out arson and explosive attacks on German soil. He reportedly scouted potential targets, including facilities used by the U.S. Armed Forces, a railway hub, and a manufacturing company. One of the sites under consideration was the U.S. Grafenwohr base in Bavaria, where Ukrainian troops receive training to operate American tanks. Prosecutors also allege that he took photos and videos of the targets and shared them with a Russian intelligence agent. Two accomplices are accused of assisting in the plot. The trio&apos;s arrest in April led to a diplomatic standoff between Germany and Russia, with Germany summoning the Russian ambassador. Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the case a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Russian espionage: &quot;We can never accept that such espionage activities take place in Germany.&quot; In response, the Russian Embassy in Berlin dismissed the allegations, claiming Germany had not provided evidence of the suspects&apos; plans or their connections to Russian operatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-indicts-3-in-alleged-russian-espionage-plot/	2024-12-30T15:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2158999755.jpg
NATO to strengthen Baltic Sea military presence following suspected underwater cable sabotage	NATO allies met on Dec. 30 to address the security of critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, following damage to undersea cables connecting Estonia and Finland several days earlier. The Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia, sustained significant damage on Christmas Day. Authorities are treating the incident as a potential act of sabotage. At a press conference on Dec. 26, Finnish police announced that damage to the cable in the Gulf of Finland was likely caused by a Russian tanker suspected to be part of Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The shadow fleet refers to a network of ships allegedly used by Russia to bypass sanctions, such as those restricting oil sales. The damaged cables, currently under investigation by Finnish authorities, are among several recent incidents in the Baltic Sea being examined as potential sabotage. As a response to the incidents, NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster vigilance, enhance situational awareness, and deter future threats. Allies are also exploring further measures to safeguard critical undersea infrastructure, leveraging support from NATO&#x2019;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May of this year. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has also raised concerns about the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; following recent damage to undersea cables across Europe. &quot;Almost every month, ships are currently damaging important undersea cables in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Baerbock told Germany&#x2019;s Funke media group on Dec. 28. She described suspicious activities by ship crews, including dropping anchors and dragging them along the seabed for kilometers without explanation. &quot;Ship crews lower anchors into the water, drag them for kilometers across the seabed for no apparent reason, and then lose them when they pull them up,&quot; she said, adding that the string of incidents over recent months is unlikely to be coincidental.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-strengthen-baltic-sea-military-presence-following-suspected-underwater-cable-sabotage/	2024-12-30T12:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv brings back 189 Ukrainians from Russian captivity; US unveils $2.5 billion in aid	Key developments on Dec. 30: Ukraine brought back 189 Ukrainian citizens from Russian captivity on Dec. 30 in one of the largest prisoner exchanges during the full-scale war. Eighty-seven Armed Forces service members, 43 National Guard members, 33 border guards, 24 sailors, and two civilians were among those released. The freed captives included soldiers who defended Azovstal and Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the Snake Island, and other sections of the front. At the same time, 150 Russian military service members were released from Ukrainian captivity as part of the exchange, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Some of the freed captives have been held by Russia for more than two and half years and suffer chronic diseases and injuries, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said. As of Dec. 30, Ukraine freed 3,956 people from Russian captivity since the start of the full-scale war, including 1,358 who were released this year. Ukraine and Russia held numerous prisoner exchanges throughout the full-scale war with the mediation of a third-party country. The previous swap occurred in mid-October, with each side bringing back 95 prisoners. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new security assistance package for Ukraine worth nearly $2.5 billion on Dec. 30. The package includes a $1.25 billion &quot;drawdown package&quot; of military equipment for Ukraine and $1.22 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), a Pentagon-led program that procures arms for Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. According to a White House statement, the resources will provide both immediate and long-term military support, including air defense systems, artillery, and other critical weaponry. &quot;As I committed earlier this year, the Department of Defense has now allocated all remaining USAI funds appropriated by Congress in the supplemental that I signed in April, and my Administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine,&quot; Biden said in the statement. &quot;I&#x2019;ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible &#x2014; including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,&quot; he added. The announcement comes just weeks before Donald Trump takes office next month. Russian forces have suffered around 427,000 soldiers killed or wounded this year, mainly in battles in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 30. &quot;Russia continues to carry out constant &apos;human wave&apos; assaults, suffering record losses. Last week, Russian forces have been losing around 1,700 people killed and wounded every day,&quot; Syrskyi said on Telegram after visiting units deployed in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces have been advancing at a rapid pace in late 2024, closing in on key Donetsk Oblast towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk, or Kurakhove at the cost of record losses. Heavy battles continue also in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Kyiv has warned about possible Russian advances in Ukraine&apos;s south. Ukraine claimed that Moscow&apos;s troops suffered their highest casualties in November and December, putting Russia&apos;s overall losses throughout the full-scale war at nearly 790,000 by the end of the year. The figures could not be independently verified. Moscow does not reveal the scale of its war losses but alleges they are lower than those of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, in addition to 370,000 injuries. Russia launched more than 1,300 drones and over 250 missiles of various types against Kyiv in 2024, Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, announced on Dec. 30. Throughout the year, the capital endured over 500 air raid alerts and nearly 200 airstrikes. Among the missiles targeting Kyiv were over 200 cruise missiles &#x2014; including Kh-101, Kh-59, Kh-69, Iskander-K, and Kalibr &#x2014; 24 ballistic missiles such as the Iskander-M and KN-23, 22 air-launched ballistic missiles, Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, and seven Zircon hypersonic missiles, according to Popko. &quot;These are terrifying numbers. But the most horrifying fact is that these rockets and drones killed our residents and destroyed our homes,&quot; Popko wrote on Telegram. Nearly 550 residential buildings in Kyiv were damaged by Russian attacks in 2024, leaving around 120 people homeless, Popko said. &quot;But the state will rebuild everything, ensuring housing for all, including Kyivans whose homes were destroyed by Russia and internally displaced Ukrainians who have made the capital their home,&quot; he added, noting that Kyiv saw an increase of nearly 11,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) over the past year. Energy infrastructure was also heavily targeted, forcing Kyiv residents to endure approximately 100 days of power outages, with daily blackouts averaging nine hours, according to Popko. &quot;Although Kyiv has officially not been considered a zone of potential hostilities for two years, the war &apos;reminds&apos; us of itself every day,&quot; he wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/uwl-kyiv-brings-back-189-ukrainians-from-russian-captivity/	2024-12-30T11:11:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-30_18-53-24.jpg
Governors of Kyiv and Poltava oblasts dismissed amid position reshuffles	Ruslan Kravchenko, the governor of Kyiv Oblast, and Filip Pronin, the governor of Poltava Oblast, were dismissed on Dec. 30 and are expected to be appointed to new positions soon. According to a Telegram post from lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, the two are slated to be appointed heads of the Tax and Financial Supervision Commissions, respectively. The move comes shortly after President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his team is &quot;preparing several important personnel decisions&quot; that will be &quot;announced soon.&quot; Kravchenko served as governor of Kyiv Oblast since April 2023. Prior to his appointment as governor, he was the chief prosecutor of Kyiv Oblast&apos;s Bucha District Pronin has been governor of Poltava Oblast since October 2023. He previously held anti-corruption roles at various government agencies. Their dismissals were approved by the government a few days ago before the official decrees were signed.	https://kyivindependent.com/governors-of-kyiv-and-poltava-oblasts-dismissed-in-position-reshuffles/	2024-12-30T11:03:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Ukraine quadruples domestic gas transit fees as Russian gas pipeline deal expires	Ukraine will increase gas transit tariffs for its domestic customers fourfold starting Jan. 1 when a deal to transport Russian gas through Ukrainian pipes expires, the National Energy Regulatory Commission said during a meeting on Dec. 30. Russia has been paying Ukraine transport fees to carry its gas through underground Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 deal between the two countries. Ukraine has repeatedly said that it will not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of this year. During the meeting, the director of Ukraine&apos;s gas transit operator GTS Operator, Dmytro Lyppa, said that the Russian deal previously covered 85% of the operator&apos;s income from gas transit, according to reporting from Liga.net. Lyppa also said that the tariff hike would not cover the full loss of income from the deal&apos;s expiry, and that the company was taking all possible measures to reduce its costs. Many European countries have already sharply decreased their use of Russian gas following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but many countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, still rely on Russian gas. Last week, Slovakia threatened to cut electricity supplies to Ukraine if Ukraine goes through with its promise to halt Russian gas transit.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-quadruples-domestic-gas-transit-fees-as-russian-gas-pipeline-deal-expires/	2024-12-30T10:25:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1240592117.jpg
Ukraine's police name Russian commander suspected of murder of woman who became symbol of Bucha massacre	The Ukrainian police on Dec. 29 named the Russian commander who is suspected to be responsible for the murder of Iryna Filkina, the Ukrainian woman who came to symbolize the mass murder of civilians in Bucha in 2022. The photo of Filkina&apos;s hand with brightly painted fingernails went viral around the world, becoming one of the most well-known symbols of the massacre that Russian forces carried out against Ukrainian civilians in the Kyiv Oblast town in the early stages of the full-scale war. Russian officer Artyom Tarieiev, commander of the 234th Airborne Assault Regiment of the 76th Division of the Russian Airborne Forces, gave orders on March 5, 2022, to kill all civilians who appeared at an intersection during the occupation of Bucha, according to a statement by the Bucha City Council. On the same day, Filkina was shot by more than 15 Russian bullets while riding a bicycle. Filkina was an employee of the Ukrainian hypermarket chain Epicenter. According to the National Police&apos;s investigation, 13 civilians were killed on the same street as a result of Tarieiev&apos;s order. &quot;Identifying the suspect is an important step in the investigation of war crimes on the territory of Ukraine,&quot; said the Bucha City Council statement. &quot;All those involved in the killings of civilians must be brought to justice internationally.&quot; After Bucha was liberated in March 2022, authorities uncovered mass graves of civilians who were killed during its occupation. In March 2023, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that more than 1,400 civilians were killed in Bucha District, including 637 in the city of Bucha, many of whom had gunshot wounds. The district figure included 37 children who were murdered by Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-commander-suspect-bucha-massacre/	2024-12-30T10:15:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1242651605.jpg
Ukraine’s exports grew 13% in 2024 amid stabilized port activity, Economy Ministry says	Preliminary data shows that Ukraine&#x2019;s exports grew by more than 13% over the past year, primarily due to stabilizing the functioning of Ukrainian seaports, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said on Dec. 30. As of Dec. 26, Ukraine exported 129.2 million metric tons of goods worth $41.043 billion, up from $36.1 billion the same time last year, a statement from the ministry said. Ukraine managed to restart maritime trade in the Black Sea despite Russian attempts at blockade, unilaterally opening a shipping corridor after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in 2023. The recovery and development of production in Ukraine also played a role in export growth, Svyrydenko said. The European Union remained Ukraine&#x2019;s largest trading partner, with $24.5 billion in exports &#x2014; 59% of the year&apos;s total and $1 billion higher than the previous year. Aside from the EU, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest export trading partners this year were China ($2.3 billion), Turkey ($2.1 billion), Egypt ($1.6 billion), India ($986 million), and Moldova ($935 million). Ukraine&#x2019;s top exports include processed and raw agricultural products and metallurgy products.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-exports-grew-13-in-2024-amid-stabilized-port-activity-economy-ministry-says/	2024-12-30T09:48:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
Ukrainian startups cut demining time by centuries with new tech	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This story was sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine. When a sapper with the call sign &#x201C;Boroda&#x201D; asked his friends, the founders of the Rovertech company, to create something for demining, and provided them with his own sketch, they seized on the idea. &#x201C;He made us make something so that he would not risk his life so much. We tortured each other until we finally did it,&#x201D; Borys Drozhak, the co-founder of Rovertech, told the Kyiv Independent. The company designed the &#x201C;Zmiy&#x201D; (Snake) remote demining vehicle. This is just one example of Ukrainian startup industry&#x2019;s initiatives to foster the country&#x2019;s mine-clearing efforts. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion turned Ukraine into the most mined country in the world, putting at risk the lives of Ukrainian people for generations to come. According to Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, a total of 174,000 square kilometers (67,000 square miles) of Ukraine&#x2019;s land have been considered to be potentially contaminated following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite ongoing hostilities, Ukraine has reduced the area considered as potentially hazardous by over 35,000 square kilometers (13,500 square miles). &#x201C;Zmiy&#x201D; (Snake) remote demining vehicle showcased during the second phase of unmanned sensor testing, an initiative by UNDP and the Economy Ministry of Ukraine, in an unidentified location in May 2024. (UNDP in Ukraine)Empty shells lie on the ground. According to a Globsec report, it could take over 700 years to clear Ukraine with the current resources. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion has made Ukraine the most mined country, endangering lives for generations. (UNDP in Ukraine)But even after that reduction, Ukraine&#x2019;s potentially mined areas are estimated to equal 139,000 square kilometers (54,000 square miles), which exceeds the size of Greece, Bulgaria or Austria, and almost exactly equals the size of North Carolina, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. According to a Globsec report, it might take over 700 years to clear Ukraine using existing resources. But the country&#x2019;s plans are far more ambitious. However, Ukrainian officials say they aim to clear 80% of potentially mined land over the next 10 years. Achieving this goal would massively reduce the threat of mines and its impact on the Ukrainian people&#x2019;s lives. They count on the breakthrough technologies to speed up this process. &#x201C;Today, we are witnessing a game-changing shift as innovative technologies, enabled by our support, rapidly accelerate the process and position Ukraine as a global pioneer in mine action innovation,&#x201D; said Jaco Cilliers, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine. UNDP in Ukraine has been at the forefront of transforming Ukraine&apos;s mine action sector, working hand-in-hand with the country&#x2019;s government. A number of countries have allocated funds for Ukraine&#x2019;s demining under the UNDP Mine Action Programme. &#x201C;Each breakthrough by Ukrainian companies is undeniable proof that Ukraine is a nation of trailblazers and changemakers,&#x201D; Cilliers said. This year, Kyiv launched a humanitarian demining market in which the state covers 100% of the cost of demining agricultural land, Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. &quot;We managed to sign agreements with mine action operators to clear more than 8,000 hectares of agricultural land,&quot; she added. Modern approaches in humanitarian demining are aimed at saving time, money and people&#x2019;s lives. Vitalii Lopushanskyi, the founder of the UADamage startup, suggests it could take even less than 10 years to map mined areas in Ukraine. That would be possible, he says, if those involved in demining use drones. To determine the contaminated areas, Lopushankyi&#x2019;s team equips drones with the special sensors. Shortly after the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Lopushanskyi&#x2019;s company started digitizing damaged infrastructure and buildings using artificial intelligence and satellite data. The team&#x2019;s priorities changed after Lopushanskyi witnessed two civilian cars being blown up by mines in the formerly occupied part of Kherson Oblast. &#x201C;I realized that no one can (start) rebuilding without demining. First, we need to make the territories safe,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. The startup has developed a technology that uses satellite images and drones to remotely detect explosives. While using aerial sensors in demining isn&#x2019;t entirely new, the company&#x2019;s unique technology combines several sensors. The technology is already being used to map contaminated areas in Ukraine. When Ukraine&#x2019;s needs are fully covered, the startup is ready to share this demining technology with other countries. In the long run, UADamage aims to combine it with robots that operate on the ground to clear the mines. &#x201C;As a result, it (the technology) will replace humans,&#x201D; Lopushanskyi said. To help map the mined areas, the UADamage teamed up with the Ukrainian Researchers Society. The group, mainly consisting of geographers, also analyzes the territories using satellite images. They use a neural network, a type of AI technology, to analyze the images and define potentially mined areas, Pavlo Ostapenko, head of the Ukrainian Researchers Society, told the Kyiv Independent. For example, using satellite images, it is possible to tell if fields have been cultivated recently or not &#x2013; this is a clear first indicator of the potential presence of explosive hazards. The fieldwork of the Ukrainian Researchers Society, whose main priority is clearing Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural land of mines. (Ukrainian Researchers Society)Today, the Ukrainian Researcher Society&apos;s priority is to clear Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural land of mines. A total of 199 Ukrainian farmers have been killed by mines or explosive devices since the beginning of the all-out war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Ministry. To speed up the process, Kozak&#x2019;s team developed a drone that collects magnetic field data, resulting in a map showing anomalies. This map can be used by sappers or farmers. The MinesEye project, led by the charitable foundation PostUp, equips agronomic drones with a sophisticated sensor that helps to search for mines and explosive ordnance both on the surface and under the soil of a contaminated area, Kozak told the Kyiv Independent. It can detect most explosive objects. &#x201C;(This) allows us to significantly reduce the cost of demining itself due to the fact that we can prioritize the territory in question, that is, find areas that are more contaminated and less contaminated,&#x201D; Kozak said. PostUp will be deploying one of the cutting edge MinesEye systems in support of the demining units of Ukraine&#x2019;s State Emergency Service (SESU) Units across the first half of 2025, in a project supported by UNDP. Following on from testing conducted on such systems by UNDP in August 2024, the MinesEye system will be put to work by SESU teams, supported by Kozak and his colleagues, in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most heavily mine-affected areas. Created by Rovertech startup, the &#x201C;Zmiy&#x201D; ground drone became the first remote demining vehicle that was developed and certified in Ukraine. &#x201C;The sappers told us that they need us since they do not see any other way. Other demining machines are just an unrealistic story. It takes them (sappers) a long time to clear everything by hand,&#x201D; said Drozhak, the co-founder of Rovertech. Although it weighs nearly a ton, the &#x201C;Zmiy&#x201D; is considered a lightweight vehicle. It means it can be faster and can handle larger areas, compared to other demining machines. Once launched, the vehicle moves around the area, hitting the land to activate the mines. The vehicle can withstand explosions of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines. The key advantage of the machine over its foreign-made counterparts is its cost. While average demining machines cost up to a million euros, the &#x201C;Zmiy&#x201D; has an estimated price tag of around $20,000, according to the Rovertech co-founder.

(UNDP in Ukraine)Developments of Ukrainian companies were showcased during the second phase of unmanned sensor testing, an initiative by UNDP and the Economy Ministry of Ukraine, in an unidentified location in May 2024. (Nazarii Mazyliuk / UNDP in Ukraine)The company currently produces up to 40 machines per month but plans to double the production in the near future. In Drozhak&#x2019;s estimation, about 700 such vehicles are needed for humanitarian demining of all Ukraine areas that are considered mined.

Zelensky appoints human rights activist Olha Reshetylova as first military ombudsman	President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed human rights activist Olha Reshetylova to the newly created position of military ombudsman on Dec. 30. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. The ombudsman &quot;will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of service members, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of service members and their families,&quot; the Defense Ministry said at the time. Reshetylova previously co-founded and headed the Media Initiative for Human Rights, which has investigated war crimes related to the Russian war in Ukraine since 2016 and advocates for changes in government policies and social practices related to protecting human rights. In 2014, Reshetylova co-founded Come Back Alive, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest civilian fundraising organizations that purchases military items. &quot;Olha is a well-known, experienced, and effective Ukrainian human rights activist. She has already done a lot to build our state institutions and support Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said in his statement. &quot;Now the main task is to prepare, together with the Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry and civil society, a draft law on the Military Ombudsman and all the necessary systemic foundations for the work of this institution.&quot; Calls to fill the position grew sharper in recent days following allegations of abuse in the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-human-rights-activist-olha-reshetylova-as-first-military-ombudsman/	2024-12-30T09:30:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-30-13_25_49.jpeg
German prosecutors charge 3 with spying for Russia	Germany&apos;s Federal Prosecutor&apos;s Office charged three German-Russian citizens from the town of Bayreuth with spying for Moscow, the office&apos;s spokesperson told Der Spiegel newspaper on Dec. 30. The main suspect is 40-year-old Dieter S., a former member of Russian proxy forces in Ukraine who the prosecutors said took pictures of military facilities and planned railway sabotage. Warnings about Russian hybrid attacks and sabotage operations against NATO countries have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Der Spiegel reported that Dieter S. and his two suspected accomplices, 38-year-old Alexander J. and 43-year-old Alex D., are believed to have &quot;explored&quot; potential targets in Bavaria, including the U.S. Grafenwoehr military base where Ukrainian soldiers are being trained. Apart from sabotaging railway tracks, the suspects were allegedly discussing bomb attacks and arson with the aim of undermining Germany&apos;s support for Kyiv, Der Spiegel reported. German investigators said that Dieter S. had links to Russian intelligence services and previously fought for Russian proxy forces against Ukraine in Donbas between 2014 and 2016, including at the Donetsk International Airport, for which he was already charged in October. Dieter S. and Alexander J. were arrested in April following an initial investigation by German security services, though Der Spiegel reported that the arrest warrant against J. was later suspended without providing reason. NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General James Appathurai warned earlier this week that a Russian hybrid attack against an allied country could potentially lead to &quot;substantial&quot; casualties as sabotage cases surged in 2024. In the most recent case, the Finnish authorities seized the Eagle S tanker transporting Russian oil on suspicion it cut an undersea cable between Finland and Estonia.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-prosecutors-charge-3-with-spying-for-russia/	2024-12-30T09:26:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-200515448-001.jpg
Kyiv, Damascus hold 'similar view' on Russian military presence in Syria, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha expressed Kyiv&apos;s position on Russia&apos;s military presence in Syria to leaders of the new Syrian administration during a diplomatic visit to Damascus on Dec. 30, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said at an online meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent. The Ukrainian delegation &quot;informed our colleagues&quot; about their position, and Syrian counterparts hold &quot;a similar view,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Dec. 30 in response to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s query. Tykhyi did not elaborate further on the specifics of the conversation. Ukraine has moved quickly to restore ties with Syria after rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Sybiha&apos;s visit marked the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years and is a sign of efforts to rebuild diplomatic ties cut by Ukraine in 2022 after Assad sided with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During his visit, Sybiha emphasized that Ukraine is ready to restore diplomatic ties, trade, and educational exchanges with Syria if the country&apos;s new leadership respects international law and its territorial integrity. On Dec. 27, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine had sent 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria as part of its &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-syria-discuss-russian-presence/	2024-12-30T08:20:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/IMG_5361.JPG
Former Armenian defense minister briefly detained in Moscow	Armenia&apos;s former defense minister, Major General Arshak Karapetyan, was detained in Moscow on Dec. 29 and later released, the Armenian Interior Ministry confirmed for the Novosti-Armenia news agency. Karapetyan was detained at Armenia&apos;s request and was subsequently released from custody on bail, the Russian state-news agency TASS reported. The Armenian government previously placed the former defense minister on the international wanted list for &quot;participation in illegal business activity,&quot; abuse of power, and abuse of official position. Karapetyan served as Armenia&apos;s defense minister between August and November 2021 and as an advisor to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan from 2018 to 2021. According to Pashinyan, the former minister was dismissed after reporting full control over the border on the morning of Nov. 14, 2021, even though Azerbaijani troops &quot;invaded (Armenian) territory in several sections and even took up positions.&quot; Karapetyan subsequently launched an opposition political group called the All-Armenian Front, advocating for closer ties with Russia and Iran. Relations between Yerevan and Moscow, traditionally close military allies, have deteriorated after Russian peacekeepers did not prevent the Azerbaijani 2023 offensive that led to Baku&apos;s capture of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.	https://kyivindependent.com/former-armenian-defense-minister-briefly-detained-in-moscow/	2024-12-30T08:10:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/-------_-------_------_------_-_------_----------_-_---------_--------_03_-Arshak_Karapetyan-.jpg
I survived a Russian torture camp. So I had to see Assad's Sednaya prison	Editor&apos;s Note: Stanislav Aseyev is a Ukrainian writer, journalist, veteran, and a survivor of the Izolyatsia prison in Russia-occupied Donetsk, infamous for its torture of prisoners. He was the first Ukrainian journalist to see to the Sednaya prison and death camp in Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime in 2024. This piece was originally published in Ukrainian on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. It has been translated and republished with the author&apos;s permission. I conceived this piece as an attempt to compare the modern systems of dehumanization that still exist and function in different corners of the world. After spending 2.5 years in Russia&apos;s secret prison Izolyatsiya and enduring its torture regime, I felt it was essential, both as a survivor and a writer, to examine the elements of a similar system on another continent. Are these systems shaped by ethnic factors, or is the extreme cruelty humans inflict on one another simply a manifestation of our species&#x2019; inherent inclination for sadism? Syria&apos;s Sednaya prison serves as yet another argument for the latter view, challenging the very notion of humanity&#x2019;s ethical progress. Beirut. It&apos;s 18 degrees Celsius. The hum of an Israeli drone overhead, chaotic traffic, bombed-out buildings, yellow Hezbollah advertisements, checkpoints, and men with bright balloons against a backdrop of ruins. I ask my guide who they are. &quot;Refugees,&quot; they say &#x2014; Syrians and Palestinians trying to make a living, however meager, by selling balloons, fish, and birds &#x2014; literally pushing them into car windows. Meanwhile, motorcyclists narrowly avoid collisions, cut off by dented cars: Finding a car without damage in Beirut is nearly impossible, and no one seems to care anymore. This is where the road to Syria&apos;s Sednaya prison begins &#x2014; another of humanity&apos;s grim discoveries in the realm of torture and executions.

(Omar Haj Kadour / AFP via Getty Images)One can now enter Bashar al-Assad&apos;s death camp only through Lebanon. I arrived in the country accompanied by officers from Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence (HUR). They are tasked with evacuating Ukrainian citizens from Syria and simultaneously ensuring my safe passage to Sednaya with the highest possible level of security. The issue of safety begins in the Beqaa Valley, where we must travel to reach the Syrian border. Like Beirut, the valley is fragmented into various zones of influence but in a more chaotic and informal way. The term &quot;control&quot; here is relative &#x2014; no one controls anything completely in Beqaa. The valley is divided between Hezbollah and local gangs involved in arms, drug, and human trafficking. It encompasses both small, ordinary towns and isolated hideouts in the mountains, where various groups take refuge. Additionally, some Russians have partially moved into Beqaa after fleeing Homs, which was the worst piece of news for me amid all the other risks. I was warned about this back when we were in Istanbul, heading here. Crossing the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon on the way to Sednaya prison in Syria on Dec. 20, 2024. (Stanislav Aseyev)Having received some guarantees of safety, we reach the Lebanese-Syrian border, where an unusual situation arises regarding our passports. The issue is that Syria does not currently stamp passports for entry or exit due to the ongoing change of power. This creates a strange scenario: You leave Lebanon seemingly for nowhere and return as if from nowhere, judging by your passport stamps. Before departing Beirut for the Syrian border, we had conflicting information about who controls the border, including the possibility that it might be entirely unguarded. However, at the very first checkpoint, we encounter men in military uniforms &#x2014; members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, effectively the new Syrian regime. The second checkpoint is under the same group&#x2019;s control, though the scene is slightly different: About a dozen armed civilians rush to the vehicle, shouting and gesturing for us to move quickly.

(Stanislav Aseyev)Upon entering Syria, the changes in the country become immediately apparent: Syrians have removed or painted over Bashar al-Assad&#x2019;s portraits wherever possible, replaced the red stripe on the national flag with a green one, and added a star, and just outside Damascus, you come across burned-out tanks and even a destroyed Russian Pantsir air defense system.

(Stanislav Aseyev)&apos;The human slaughterhouse&apos;In Damascus, we are met by Ali, a representative of the new regime, who has agreed to accompany us to Sednaya. The prison is about a 30-minute drive from the capital. Even as we approach this concentration camp, its scale is staggering. It resembles a small, enclosed city, surrounded by barbed-wire fences, watchtowers, and, reportedly, a perimeter laden with landmines. During our visit, the prison caught fire, shrouding its grounds and buildings in acrid smoke. One of the buildings of the Sednaya prison in Syria, seen on Dec. 20, 2024.

These are the results of searches for underground prison chambers, where the majority of the inmates were believed to have been held.

(Stanislav Aseyev)Though we arrived in Sednaya late in the day, even at that hour, we encountered a Syrian family walking through the prison grounds, desperately searching for any trace of their relatives who had been detained there. Every building had already been searched, but such families still hope to find hidden underground chambers whose entrances may have been overlooked. Relatives post photographs of their loved ones around the grounds &#x2014; people who disappeared behind the prison&#x2019;s walls many years ago. Of everything I witnessed in Sednaya, this was, for me personally, the most haunting sight.

(Stanislav Aseyev)Photos of prisoners sought by their families, Syria on Dec. 20, 2024. (Stanislav Aseyev)After the prison administration seemingly vanished into thin air, abandoning thousands of inmates in their cells, no one can definitively say how many people were held here &#x2014; or might still be here. It is evident that if underground floors exist, no one has provided food or, worse, water to any prisoners there for weeks. This makes the likelihood of finding anyone alive in such chambers slim. The entire site feels like a cemetery, but one that still stirs with faint signs of life. On our way back, Ukrainian citizens evacuated from Syria by the Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence recounted that in Latakia, nearly everyone has acquaintances or relatives who had been imprisoned during Assad&apos;s regime. One former prisoner recalled counting 72 stairs when he was led, hooded, up from his cell to another level, and then back. The use of underground detention practices was prevalent here, much like it is in Russia. However, the search for underground chambers at Sednaya yielded no results, and by the time of our visit, it had been called off. According to our guide, Ali, the theory of underground facilities is based on information from two sources. Ali, a representative of the new Syrian regime, and Stanislav Aseyev (R) in Syria on Dec. 20, 2024. (Stanislav Aseyev)First, some of those released from Sednaya recount being held in windowless rooms for a time before being moved upstairs. Second, according to Syria&#x2019;s Interior Ministry, the number of prisoners at Sednaya was estimated to be in the tens of thousands, while only about 2,000 have been freed. However, this argument is undermined by the torture and execution chambers at the prison, which had been set up for large-scale operations. The discovery of a press used for crushing people, the so-called &quot;acid room,&quot; and systematic executions that human rights organizations have documented all these years suggest that the Assad regime has simply killed the missing prisoners. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in London and monitoring the war in Syria, more than 30,000 prisoners were executed or died from starvation, medical neglect, or torture between 2011 and 2018.

(Stanislav Aseyev)Abandoned room of Sednaya&apos;s administration, Syria on Dec. 20, 2024. (Stanislav Aseyev)The first floor of Sednaya housed administrative facilities such as the kitchen. There was also something resembling a &quot;temporary detention isolation unit,&quot; where those recently brought to the camp were held in cages before being sent to the upper floors. Above these areas was the prison&#x2019;s administration&apos;s offices. The administrative staff of Sendaya has fled, all of them. The upper floors of Sednaya were designated for prisoners: Divided into three blocks, they housed thousands of inmates in nearly bare cells. Ali mentions that in some cells, up to 50 people were crammed in, forcing the prisoners to sleep on their sides, pressed together to fit on the floor. It&apos;s important to note that this took place in a desert environment, with extreme temperature fluctuations: from scorching heat during the day to freezing cold at night. I&apos;ve heard of such sleeping arrangements from the criminals I met in the Izolyatsiya prison in Donetsk &#x2014; a similar practice existed in various penal facilities in Ukraine and Russia in the early 1990s. In general, the survival tactics of prisoners often mirror the methods of control over them, so places like Sednaya, Izolyatsiya, or Abu Ghraib share many common elements.

Prisoners had their spines broken by special boards, were beaten, raped, starved, and executed, with their remains dissolved in acid.

This evokes comparisons to the infamous Izolyatsiya prison, where even public transport in Donetsk would avoid stopping near the facility due to the fear it inspired. Today, Sednaya is a thing of the past. Now, as with any other abandoned Syrian building, the sun shines through its empty cells, illuminating the walls for the cameras of countless journalists, for whom it is just another job.

Partisans allegedly set ablaze two trains near Moscow destined for occupied Ukrainian territories	Ukrainian partisans in Russia&apos;s Moscow Oblast set fire to two locomotives overnight on Dec. 30 destined for occupied regions of Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an advisor to the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied Mariupol. In his Telegram post, Andryushchenko shared several videos showing the trains ablaze. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Members of the Mariupol resistance destroyed an electric train worth 50 million rubles ($460 million), while members of the Azov resistance group destroyed a diesel train, Adriushchenko wrote. Both trains suffered irreparable losses, he said. Ukrainian partisans have claimed several attacks recently on Russian transit infrastructure, including earlier this month when the Atesh partisan group said it had sabotaged a key railway line linking Russia&apos;s Moscow and Kursk oblasts, disrupting Russian supply lines. The group reported a similar act of sabotage on a railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast last month.	https://kyivindependent.com/saboteurs-destroy-two-trains-near-moscow-destined-for-occupied-ukraine-group-claims/	2024-12-30T07:53:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Picture1-1.png
Ukraine struck hundreds of targets deep inside Russia in 2024. What did they achieve?	As Russian troops continued to hold an advantage on the ground, Ukraine has been keen to level the power in the air. In 2024, Ukrainian forces bet on drones, hitting targets thousands of kilometers deep inside Russia. Ukrainian attacks have targeted dozens of oil refineries that aid Russia&apos;s war efforts, arms depots, weapon production plants, as well as military airfields harboring Moscow&apos;s air force. Strikes deep inside Russia would not stop the war but are said to have slowed down Russian advance, hindered logistics, and pushed arms depots further east. &quot;From what we can tell &#x2014; it&apos;s no longer a secret &#x2014; Ukrainian long-range unmanned aerial vehicles can hypothetically operate up to 2,000 kilometers,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said on Dec. 27. For Ukraine, 2024 was a breakthrough year in the deployment of long-range drones. In late September, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Ukrainian forces had destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology. Both Ukraine and Russia use this technology, which involves launching dozens, sometimes hundreds of drones at once, to overpower air defenses, usually in waves. Russia&apos;s outdated air defense systems, which are mainly designed to protect against large targets such as missiles or aircraft, do not always identify drones. Ukraine, producing long-range drones from scratch, managed to create thousands of them within a year. Ukrainian officials don&apos;t publicly confirm drone attacks, with the approximate number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) launched can only be estimated based on Russian reports, local independent media, or social media. According to Russian reports, Ukraine&apos;s largest drone attack on Russia took place on Sept. 1. Russian authorities claimed to have shot down 158 drones over 16 oblasts, including Moscow. The attack caused a fire at Gazpromneft&apos;s refinery in Moscow&apos;s Kapotnya district, after which the plant shut down half of its capacity, according to Reuters. This photo shows a damaged residential building following a drone attack in Ramenskoye in the Moscow Oblast on Sep. 10, 2024. (Tatyana Makeyeva / AFP via Getty Images)Power plants in Moscow and Tver oblasts were also targeted, and a gas distribution network in Tver Oblast&apos;s Konakovo was damaged. The second largest attack on record took place on Sept. 10, when Russian officials claimed that Russian air defense shot down 144 drones. The highest number of drones, 72, was reportedly downed over Bryansk Oblast, followed by Moscow Oblast (20) and Kursk Oblast (14). Moscow Oblast Governor Andrey Vorobyov said the drone&apos;s debris had fallen on residential buildings. In the town of Ramenskoye, located 46 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of Moscow, a 46-year-old woman was killed, and three people were injured. The September attacks showed how vulnerable Russian air defense is, as it cannot cover not only most of Russia&apos;s territory but also the area around its capital, Moscow. Mattias Eken, a defense and security expert at RAND Europe, told the Kyiv Independent that Russia will likely need to upgrade its radar technology to counter the increasing presence of small, cost-effective drones. This technology integrates optical and acoustic detection systems to detect drones reliably at long ranges, and the upgrade could take years, according to the expert. In the meantime, Russia is trying to defend its skies by increasing the number of mobile fire groups, among other methods. Ukraine has already proven that this step would also require large resources, given the long-range capabilities of its drones. Ukrainian drones are much cheaper than missiles in production but have an equally impressive range. According to Umerov, Ukraine has increased its long-range military capabilities &quot;several times&quot; this year. In April, Ukraine, for the first time, hit a target 1,300 kilometers (807 miles) from its state border. A Ukrainian long-range drone targeted one of Russia&apos;s largest oil refineries, located in the city of Nizhnekamsk in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan. The attack on Tatarstan also hit a manufacturing facility for Shahed-type attack drones at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the Yelabuga district. UAV attack in Tatarstan, Russia on April 2, 2024. (Screenshot from a video on social media)A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the drone hit the refinery&apos;s primary oil refining facility with an annual production capacity of around 8 million tons, amounting to 2.6% of Russia&apos;s yearly oil-processing capacity. In July, a Ukrainian drone set a new long-range record by striking the Olenya military airfield in Russia&apos;s Murmansk Oblast and damaging a Tu-22M3 bomber. The target was located 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the border. &quot;This (Tu-22M3 bomber) is something that only the Soviet Union could produce, and that is why they are trying to hide them so far away,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson, Andrii Yusov, said on national television on July 29. Long-range attacks forced Russia to relocate its aircraft, affecting the strategic planning of its future strikes on Ukraine. So far, Russia has moved 90% of its aircraft used to attack Ukraine over 300 kilometers from the Ukrainian border following the negotiations to allow long-range strike using U.S.-provided missiles deep into Russia. Yet, many Russian military facilities are immobile and thus are open targets for Ukrainian drones. Among the prized targets for Ukraine were Russian arms depots, storing weapons delivered to the front lines. Without direct access to the destroyed depots, it is difficult to calculate the scale of the destruction. In September, Ukrainian drones set ablaze at least 30,000 tons of ammunition, which allegedly included ballistic missiles. The depot in Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast was supposed to withstand a nuclear strike, as promised by the Russian authorities, but it failed to cope with Ukraine-produced drones. A unit of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service launched &#x2018;Black Fury&#x2019; drones at a missile warehouse in an unknown location on Nov. 12, 2024. (Olga Ivashchenko)The attack &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth a large warehouse of the main missile and artillery department of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Meanwhile, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in its intelligence report that strikes on Toropets and later on the depot in the town of Tikhoretsk destroyed a tonnage that is considered Russian &quot;largest loss of ammunition&quot; during its all-out war against Ukraine. Experts with whom the Kyiv Independent spoke said that even minor damage to warehouses, which may not be visible on satellite images, could lead to significant complications in Russia&apos;s logistics operations. &quot;If you launch 10 strikes with drones, and then the facility can&apos;t unload or store new munitions for five hours, six hours, or eight hours, by itself, it is a major effect because that facility isn&apos;t working for a day. It might not have damaged anything, but it&apos;s still going to have a battlefield impact because those munitions aren&apos;t going to reach the front line,&quot; Michael Bohnert, a licensed engineer at RAND research organization, told the Kyiv Independent. Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), added that more substantial losses, such as a month&apos;s worth of costly weapons, could slow down the pace of Russian troop advancement at the front line, as well as decrease the fire volume on Ukrainian soldiers. Energy exports have long been a key source of Moscow&apos;s revenue and have helped to sustain its ongoing war against Ukraine. Yet, the Russian oil industry has suffered the most from recent Ukrainian attacks, which have led to disruptions in production and a sharp rise in fuel prices in Russia. In late April, the cost of diesel went up almost 10%, while gasoline prices hit a six-month high, going up by more than 20% when compared to the start of the year, Politico reported. In the meantime, Russian gas giant Gazprom suffered net losses from January to June 2024, almost double those in the same period last year, according to its financial statements. In the wake of the attacks, many refineries also have been forced to suspend production. The Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries caused the output to fall by around 17%, according to NATO July calculations. In August, a Ukrainian strike on the Kavkaz oil refinery outside Proletarsk, a town in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, sparked a fire that lasted over two weeks. The fire spread to a petroleum storage facility, making it extremely difficult to extinguish.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)According to Reuters, as of November, at least three Russian oil refineries&#x2014;Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk &#x2014; had been forced to halt or scale back production due to significant losses and faced the risk of closure. Under regular Ukrainian attacks and pressure from Western sanctions, the Russian oil industry is finding new ways to continue its exports, including investing in the so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Meanwhile, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners have not yet found effective countermeasures, and Ukrainian attacks have not been able to completely derail Russia&apos;s oil production. Ukraine can produce at least 4 million drones a year, and more than 1.5 million have already been contracted, Zelensky said at the second International Defense Industries Forum in October. The Ukrainian army is not only approaching 2025 with a commitment to increase drone production. Ukraine is also looking to ramp up missile production amid a possible decline in arms supplies from Western partners, particularly the U.S. Zelensky has called for investment in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry to keep production high. &quot;Thanks to the defense industry, Ukraine will become one of the key global security contributors and a very strong player in the global arms and defense technology market. Everyone who is with us, who is with Ukraine, I am sure, will benefit,&quot; Zelensky added. The domestically produced missiles could be a potential game changer for Ukraine&apos;s attacks deep into Russia, especially since Kyiv will not have to rely solely on its allies. Yet, in the new year, the Ukrainian army will continue to face another, more dangerous threat &#x2014; the Russian grinding advance on the front line. And Ukraine still does not have enough missiles and drones to halt Russia&apos;s push north, east, and south.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struck-hundreds-of-targets-deep-inside-russia-in-2024-what-did-they-achieve/	2024-12-30T07:21:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-19_35_24.png
Ukraine brings back 189 people from Russian captivity in prisoner swap	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine managed to bring back 189 Ukrainians from Russian captivity, including military service members and two civilians, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 30. The Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) called it one of the largest prisoner exchanges since the start of the full-scale war in 2022. &quot;We are working to free each and every one from Russian captivity. This is our goal. We do not forget anyone,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. The freed captives included soldiers who defended Azovstal and Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the Snake Island, and other sections of the front. Eighty-seven Armed Forces service members, 43 National Guard members, 33 border guards, and 24 sailors were among those released, according to the headquarters. Azov fighters were also freed during the latest exchange, Zelensky said. Ukrainians freed from Russian captivity who returned to Ukraine on Dec. 30, 2024.

Ukraine's leading phone operator Kyivstar announces new agreement with Starlink	Ukraine&apos;s largest telecommunications operator, Kyivstar, signed an agreement to become one of the first countries with access to Starlink&apos;s direct-to-cell service, the Ukrainian telecom operator announced on Dec. 30. The new service will help stabilize the country&apos;s national communications infrastructure and is expected to launch messaging services toward the end of 2025, with voice and data transmission to follow, according to an announcement from Kyivstar. Telecom companies in Ukraine have periodically experienced network outages during the war due to hacks and blackouts. Cyberattacks have become an increasingly common tool employed by both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war. In January, the company reported that one large-scale cyber attack cost it nearly $100 million. According to the company&apos;s statement, Veon, the parent company of Kyivstar, has invested more than $10 billion in Ukraine since 2013 and has committed to invest another $1 billion in the restoration of digital infrastructure by 2027. Kyivstar serves around 23.3 million mobile subscribers and more than 1.1 million home internet subscribers. SpaceX&apos;s Starlink satellite internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. Last month, U.S. lawmakers raised concerns about communications between Russian leaders and Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX. Russian forces have also been illegally using Starlink terminals for military purposes in Ukraine, though Musk denied any sales of the equipment to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-leading-phone-operator-kyivstar-announces-new-satellite-agreement-with-starlink/	2024-12-30T07:04:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
US sends $3.4 billion in financial aid to Ukraine	The United States made a $3.4 billion payment in direct budget support to Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Dec. 30. The payment is the final portion of funds allocated under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act 2024, Yellen&apos;s statement read. &quot;Economic assistance from the United States and our allies is crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace by maintaining the critical government services that underpin its brave fight,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Our direct budget support continues to be conditioned on reforms related to strengthening law enforcement, improving transparency and efficiency of government institutions, and bolstering anti-corruption rules and procedures.&quot; Earlier in the day, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new $2.5 billion security assistance package for Ukraine. The latest security package includes immediate and long-term military support, including air defense systems, artillery, and other critical weaponry. The announcements come a few weeks before Biden&apos;s term ends, and Donald Trump becomes the new U.S. president. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid and $26 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine. Earlier in December, the U.S. announced the disbursement of $20 billion for Ukraine as part of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan covered by frozen Russian assets&apos; proceeds.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-sends-3-4-billion-in-direct-aid-to-ukraine-says-yellen/	2024-12-30T06:42:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251747231.jpg
Russian military suffers 427,000 casualties in 2024, Syrskyi claims	Russian forces have suffered around 427,000 soldiers killed or wounded this year, mainly in battles in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 30. &quot;Russia continues to carry out constant &apos;human wave&apos; assaults, suffering record losses. Last week, Russian forces have been losing around 1,700 people killed and wounded every day,&quot; Syrskyi said on Telegram after visiting units deployed in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces have been advancing at a rapid pace in late 2024, closing in on key Donetsk Oblast towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk, or Kurakhove at the cost of record losses. Heavy battles continue also in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Kyiv has warned about possible Russian advances in Ukraine&apos;s south. Ukraine claimed that Moscow&apos;s troops suffered their highest casualties in November and December, putting Russia&apos;s overall losses throughout the full-scale war at nearly 790,000 by the end of the year. The figures could not be independently verified. Moscow does not reveal the scale of its war losses but alleges they are lower than those of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, in addition to 370,000 injuries.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-suffers-427-000-casualties-in-2024-syrskyi-claims/	2024-12-30T06:27:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-30_15-05-58.jpg
Russia launched over 1,300 drone strikes, 250 missiles at Kyiv in 2024	Russia launched more than 1,300 drones and over 250 missiles of various types against Kyiv in 2024, Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, announced on Dec. 30. Throughout the year, the capital endured over 500 air raid alerts and nearly 200 airstrikes. Among the missiles targeting Kyiv were over 200 cruise missiles &#x2014; including Kh-101, Kh-59, Kh-69, Iskander-K, and Kalibr &#x2014; 24 ballistic missiles such as the Iskander-M and KN-23, 22 air-launched ballistic missiles, Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, and seven Zircon hypersonic missiles, according to Popko. &quot;These are terrifying numbers. But the most horrifying fact is that these rockets and drones killed our residents and destroyed our homes,&quot; Popko wrote on Telegram. Nearly 550 residential buildings in Kyiv were damaged by Russian attacks in 2024, leaving around 120 people homeless, Popko said. &quot;But the state will rebuild everything, ensuring housing for all, including Kyivans whose homes were destroyed by the aggressor and internally displaced Ukrainians who have made the capital their home,&quot; he added, noting that Kyiv saw an increase of nearly 11,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) over the past year. Energy infrastructure was also heavily targeted, forcing Kyiv residents to endure approximately 100 days of power outages, with daily blackouts averaging nine hours, according to Popko. &quot;Although Kyiv has officially not been considered a zone of potential hostilities for two years, the war &apos;reminds&apos; us of itself every day,&quot; he wrote. Earlier on Dec. 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 KAB guided bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks. Even on Christmas night, Russia organized a massive air attack,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing footage of the destruction across Ukraine. However, Popko ended his statement on a positive note, saying that in 2024, almost 21,000 babies were born in Kyiv hospitals. &quot;So, we all have something and someone to fight for!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-over-1-300-drone-strikes-250-missiles-at-kyiv-in-2024/	2024-12-30T05:45:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190102323.jpg
Biden announces $2.5 billion security assistance package for Ukraine	U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new security assistance package for Ukraine worth nearly $2.5 billion on Dec. 30. The package includes a $1.25 billion &quot;drawdown package&quot; of military equipment for Ukraine and $1.22 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), a Pentagon-led program that procures arms for Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. According to a White House statement, the resources will provide both immediate and long-term military support, including air defense systems, artillery, and other critical weaponry. &quot;As I committed earlier this year, the Department of Defense has now allocated all remaining USAI funds appropriated by Congress in the supplemental that I signed in April, and my Administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine,&quot; Biden said in the statement. &quot;I&#x2019;ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible &#x2014; including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,&quot; he added. The announcement comes just weeks before Donald Trump takes office next month. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine. According to the statement, the U.S. Department of Defense &quot;is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s hand as it heads into the winter.&quot; &quot;At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,&quot; Biden said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-announces-nearly-2-5-billion-in-security-assistance-for-ukraine/	2024-12-30T04:46:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174502892.jpg
US to send $15 billion to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, PM says	The United States will provide Ukraine with $15 billion, backed by future revenues from frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 30. The agreement was signed between Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry and the World Bank, Shmyhal said. &quot;These funds are part of the PEACE in Ukraine project and represent a portion of the $20 billion U.S. contribution under the G7 initiative, which will be allocated to social and humanitarian expenditures,&quot; Shmyhal wrote on Telegram. &quot;We thank the United States and the World Bank for implementing and supporting this initiative, which forces Russia to pay for its aggression against Ukraine,&quot; he added/ Shmyhal previously announced on Dec. 20 that Ukraine had already begun receiving U.S. funds under the framework of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan program, covered by profits from frozen Russian assets. On Dec. 24, Ukraine received $1 billion from the United States in profits from these assets, according to Shmyhal. Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in London condemned a similar plan by the U.K. to transfer more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, calling it a &quot;fraudulent scheme.&quot; The loans were agreed upon in July by G7 leaders &#x2014; comprising the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States &#x2014; along with senior European Union officials. The majority of the frozen Russian assets are held in EU countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-send-15-billion-to-ukraine-using-frozen-russian-assets-pm-says/	2024-12-30T03:48:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Ukraine's foreign minister meets with Syrian leadership in Damascus	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30, marking the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he held talks with Syria&#x2019;s de-facto leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa. The visit follows the collapse of the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8, amid a large-scale rebel offensive. &quot;This is the first visit of an official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in many years. It demonstrates our readiness to open a new chapter in bilateral relations with Syria,&quot; Sybiha said after the talks, according to a Foreign Ministry statement. He outlined plans for potential cooperation, including joint ventures, the establishment of industrial and food production, technology exchanges, and collaboration in cybersecurity and information protection. &quot;We also hope to see a greater share of Syrian goods in our imports,&quot; he added. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha meets the leaders of the Syrian administration in Damascus on Dec. 30. (Andrii Sybiha/X) During his visit, Sybiha also met with Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Asaad Hasan Al-Sheybani. Sybiha delivered a personal message from President Volodymyr Zelensky, pledging Ukraine&#x2019;s support for Syria&#x2019;s stability and recovery. Earlier on Dec. 27, Zelensky announced that Ukraine had sent 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria as part of its &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; initiative. &quot;This shipment will provide food for over 33,000 Syrian families&#x2014;or 167,000 Syrians&#x2014;for a month. It is a free humanitarian aid package, and it is only the first batch. We are prepared to deliver significantly more,&quot; Sybiha said. &quot;Ukraine remains a guarantor of food security, helping others even in times of war. This stands in stark contrast to Russia, which exports bombs, death, and destruction to Syria, while Ukraine exports flour, life, and recovery.&quot; The minister also highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s readiness to restore diplomatic ties, trade, and educational exchanges with Syria, contingent on Syria&#x2019;s respect for international law, including Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. He also announced that Ukraine is preparing to resume the education of Syrian students. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha meets the leaders of the Syrian administration in Damascus on Dec. 30.

Ukraine is ready to share its experience in collecting evidence, conducting investigations, and holding war criminals accountable for their actions,&quot; Sybiha said. &quot;We firmly believe that, in the long term, eliminating Russia&apos;s presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of Syria itself, as well as the entire Middle East and Africa&#x2014;even if it takes time.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-minister-meets-with-syrian-leadership-in-damascus/	2024-12-30T03:05:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/c0b8216d-4131-48f2-afb3-d4f1cbaf9098.jpg
Ukraine received over $41 billion in international aid in 2024, finance minister says	The Ukrainian Finance Ministry received $41.7 billion in international aid in 2024, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a televized statement on Dec. 30. The international aid helped Ukraine to ensure full social payments amid significant defense expenditures, he said. &quot;This year, we have already secured $41.7 billion in aid from our partners, which allowed us to fully fund pensions, salaries in the education and healthcare sectors, and the entire humanitarian-social system,&quot; Marchenko said. On Dec. 25, in response to Russia&apos;s mass attack on the country on Christmas Day, President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to &quot;continue its surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

Ukraine shot down 21 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukraine shot down 21 Russian attack drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force reported on Dec. 30. According to the report, Russia launched a total of 43 drones from its Krasnodar Krai region. The Air Force said it also lost track of the 22 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the attack ones. The drones were shot down over the Kharkiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Odesa, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions, the Air Force said. The debris from downed drones damaged residential houses in Kharkiv and Odesa oblasts, reads the report. Earlier in the day, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said that facades and roofs of five residential buildings were damaged in his oblast following the attack. No casualties have been reported. Over the past several months, Russia has intensified its drone attacks across Ukraine, often targeting critical infrastructure to deprive civilians of power, water, and gas. On Dec. 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 KAB-guided bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks.

Ukrainian FM urges EU to ban, replace Russian LNG imports	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European Union must be banned and replaced with supplies from the United States and other partners. &quot;There is enough LNG gas on the market to not fund the criminal Russian regime with its agression, war crimes, and hybrid attacks,&quot; Sybiha wrote on X on Dec. 29. Sybiha&#x2019;s statement came in response to a recent Financial Times report stating that Russian LNG imports to the EU &quot;reached a record high&quot; in 2024. According to the Financial Times, as of mid-December, the EU imported a record 16.5 million tonnes of Russian LNG, surpassing last year&#x2019;s total of 15.18 million tonnes. The report noted the amount also exceeded the previous record of 15.21 million tonnes imported in 2022, citing data from analytics firm Kpler. In his statement, Sybiha called the imports &quot;unacceptable&quot; and reiterated that they should be replaced with supplies from the U.S. and other partners. On Dec. 27, Ukraine received its first shipment of U.S. LNG, which arrived via a terminal in Greece. While LNG exports have faced fewer sanctions than oil, recent restrictions have begun tightening around the sector. In June, the EU imposed historic sanctions on the Russian gas industry, including its first ban on LNG transshipment. However, while some EU countries like Germany no longer import Russian LNG directly, the German state energy company SEFE has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s Yamal facility. The supplies from Yamal are routed to France before being fed into the European pipeline system. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen brought up the matter of Russian LNG in a phone conversation with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump shortly after his Nov. 5 victory. Von der Leyen said she floated the idea of replacing Russian LNG with more imports from the U.S. &quot;We still get a whole lot of LNG via Russia, from Russia,&quot; she said. &quot;And why not replace it with American LNG, which is cheaper, and brings down our energy prices?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-urges-eu-to-ban-replace-russian-lng-imports/	2024-12-29T23:17:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg

Black box from Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash sent to Brazil for investigation	The black box from the Azerbaijan Airlines crash in Kazakhstan, believed to have been caused by Russian air defense, is being sent to Brazil for investigation, Kazakh authorities reported on Dec. 29. Kazakhstan&#x2019;s decision aligns with Azerbaijan&apos;s call for a transparent probe into the crash, which killed 38 people. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. The government in Astana explained that the decision to send the flight recorders to Brazil was based on the fact that the Azal aircraft was manufactured there and followed &quot;consultations with Azerbaijan and Russia.&quot; &quot;In accordance with the standards of Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention, the state conducting the investigation ensures the reading of flight recorders and decides on the selection of a country to read and decode the black boxes,&quot; the statement said, highlighting that Kazakhstan is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Azerbaijan claims the aircraft was struck by a Russian missile near Grozny and denied emergency landings at two Russian airports before crashing. President Ilham Aliyev accused Russia of attempting to cover up the incident and demanded an apology, accountability for those responsible, and compensation. While Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized, he referred to the event as a &quot;tragic incident&quot; and did not admit guilt. The final conclusions about the crash will depend on the investigation of the flight recorders.	https://kyivindependent.com/black-box-from-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-crash-sent-to-brazil-for-investigation/	2024-12-29T21:23:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190840075.jpg
Slovak Defense Minister urges Ukraine to consider territorial concessions for 'war to stop immediately'	Slovak Defense Minister Robert Kalinak said that Ukraine may need to cede some territory due to the realities on the ground, Slovak news agency TASR reported on Dec. 29. During a television interview, Kalinak claimed that Slovakia&#x2019;s priority is for an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiations. While he stated that Russia is undeniably the aggressor in the conflict and has violated international law, he said that post-war stability is more important than its precise borders. &quot;Ukraine does not realize it will never find itself between Germany and Switzerland, but will always share its longest border with the Russian Federation,&quot; he said. &#x201C;It is important that, above all, people stop dying.&#x201D; Under Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. Fico also recently announced he had accepted the Kremlin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-defense-minister-urges-ukraine-to-consider-territorial-concessions-for-war-to-stop-immediately/	2024-12-29T18:25:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2153170450.jpg
Nordic, Baltic countries voice concerns about elections in Georgia, call for investigations	The Nordic Baltic Eight countries have urged Georgia to investigate and consider holding new elections following disputed parliamentary elections in October and the inauguration of the new president, according to their statement published on Dec. 29. The countries include Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Georgian anti-Western politician Mikheil Kavelashvili, an ally of the ruling Georgian Dream party, was inaugurated as the country&apos;s sixth president on Dec. 29 in a move seen as illegitimate by the opposition. The eight countries expressed concerns over reported irregularities during the elections, violence against peaceful demonstrators, and threats to Georgia&#x2019;s fifth and previous President Salome Zourabishvili, who disputes the legitimacy of the election results. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze emphasized the need to restore public confidence in Georgia&apos;s democratic institutions and called for implementing OSCE electoral recommendations as a step toward resolving the crisis. &#x201C;As long-standing friends of Georgia, and supporters of the European aspirations of the Georgian people, we are alarmed by the country&#x2019;s path toward deeper polarisation and crisis,&#x201D; the statement said. &#x201C;Georgia urgently needs a way out of the crisis, and to restore public trust in its democratic institutions.&#x201D; The statement condemned the use of intimidation and urged the Georgian authorities to take immediate action.	https://kyivindependent.com/nordic-baltic-countries-voice-concerns-about-elections-in-georgia-call-for-investigations/	2024-12-29T17:04:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188785036.jpg
Ukraine to appoint first Military Ombudsman, Zelensky says	A candidate for the new role of Military ombudsman has been chosen and will be revealed in a presidential decree on Dec. 30, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Dec. 29. Ukrainian officials first announced they would appoint a Military Ombudsman in April to ensure soldiers had a mechanism to report violations of their rights. The ombudsman &quot;will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of servicemen, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of servicemen and their family members,&quot; the Defense Ministry said after the announcement of the position in April. Calls for a military ombudsman have intensified in recent days following media reports of abuse in Ukraine&apos;s 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade, and have likely pushed authorities to swiftly appoint a military ombudsman. Senior Lieutenant Vladyslav Pastukh has been accused of abusing authority, beating, and humiliating subordinates, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Dec. 26. While, his godfather, Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk was detained on Dec. 29 for failing to address abuse and torture allegations involving his subordinates. &quot;There was a request from our military, and it is an objective necessity &#x2014; to create a special institution of a Military Ombudsman,&quot; Zelensky said on Dec. 29. &quot;We need a person who can effectively protect the rights of our warriors.&quot; The incidents stemming from the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade garnered widespread backlash following reports of abuse. In one of the alleged cases of abuse, Pastukh ordered subordinates to tie a victim to a wooden cross, where the soldier was immobilized for four hours. &quot;Together with the new commissioner, the human rights community, and the Ministry of Defense, we will draft a corresponding bill on the Military Ombudsman and establish the institutional framework for its operation,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that the work of the ombudsman will start shortly, likely in the new year. While the position of military ombudsman will be new to Ukraine, other militaries in Europe have long had an ombudsman to oversee the rights of military personnel, including Norway, Austria, Czechia, Belgium, and Sweden.	https://kyivindependent.com/military-ombudsman-to-be-appointed-soon-zelensky-says/	2024-12-29T13:59:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-8_13_53-PM.jpeg
16-year-old arrested in Russia over anti-government school poster	A 16-year-old girl is in pre-trial detention in St. Petersburg for putting up posters of anti-establishment fighters on a bulletin board at her school, a local court announced on Dec. 29. Russian authorities ramped up their crackdown on political opposition following the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Voicing discontent with Russia&apos;s war or Russian authorities can lead to heavy penalties. The child, who the Kyiv Independent has chosen not to identify, allegedly put up posters titled &quot;Heroes of Russia&quot; with photos of Denis Kapustin and Aleksiy Levkin on Dec. 26. Kapustin and Levkin are fighters in the Russian Volunteer Corps, a militant group established by Kapustin who has fought alongside Ukraine and opposes the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian authorities detained the accussed on Dec. 27, charging her with &quot;public calls for committing terrorist activities or public justification of terrorism.&quot; If convicted, Russian courts could impose hefty fines or several years in prison on her. According to the local court, the accused requested house arrest as she awaits trial. Nearly 20,000 people have been detained in Russia, including previous instances of child detentions, for alleged antiwar activities since the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022, Freedom House reports. Prominent Russian lawyer, Dmitry Talantov was sentenced to seven years in prison on Nov. 28 following his arrest in June 2022. Talantov was convicted of inciting hatred and spreading what Russian law enforcement called &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/16-year-old-arrested-in-russia-over-school-poster/	2024-12-29T12:37:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-2157284098-612x612.jpg
Latvia to transfer over 1,000 drones to Ukraine	Latvia will transfer over 1,000 &quot;combat drones of various types&quot; to Ukraine through the international drone coalition, the country&apos;s Defense Minister Andris Spruds announced on social media on Dec. 28. The drones, which are produced in Latvia, will be administered through the U.K. and Latvian-led drone coalition, which aims to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Latvia previously announced it will also provide an additional 20 million euros ($20.8 million) to the coalition in 2025. Together with Latvian &#x1F1F1;&#x1F1FB; drone manufacturers, we continue to support Ukraine &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;. The latest shipment, consisting of more than 1,000 combat drones of various types, has been prepared. The Drone Coalition is led by Latvia and Great Britain &#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7;. In 2025, Latvia will allocate another&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/lxCYCC3Ls7 Latvia, one of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest supporters, has committed to providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year and will provide thousands of drones. In August, the country pledged to provide 112 million euros ($126 million) in military support to Ukraine this year, in addition to helping expand the drone coalition initiative. Apart from the founding states, seven countries have joined the drone coalition, including Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Sweden, Estonia, and Denmark. The alliance previously planned to gather 1.8 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by the end of 2024 to support Ukraine. In November, the U.K., Germany, Canada, Luxembourg announced an additional $30 million for drone coalition funding. Ukraine is also working to scale up domestic production, aiming to produce at least 1 million drones in 2024. On Dec. 29, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Ukrainian drones accounted for over 96% of all UAVs used by the military in 2024. Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields and logistics, as well as oil refineries and depots.	https://kyivindependent.com/latvia-to-transfer-over-1-000-drones-to-ukraine/	2024-12-29T11:01:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Gf5w3mzWYAAbBVc.jpg
Poland prepared to increase energy exports to Ukraine in place of Slovakia, Bloomberg reports	Poland has expressed willingness to increase electricity exports to Ukraine if Slovakia halts its supply, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 29, citing an unnamed Polish official. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico threatened to stop electricity exports to Ukraine on Dec. 27, in response to Ukraine&apos;s decision to no longer transit Russian gas in 2025. Ukraine relies on energy imports from the EU amid Russian aerial attacks on energy infrastructure. &quot;If it is unavoidable, we will halt the electricity supplies that Ukraine needs during grid outages,&quot; Fico said in response to Ukraine&apos;s plans to no longer transit Russian gas on Dec. 27. Poland is ready to increase domestic electricity production if Slovakia halts the delivery of backup power supplies to Ukraine, an unnamed Polish official said, adding that the country is ready to compensate for any shortage that Ukraine&apos;s strained system would suffer from, the official said. Ukraine is a key transit route for Russian gas to reach the EU. While much of the EU has abandoned Russian gas, Slovakia has remained heavily reliant on Russian gas imports. Ukraine&apos;s contract to transit Russian gas expires on Dec. 31. Ukraine will not renew its contract, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19. &quot;It appears that Putin has ordered Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine, at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said on Dec. 28 in response to Fico&apos;s threats. Energy companies from Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia have called for the continued transit of Russian gas via Ukraine. EU sanctions have been reluctant to target Russian gas imports due to the bloc&apos;s reliance. The EU first imposed sanctions on Russian gas in June, over two years after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Fico&apos;s stance marks a shift from Slovakia&apos;s previous commitment to increase electricity supplies to Ukraine in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ready-to-help-ukraine-if-slovakias-fico-cuts-electric-grid/	2024-12-29T10:15:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1787208927.jpg
Ukraine War Latest: Ukraine prioritizing security guarantees over immediate NATO membership, senior diplomat says	Key developments on Dec. 28 - 29: Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO remains on the agenda but diplomatic efforts currently focus on obtaining strong security guarantees, Andrii Melnyk, Ukraine&#x2019;s newly-appointed envoy to the U.N., told Berliner Morgenpost on Dec. 27. Ukrainian officials have consistently presented NATO membership as the only way toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, though acknowledging that the entry itself is unlikely before a ceasefire. Melnyk emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s current focus is on securing robust guarantees for its defense rather than pursuing NATO membership in the immediate term. This comes as an apparent shift in rhetoric after the Foreign Ministry rejected any security guarantees that would substitute full membership in the alliance earlier this month. &quot;Our partners should carefully write down what military means they will use to defend Ukraine if Russia attacks again,&quot; Melnyk said, highlighting the need for guarantees beyond &quot;purely political promises&quot; like the Budapest Memorandum. Melnyk, who has held ambassadorial posts in Germany and Brazil, said these guarantees could take the form of bilateral or multilateral agreements with the EU and NATO countries and might also become part of a broader peace treaty with Russia. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons from the Soviet era in the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. The U.S. and Russia, among others, promised to recognize Ukraine&apos;s borders and ensure its security. Melnyk&apos;s comments come as Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations continue to face resistance from several member states, including Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary. Washington is also unlikely to be receptive, as members of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team have largely spoken out against a quick accession for Kyiv. Russia must admit responsibility for the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane after it was hit by fire from the ground over Russian territory, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said in a television interview on Dec. 29. Flight J2-8243 was flying from Azerbaijan&apos;s capital of Baku to Grozny in Chechnya before changing course and crashing in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, killing 38 people. Multiple reports and official statements indicated that Russian air defense fire was responsible for the disaster. &quot;We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia... We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,&quot; Aliyev said in the interview with the state-run Azerbaijan Television, accusing Russia of attempting to &quot;hush up&quot; the incident. &quot;Of course, the final version will be known after the black boxes are opened. But the initial versions are also well-founded and based on facts,&quot; the head of state added. &quot;And the facts are that the Azerbaijani civilian aircraft was damaged from the outside, over Russian territory, near the city of Grozny, and practically lost control. &quot;We also know that our aircraft was rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare,&quot; the Azerbaijani president said, adding that the tail section was seriously damaged as a result of fire from the ground. Aliyev further said that on Dec. 27, Baku delivered its list of demands to Russia, including an apology, an admission of responsibility, holding the perpetrators criminally responsible, and paying compensation to the Azerbaijani state and the affected passengers and crew members. &quot;These are our conditions. The first of them was already fulfilled yesterday. I hope that our other conditions will be accepted as well,&quot; Aliyev said in the interview, according to the Azerbaijan State News Agency. Putin, who has fostered close economic and political ties with Azerbaijan, called Aliyev on Dec. 28 to apologize &quot;for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace&quot; without commenting on whether the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. The Kremlin said that the plane made multiple attempts to land at Grozny airport during a Ukrainian drone attack, which was reportedly repelled by Russian air defenses. Western countries said the disaster was a result of Russia&apos;s &quot;reckless&quot; behavior and called for a transparent investigation. Putin and Aliyev held another phone call about the plane crash on Dec. 29, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, without revealing details. Ukraine has received over 150 million euros ($156 million) in funding from Denmark, France, and Lithuania to bolster its defense industry, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Dec. 29. The funds will support the production of long-range drones, missiles, and artillery, which are critical to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense strategy. These domestically produced weapons provide an alternative to Western arms, which often come with usage restrictions, and help address shortages of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Denmark contributed 111 million euros ($116 million) through agreements between Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the Strategic Industries Ministry, and the Danish Defense Ministry to strengthen the Armed Forces with advanced domestically made munitions. France provided a 29 million euros ($30 million) grant to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s security and defense capabilities. Lithuania allocated 10 million euros ($10.4 million) under a memorandum involving the Lithuanian and Ukrainian defense ministries and Ukraine&#x2019;s Strategic Industries Ministry to support the development of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. &quot;I thank our partners for their important support and contribution to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Umerov said. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced plans for Ukraine to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. The funding marks a significant step in boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s self-reliance in arms production as the war continues. Russia is dissatisfied with the reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s team, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29, according to state-owned TASS. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Lavrov said the proposal, as outlined in leaks and Trump&#x2019;s Dec. 12 Time interview, suggests &quot;freezing hostilities along the current line of contact and transferring the responsibility of confronting Russia to Europe.&quot; &quot;We are certainly not satisfied with the proposals sounding on behalf of representatives of the president-elect&apos;s team,&quot; Lavrov said, specifically rejecting the idea of introducing European peacekeepers in Ukraine. Reports suggest that Trump discussed these ideas during a Dec. 7 meeting in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump reportedly emphasized Europe&#x2019;s need to take the lead in deterring Russian aggression. Lavrov noted that Moscow has received no official signals from Washington regarding these proposals, adding that policy remains under the Biden administration until Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Lavrov expressed Russia&#x2019;s &quot;willingness to engage&quot; with the new U.S. administration, provided Washington takes the &quot;first move&quot; to restore dialogue severed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 that Russia aims to &quot;end the conflict&quot; in 2025 while reiterating hopes for a front-line success. Following Putin&apos;s comments, Lavrov ridiculed the possibility of a ceasefire, adding that &quot;a ceasefire is a road to nowhere.&quot; Putin expressed openness to dialogue with Trump but maintained Russia&#x2019;s firm demands, including no territorial concessions and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Trump&#x2019;s team has yet to outline officially any concrete steps for ending the war, despite his bold claims of achieving peace &quot;within 24 hours.&quot; Greece will provide Ukraine with 24 Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles to defend against ongoing Russian aerial attacks, the Greek news outlet Kathimerini reported on Dec. 28. Sea Sparrows are U.S.-made short-range missiles that can be launched from the sea or ground to intercept cruise missiles or aircraft. Ukraine received its first batch of Sea Sparrows from the U.S. in January 2023. Greece will send Ukraine Sea Sparrows from its naval and air force stockpiles that have been deemed unnecessary for the country&apos;s defense operations, Kathimerini reported. The missiles have reportedly been in use for 40 years. Athens has previously refused Kyiv&apos;s requests for certain air defense systems. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in April 2024 that he would not send Ukraine either Patriots or S-300 missile systems, due to Greece&apos;s own defense needs. The Sea Sparrow transfer will not decrease Greece&apos;s defense capabilities in the Aegean Sea, Kathimerini reported. Greece has supplied Ukraine with military assistance in the past, including BMP-1 armored vehicles, small arms, and ammunition. Greece has also agreed to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Mitsotakis and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement between Greece and Ukraine in October.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-51/	2024-12-29T09:54:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Fragmented financial oversight undermines Ukraine’s economic future	As a direct participant in the process of establishing the new regulatory framework, I wish to initiate a public debate on the biggest challenge facing Ukraine&#x2019;s financial services market: the lack of consistency in the institutional capacity of financial regulators &#x2014; an issue made more pressing by ongoing military challenges. In 2019, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, enacted a landmark reform, splitting the responsibilities of the National Commission for Regulation of Financial Services Markets between the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC). While the NBU was given additional powers over insurance, leasing, finance companies, and credit unions, the NSSMC was tasked with regulating non-state pension funds and construction financing. At the time, it was hoped the NSSMC would become a strong capital market regulator, yet five years later, concerns remain over its capabilities. In July 2023, NBU, the NSSMC, the Ukrainian finance ministry, and the Deposit Guarantee Fund approved the Financial Sector Development Strategy, focusing on war repudiation and reconstruction. Despite approval, a unified implementation roadmap is still lacking, mainly due to diverging visions between the NBU and NSSMC. The situation with investor protection highlights significant concerns. Two and a half years ago, Freedom Finance Ukraine, one of the largest brokers and depository institutions in the country, was sanctioned for activities threatening national security. Despite legislation barring sanctioned entities from participating in capital markets, the NSSMC only suspended the firm&#x2019;s license rather than revoking it. This decision left its clients &#x2014; mostly Ukrainian citizens holding about 800 million hryvnias ($19.2 million) in Ukrainian Eurobonds &#x2014; in a vulnerable position. They were unable to access their assets, sell their securities, or agree to the government&#x2019;s restructuring terms. Had the NSSMC allowed clients to consent to the restructuring through the firm&#x2019;s depository institution, they could have avoided significant losses. The decision to allow clients to receive new bonds came only on Aug. 23, by which point the 1.25% fee for participation had already passed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Ukrainian parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 28, 2022. (Ukrainian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Another example of inefficiency is the stalled expansion of Ukraine&apos;s link with the international central securities depository, Clearstream. In January 2023, the NBU and Clearstream announced plans to extend their existing partnership to include additional financial instruments for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction, such as debt securities for infrastructure projects. While the NBU swiftly updated the regulatory framework to implement the changes, the NSSMC delayed approval for months. Despite six months of discussion, the NSSMC failed to approve the amendments, offering no explanation for the delay. It wasn&#x2019;t until June 2024, after the International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s (IMF) intervention, that approval was granted. Additionally, the National Depository of Ukraine (NDU) presents a troubling conflict of interest. The NBU owns 25% of NDU, while the NSSMC controls the state&#x2019;s 25% share and supervises shares exceeding 5%. The NSSMC holds around 56% of the votes at shareholder meetings and is the sole regulator of the NDU. This conflict, identified by the IMF in 2018 and 2021, remains unaddressed. Moreover, recent amendments to Ukraine&#x2019;s capital markets law allow NSSMC officials to receive remuneration for their roles in overseeing capital market participants, further entrenching this conflict. Despite opposition, the NSSMC succeeded in pushing through these changes to benefit itself, demonstrating its political influence. A further example of the NSSMC&#x2019;s misalignment with government priorities is its handling of currency restrictions. According to the IMF&#x2019;s current memorandum, the NSSMC is tasked with imposing restrictions on securities accounts to prevent unproductive capital from leaving Ukraine. This responsibility is part of ensuring consistency between the regulations governing bank and securities accounts, with completion expected by December 2024. Given the ongoing war, it&#x2019;s critical to prevent capital flight and bolster foreign exchange reserves. However, despite knowing that securities are being used for transactions by its licensees, the NSSMC has not imposed any restrictions on such activities during martial law. In contrast, the NBU has prohibited banks from engaging in securities transactions, including swaps, since the full-scale Russian invasion began. In conclusion, the &#x201C;split&#x201D; regulatory model has proven problematic for Ukraine. Over the past five years, it has generated more issues than it has resolved. No regulatory body seems to be adequately protecting investors&apos; rights. The NSSMC, despite its mandate, has been largely inactive, while the NBU has limited powers in this area. Ukraine faces two distinct losses: the ongoing conflict and the active disenfranchisement of investors. This creates significant risks for Ukraine&#x2019;s financial system, including hindering reconstruction efforts, increasing borrowing costs, and eroding international investor confidence. It could also damage Ukraine&apos;s reputation with its partners and threaten the stability of the financial system. To address this, consolidating regulatory functions under a single, strong body &#x2014; such as the NBU &#x2014; should be considered to ensure a more effective approach.

Why is my life considered more important than a Ukrainian life?	Why is my life considered more important than a Ukrainian life? Why am I considered more important than the people I meet in Ukraine, who &#x2014; even in the darkest times &#x2014; still often extend such kindness and hospitality that you can&apos;t help but fall in love with this country? This isn&#x2019;t just an opinion; it&#x2019;s a fact beyond these borders, simply because I am not Ukrainian. Nights ago, I met with a friend. As we sat in a cafe on Kyiv&#x2019;s Khreshchatyk Street, the air raid sirens went off. It was hard not to think back to a conversation we had the week before: &#x201C;If we were killed by the same missile, my death would be news, but yours would only be a statistic.&#x201D; &#x201C;British man killed in Russian missile strike.&#x201D; &#x201C;British man killed in Kyiv named.&#x201D; Under both headlines, those around me, killed alongside me, would be nothing but a number in a footnote, if mentioned at all. In late-November, when the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a warning about a possible major Russian aerial attack, it made sure to &#x201C;encourage U.S. citizens to remain vigilant. No mention of the millions of Ukrainians who wouldn&#x2019;t think twice about helping someone else, no matter the circumstances. Indeed, last week when I was arriving in Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; just as the country was being attacked by over 200 missiles and drones &#x2014; it was a Ukrainian friend, hiding in a shelter in Kyiv, who told me to call them immediately if I needed help. When I speak to people back in the U.K., they tell me they&#x2019;ve seen the news over the past couple of weeks and urge me to leave. They seem shocked when I say that, no matter what happens, I won&#x2019;t just run away but will stay by those I care about here. Often, they can&#x2019;t understand why I would care about the friends I have in Ukraine, or why I&#x2019;d be friends with them at all. Or there&#x2019;s a sense that they believe I should value my Ukrainian friends less than those from elsewhere. It becomes hard to explain that, in many cases, the opposite is true.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)4o miniIt would be easy to dismiss this perception as merely a result of war and death being part of everyday life in Ukraine &#x2014; though that justification is morally wrong. But it&#x2019;s more than that. While the past three years have made a difference, it&#x2019;s undeniable that many in the West still have an unconscious ignorance toward Ukraine, especially its history. Few know that Kyiv thrived long before Moscow was even a muddy village, and fewer still agree that the war began long before Feb. 24, 2022. Perhaps this is what has led to the current situation, where the safety of the West and the lives of those living there are seen as more important than those of Ukrainians. As I write this, air alerts across Ukraine continue. Hours ago, I heard a loud explosion not far from where I am, and reports indicate further explosions in Kyiv and across the country. Millions are starting the day without power or heat in below-freezing temperatures. Major cities cannot operate their transport infrastructure, and houses, schools, hospitals, and more have been damaged, with countless lives torn apart. Children are traumatized once again. Meanwhile, less than 80 kilometers (50 miles) over the border in Poland, NATO forces in Rzeszow stand ready to protect Polish skies if any missile crosses the border. They have all the military equipment and resources to prevent further strikes in a country where NATO leaders have pledged to stand by and support, no matter what. But rather than acting, we see cowardice and an ongoing fear of provoking the provokers, agitating the agitators, and escalating a conflict against an aggressor who considers no price too high to achieve its imperialistic and genocidal ambitions. And why? Because in the West, Ukrainian lives are not as important as our own. If they were, political anger would not be raging over the decision to allow Ukraine to strike back with Western missiles, and that decision wouldn&#x2019;t have taken nearly 1,000 days to make. If they were, there would be no question about future support, and the gains made by Ukrainian forces two years ago would not have been lost. It&#x2019;s easy to dismiss this as a war between Russia and Ukraine, rather than a war between Russia and freedom, even in the face of mounting evidence of Russian attacks and interference in the West. But it takes either arrogance or blind ignorance to deny that it is the Ukrainian people who are doing and sacrificing the most &#x2014; not just for their own lives and freedoms, but also to protect those in the West who still live with the luxury of choosing to look the other way. When I speak to people in the West about Ukraine and the people I know here, they often ask, &#x201C;I support the Ukrainian people, but what should we actually do?&#x201D; The answer is simple: everything we can, but let&apos;s start by giving their lives the same value as our own.

Lavrov expressed Russia&#x2019;s &quot;willingness to engage&quot; with the new U.S. administration, provided Washington takes the &quot;first move&quot; to restore dialogue severed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 that Russia aims to &quot;end the conflict&quot; in 2025 while reiterating hopes for a front-line success. Following Putin&apos;s comments, Lavrov ridiculed the possibility of a ceasefire, adding that &quot;a ceasefire is a road to nowhere.&quot; Putin expressed openness to dialogue with Trump but maintained Russia&#x2019;s firm demands, including no territorial concessions and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Trump&#x2019;s team has yet to outline officially any concrete steps for ending the war, despite his bold claims of achieving peace &quot;within 24 hours.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-rejects-reported-peace-proposals-from-trumps-team/	2024-12-29T07:53:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Russian telecom equipment destroyed in occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's intel says	Four facilities housing telecommunication equipment for the illegal operator Phoenix, used by Russian forces, were destroyed in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 29. Without explicitly claiming responsibility, the agency said that &quot;disruptions to the Russian military&apos;s logistics and communications are an important continuous process.&quot; The Phoenix is a telecommunications operator active in the Russian-occupied part of Donetsk Oblast since 2015. HUR further reported that fires that melted cellular equipment in Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast and destroyed three railway relay cabinets in Yaroslavl Oblast disrupted Russian infrastructure. 0:00/1&#xD7;Destruction of Russian telecommunications equipment in the occupied territory of Donetsk Oblast, reported on Dec. 29.

Poland aims to fully fortify border with Belarus by mid-2025, senior official says	Poland plans to complete its fortified border wall and close the border with Belarus by next summer, aiming to curb what it sees as Russia&apos;s and Belarus&apos;s &quot;hybrid war&quot; through illegal migration, Polish Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk told the Financial Times on Dec. 29. The initiative follows strained relations between Poland and Belarus, a close ally of Russia, after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Warsaw has accused Belarus of orchestrating migrant flows into Poland to pressure the EU over sanctions, a claim Minsk denies. Additional reinforcements along the 400-kilometer (250 miles) eastern border include installing night vision cameras, thermal imagers, and a new patrol road, as well as strengthening the five-meter steel fence built in 2022. Poland is investing over 2.5 billion zlotys ($611 million) in the project, with half the funding allocated by the current government under Prime Minister Donald Tusk. &quot;This artificially created migration route will be closed during next summer, I hope and believe it,&quot; Duszczyk said. He added that once complete, the border&#x2019;s security would be &quot;as close to 100% as possible.&quot; Tensions escalated in May after a Polish border guard was critically injured by a migrant using a makeshift spear to breach the existing fence. In response, Tusk announced plans to create a 200-meter-wide buffer zone along the border with Belarus. Despite the border fortification, Duszczyk warned of potential attempts by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko to escalate tensions or sabotage Poland&#x2019;s infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-fortify-border-with-belarus-by-mid-2025/	2024-12-29T06:19:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1241656239.jpeg
Russia claims Ukrainian pilot surrendered in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine denies	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force on Dec. 29 denied claims spread by the Russian state media about a Ukrainian pilot surrendering to Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. The statement came after the Russian state news agency TASS claimed, citing Russian security services, that Ukrainian pilot Volodymyr Popovich had surrendered in the embattled Russian region. &quot;Unfortunately, cases of capture of military personnel who previously served in the Air Force do occur,&quot; the Air Force said in a statement. &quot;However, the information about the capture of a Ukrainian pilot is false. All Ukrainian pilots continue to perform tasks to protect the country.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Air Force did not provide further details nor name Popovich specifically. It is unclear whether the Air Force was refuting that Popovich was captured or that he was an active pilot at the time of his alleged capture. Training new pilots is a lengthy and expensive process, making aviators especially valuable personnel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-air-force-refutes-russian-claims-about-capturing-ukrainian-pilot/	2024-12-29T06:01:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1245920034-1.jpg
Ukraine secures over $156 million for defense industry from European allies, defense minister says	Ukraine has received over 150 million euros ($156 million) in funding from Denmark, France, and Lithuania to bolster its defense industry, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Dec. 29. The funds will support the production of long-range drones, missiles, and artillery, which are critical to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense strategy. These domestically produced weapons provide an alternative to Western arms, which often come with usage restrictions, and help address shortages of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Denmark contributed 111 million euros ($116 million) through agreements between Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the Strategic Industries Ministry, and the Danish Defense Ministry to strengthen the Armed Forces with advanced domestically made munitions. France provided a 29 million euros ($30 million) grant to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s security and defense capabilities. Lithuania allocated 10 million euros ($10.4 million) under a memorandum involving the Lithuanian and Ukrainian defense ministries and Ukraine&#x2019;s Strategic Industries Ministry to support the development of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. &quot;I thank our partners for their important support and contribution to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Umerov said. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced plans for Ukraine to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. The funding marks a significant step in boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s self-reliance in arms production as the war continues.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-over-150-million-for-defense-industry/	2024-12-29T05:34:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2451.jpg
Commander of Ukrainian engineering brigade charged with inaction over soldier abuse	Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation detained Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, commander of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade, on Dec. 29, accusing him of failing to address abuse and torture allegations involving his subordinates. The charges stem from a media investigation by Ukrainska Pravda on Dec. 16, which detailed severe abuse within the brigade. Officers reportedly beat service members, extorted money, and tied a soldier to a wooden cross as punishment. Following the revelations, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered an inspection and suspended Poberezhniuk, while Defense Minister Rustem Umerov launched an investigation into the abuse allegations. Investigators found that between February and July 2024, Poberezhniuk knew of repeated torture and inhumane treatment by Senior Lieutenant Vladyslav Pastukh, his godson and the son of the brigade&apos;s chief of staff. Pastukh, no longer serving in the unit, was previously implicated in the abuse cases. The media investigation revealed a pattern of nepotism in the brigade, with nearly a dozen instances of fathers and sons or husbands and wives serving together. Poberezhniuk has also been accused of misuse of resources under separate charges. He allegedly directed four subordinates to build his house in Khmelnytskyi Oblast in fall 2023 while falsely listing them as on duty in Mykolaiv Oblast. The soldiers reportedly received salaries and combat pay during the period. A court set bail at Hr 908,400 ($21,600), allowing his release on Dec. 20. After searches of Poberezhniuk&apos;s residence on Dec. 28, the officer was detained again and brought to Kyiv. Poberezhniuk faces charges of inaction of military authority under martial law, which carries a penalty of seven to 10 years in prison.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-ukrainian-brigade-charged-with-inaction-over-soldier-abuse/	2024-12-29T05:11:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-29_13-26-18.jpg
Child casualties in Ukraine within 9 months of 2024 surpass 2023 figures, UN reports	Child casualties in Ukraine during the first nine months of 2024 have exceeded the total for 2023, highlighting the devastating impact of the war on children, the U.N. Humanitarian Aid Organization for Children (UNICEF) said on Dec. 27. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and relocated to other Russian-controlled areas or Russia itself, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s national database. UNICEF reported that 2024 had been one of the worst years for children in conflict zones globally. A record 32,900 grave violations against 22,500 children were confirmed since 2023 &#x2014; the highest number since the U.N. began monitoring these violations nearly 20 years ago. &quot;By almost every measure, 2024 has been one of the worst years on record for children in conflict in UNICEF&#x2019;s history,&quot; said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. Russell added that children in conflict zones face heightened risks of being out of school, malnourished, or forcibly displaced. In Ukraine, as well as in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, and Sudan, millions of children have lost access to education due to damaged, destroyed, or repurposed schools. Globally, over 52 million children in conflict-affected regions are deprived of education, with many in Gaza and Sudan missing more than a year of school. Russia has conducted a &quot;systematic, intentional, and widespread&quot; program of forced adoption and Russification of deported Ukrainian children, according to a Yale School of Public Health study published on Dec. 3. Ukrainian children have been sent to at least 21 regions across Russia, subjected to pro-Russian re-education, and placed in Russian families. The war has claimed the lives of approximately 600 Ukrainian children, according to the Ukrainian database, with UNICEF predicting further increases in child victims in 2025 if the conflict continues unabated. &quot;This must not be the new normal. We cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world&#x2019;s unchecked wars,&quot; Russell said.	https://kyivindependent.com/child-casualties-in-ukraine-2024/	2024-12-29T04:32:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/4_Moskaliuk.jpg
Russia attacked Ukraine with over 280 bombs, 370 drones, 80 missiles this week, Zelensky says	Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 KAB guided bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 29. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks. Even on Christmas night, Russia organized a massive air attack,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing footage of the destruction across Ukraine. On Dec. 25, Russia conducted a large-scale attack, firing 78 missiles and 106 drones against multiple cities. Kharkiv came under &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, resulting in one death and six injuries. During the same attack, a Russian missile entered Moldovan airspace, Moldovan President Maia Sandu confirmed. Unverified reports claimed another missile entered Romanian airspace, though Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry denied any violation. Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to the missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. &quot;I am grateful to the defenders who save our people from daily attacks and to the partners who understand the importance of timely air defense to protect lives and bring a just and fair peace,&quot; Zelensky said. The president underscored the need for collective action, saying, &quot;Such terror can only be stopped with joint efforts.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacked-ukraine-with-over-280-kab-bombs-370-drones-80-missiles-this-week-zelensky-says/	2024-12-29T04:09:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-25_09-40-25.jpg
Crashed Azerbaijani airliner hit by live fire, electronic warfare over Russia, Azerbaijan's president says	An Azerbaijan Airlines plane was rendered &quot;uncontrollable&quot; by electronic warfare and damaged by fire from the ground while flying over Russia before crashing, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev told the media, the Trend News Agency reported on Dec. 29. Flight J2-8243 was flying from Azerbaijan&apos;s capital of Baku to Grozny in Chechnya before changing course and crashing in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, killing 38 people. Multiple reports and official statements indicated that Russian air defense fire was responsible for the disaster. &quot;Of course, the final version will be known after the black boxes are opened. But the initial versions are also well-founded and based on facts,&quot; Aliyev said in an interview with the state-run Azerbaijan Television. &quot;And the facts are that the Azerbaijani civilian aircraft was damaged from the outside, over Russian territory, near the city of Grozny, and practically lost control. &quot;We also know that our aircraft was rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare,&quot; the Azerbaijani president said, adding that the tail section was seriously damaged as a result of fire from the ground. Putin, who has fostered close economic and political ties with Azerbaijan, called Aliyev to apologize &quot;for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace&quot; without commenting on whether the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. The Kremlin said that the plane made multiple attempts to land at Grozny airport during a Ukrainian drone attack, which was reportedly repelled by Russian air defenses. Western countries said the disaster was a result of Russia&apos;s &quot;reckless&quot; behavior and called for a transparent investigation.	https://kyivindependent.com/aliyev-comments-on-airliner-crash/	2024-12-29T03:57:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/aliyev.jpg
Putin's apology over Azerbaijani plane crash 'apparent' admission of responsibility, Biden says	U.S. President Joe Biden said on Dec. 28 that Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s apology over a deadly Azerbaijan Airline crash appears to acknowledge Moscow&apos;s responsibility for the disaster. The plane was flying from Baku to Grozny in Russia&apos;s republic of Chechnya when it changed course and crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, killing 38 people. Azerbaijani officials reportedly believe that the aircraft was damaged by Russian air defenses while flying over Chechnya. In a rare move, Putin called his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, to apologize &quot;for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace&quot; without commenting on whether the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. Responding to a question on whether Putin should acknowledge responsibility, Biden responded: &quot;Apparently, he did, but I haven&apos;t spoken to him or my team.&quot; The White House said on Dec. 27 it saw signs of the airliner being shot down by Russian air defenses, while Azerbaijan&apos;s Transport Ministry said the plane was subjected to &quot;external interference&quot; as it attempted to land in Grozny. &quot;All (the survivors) without exception stated they heard three blast sounds when the aircraft was above Grozny,&quot; Azerbaijani Transport Minister Rashad Nabiyev said. The Kremlin said that the plane made multiple attempts to land at Grozny airport during a Ukrainian drone attack, which was reportedly repelled by Russian air defenses. The U.K. Foreign Office called for an investigation of the disaster while adding that Putin&apos;s apology &quot;fails to recognize that the reckless and irresponsible actions of the Russian State pose an acute and direct threat to the interests and national security of other states.&quot; In a separate incident in July 2014, a Russian Buk air defense system operated by Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), killing 283 passengers and 15 crew members.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-apology-over-azerbaijani-plane-crash-apparent-admission-of-responsbility-biden-says/	2024-12-29T03:33:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903922-1.jpg
Zelensky extends condolences over deadly South Korean plane crash	President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed condolences on Dec. 29 to the families of victims and the people of South Korea following a tragic Jeju Air plane crash that killed at least 176 people, marking the worst air disaster involving a South Korean airline in decades. The Jeju Air jetliner, carrying 175 passengers and six crew members, crash-landed at Muan International Airport in Muan County. Two crew members survived, while three individuals remain unaccounted for, according to local fire and rescue officials. &quot;Tragic news of a devastating Jeju Air accident at Muan International Airport in Muan County, Republic of Korea, claiming so many lives. Each life lost is an immeasurable tragedy,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&#x2019;s president expressed deep condolences to the families and the Korean people, as well as Acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok. &quot;We share your sorrow and stand with the Korean people in this time of grief,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-extends-condolences-over-deadly-south-korean-plane-crash/	2024-12-29T02:35:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2191061870.jpg
Russia may escalate hybrid warfare near NATO borders, Yermak warns	Russia may escalate its hybrid warfare tactics beyond sabotage of European infrastructure, potentially resorting to provocations on NATO&#x2019;s borders, Andriy Yermak, the head of the Presidential Office, warned in a Telegram post on Dec. 29. Nordic countries have been on high alert due to warnings from European intelligence agencies about potential Russian sabotage of power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipelines. On Dec. 25, the Estlink 2 power cable connecting Finland and Estonia was severely damaged in an incident investigated as a possible sabotage. Finnish authorities detained the vessel Eagle S, whose anchor reportedly caused the damage, and linked the ship to Russia&apos;s shadow fleet used to evade sanctions. Yermak expressed concern over the risks posed by Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet and unconventional threats involving North Korean or Iranian proxies. &quot;The appearance of North Korean troops dressed in Russian uniforms or Iranian proxies on the borders of NATO countries is quite realistic if Russia is not stopped now. The North Korean military is already fighting in Europe. Who could have thought of this before?&quot; he said. Yermak said that impunity for such actions could embolden further provocations. &quot;Impunity breeds permissiveness. This is the moment that requires strong decisions and strong actions.&quot; Earlier in 2023, Finland also investigated Russia&apos;s role in damaging an underwater gas pipeline, though Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the allegations as &quot;complete rubbish.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-escalate-hybrid-threats-to-nato-borders-yermak-warns/	2024-12-29T02:20:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2101222946.jpg
Ukraine prioritizing security guarantees over immediate NATO membership, senior diplomat says	Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO remains on the agenda but is not a top priority for diplomatic efforts, Andrii Melnyk, Ukraine&#x2019;s newly-appointed envoy to the U.N., told Berliner Morgenpost on Dec. 27. Ukrainian officials have consistently presented NATO membership as the only way toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, though acknowledging that the entry itself is unlikely before a ceasefire. Melnyk emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s current focus is on securing robust guarantees for its defense rather than pursuing NATO membership in the immediate term. This comes as an apparent shift in rhetoric after the Foreign Ministry rejected any security guarantees that would substitute full membership in the alliance earlier this month. &quot;Our partners should carefully write down what military means they will use to defend Ukraine if Russia attacks again,&quot; Melnyk said, highlighting the need for guarantees beyond &quot;purely political promises&quot; like the Budapest Memorandum. Melnyk, who has held ambassadorial posts in Germany and Brazil, said these guarantees could take the form of bilateral or multilateral agreements with the EU and NATO countries and might also become part of a broader peace treaty with Russia. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons from the Soviet era in the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. The U.S. and Russia, among others, promised to recognize Ukraine&apos;s borders and ensure its security. Melnyk&apos;s comments come as Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations continue to face resistance from several member states, including Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary. Washington is also unlikely to be receptive, as members of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team have largely spoken out against a quick accession for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-prioritizes-security-guarantees-melnyk-says/	2024-12-29T01:56:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russia could inflict 'substantial' casualties by unconventional attack against NATO, allied official says	There is a real possibility that Russia could inflict &quot;substantial&quot; casualties by carrying out arson or sabotage operation against a NATO country, NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General James Appathurai told Sky News in an interview published on Dec. 29. &quot;What really worries me is that one of these attacks, as I say, will break through in a big way,&quot; Appathurai said. Warnings about Russian hybrid attacks against allied countries have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. NATO pledged to step up security measures to counter hybrid attacks as the Finnish authorities recently seized the Eagle S tanker transporting Russian oil on suspicion it cut an undersea cable between Finland and Estonia. &quot;So there is a real prospect of one of these attacks causing substantial numbers of casualties or very substantial economic damage,&quot; the NATO official overseeing an updated allied strategy on countering hybrid attacks told Sky News. Appathurai said that the current volume of attacks would have been &quot;unacceptable&quot; five years ago, presenting it as Russia&apos;s response to the Western support for Kyiv. The official stressed that NATO must be clearer about what kind of an attack would trigger a joint response. NATO&apos;s Article 5 says that an attack against one ally represents an attack against the alliance as a whole and warrants a joint response. The application of this rule on Russian hybrid attacks has been hotly debated over the past few years. &quot;We can definitely count dozens. Up to 100 for sure. But then there&apos;s a lot of foiled plots,&quot; Appathurai said when talking about a surge in Russian kinetic hybrid attacks since 2022. These operations have not been limited to cutting cables, as Russian intelligence services have been connected to flammable parcels smuggled onto cargo planes and sent out to European airports.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-hybrid-attacks-nato/	2024-12-29T01:43:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1233390022.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 14 over past day	Russian forces launched multiple attacks across Ukraine, killing two civilians and injuring 14, regional authorities reported on Dec. 29. Overnight, Russia launched 10 drones from Crimea and six S-300/S-400 missiles from Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, targeting the Kursk and Sumy oblasts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian defenses shot down nine drones over Mykolaiv Oblast using anti-aircraft systems, electronic warfare, and mobile fire units. Kharkiv Oblast: There were no reported attacks on the Kharkiv city during the day. One civilian was killed by a drone munition drop in the village of Dvorichna, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces attacked the region six times. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed in the village of Kotlyne, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Kherson Oblast: Russian artillery struck Bilozerka, injuring 13 people, including two children, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Mykolaiv Oblast: Debris from downed drones caused fires in three outbuildings and a vacation home in a recreational area. The Chornomorsk community also came under attack, with debris setting fire to an administrative building at an energy facility. Rescuers quickly extinguished the blaze, and a 49-year-old worker was injured, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Zaporizhzhia Oblast: Russian forces launched 331 attacks on nine localities, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure. No civilian casualties were reported, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Sumy Oblast: Russia attacked border areas three times, recording four explosions. A first-person-view (FPV) drone strike on the Seredyna-Buda community damaged a car, local authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-4/	2024-12-29T01:04:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-29_06-00-21.jpg
Anti-Western Kavelashvili sworn in as Georgia's president, pro-EU Zourabichvili disputes legitimacy	Georgian anti-Western politician Mikheil Kavelashvili, an ally of the ruling Georgian Dream party, was inaugurated as the country&apos;s sixth president on Dec. 29 in a move seen as illegitimate by the opposition. Georgia&apos;s fifth president, Salome Zourabichvili, said she would vacate the presidential palace but stressed she remains the legitimate head of state, pledging to continue the struggle against the ruling party. Zourabichvili called Kavelashvili&apos;s election a &quot;mockery of democracy&quot; as the former football player was elected as the only candidate on the ballot by the new parliament seen as illegitimate by its opponents. The inauguration ceremony in the parliament building was attended by oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili but not by foreign diplomats, who were not invited due to alleged &quot;lack of space.&quot; Pro-EU Zourabichvili called upon the government&apos;s opponents to gather at the presidential palace to join yet another rally against the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party. Opposition parties said they would continue to recognize Zourabichvili as the legitimate president. The most recent waves of protests have been ongoing in the South Caucasus country since Georgian Dream claimed victory in the October parliamentary elections disputed by the opposition and international observers. The government stepped in with riot police and tear gas against the protesters and said that the country&apos;s EU accession process would be suspended at least until 2028 amid Western criticism. Speaking to citizens gathering at the Orbeliani Palace in Tbilisi, Zourabichvili called the ruling party &quot;locked up, scared, corrupt, illegitimate, unrecognized, subject to sanctions&quot; in an apparent reference to recent U.S. sanctions on Ivanishvili. Zourabichvili said that her loyalty to the Georgian people does not change based on whether she is inside or outside the presidential palace, adding: &quot;I will leave here with you and will be with you. I take with me legitimacy, the flag, your trust.&quot; Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze threatened Zourabichvili ahead of the inauguration by forcibly removing her and placing her in a &quot;correctional facility&quot; if she refused to leave the presidential seat voluntarily. Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, has been accused of undermining the country&apos;s democracy and dragging it into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit while derailing EU accession efforts. The ruling-party-backed foreign agents law, compared to similar repressive legislation in Russia, was adopted in May amid widespread criticism from international partners and mass protests at home.	https://kyivindependent.com/anti-western-kavelashvili-inaugurated-as-georgias-president/	2024-12-29T00:29:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/431540653_801582235120441_189950244604750563_n.jpg
German peacekeeping role in Ukraine hinges on Russia's consent, Merz says	Germany may consider joining a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine only with Russia&apos;s consent, Friedrich Merz, the opposition CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28, according to Die Zeit. His comments followed reports that the U.K. and France are discussing sending troops to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine, with similar proposals allegedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s peace plan. Merz noted that Germany&#x2019;s participation in peacekeeping operations requires a clear mandate under international law, emphasizing that Russia&apos;s agreement is essential. &quot;If a peace agreement is reached and Ukraine needs security guarantees, we can only discuss this if there is a clear mandate under international law. I don&#x2019;t see it at the moment. I would like such a mandate to be given in consensus with Russia, not in conflict,&quot; Merz said. Despite his criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for hesitancy in supporting Ukraine&#x2014;particularly regarding Taurus missiles &#x2014; Merz&#x2019;s stance on deploying troops aligns closely with Scholz&apos;s cautious approach. On Dec. 4, Merz described discussions about German troop deployment to ensure a ceasefire as &quot;irresponsible.&quot; Scholz has ruled out deploying German troops to Ukraine &quot;at this stage,&quot; citing an agreement with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Pistorius left the door open for potential future peacekeeping operations, saying, &quot;There are still too many unknowns.&quot; Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance leads in polls ahead of Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 elections, recently visited Kyiv, pledging a more assertive stance on arming Ukraine. His comments highlight ongoing debates within Germany about its role in post-war security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-peacekeeping-role-in-ukraine-hinges-on-russias-consent-merz-says/	2024-12-28T23:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Azerbaijan to change rules for temporary stay of Russian citizens	Azerbaijan will change the rules for the temporary stay of Russian citizens on its territory in the coming days after Russia announced stricter rules for the stay of foreigners, the Azerbaijan State News Agency reported on Dec. 28. &quot;As in all foreign policy issues... the Azerbaijani side will proceed in accordance with the principles of parity and reciprocity,&quot; Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ayhan Hajizade told the media when asked about Russia&apos;s new regulations. Russia previously announced that, as of Jan. 1, 2025, the temporary stay of foreign citizens without visas will be limited to 90 days within a calendar year instead of 90 days within 180 days. Foreigners will also be obliged to register at their destination within seven working days of crossing into Russia. Baku is considering these new rules from the perspective of the rights of Azerbaijani citizens, Hajizade said without revealing details of Azerbaijan&apos;s planned changes. Azerbaijan is one of the countries whose citizens can enter Russia for a limited time period without a visa. The two countries&apos; close economic and political ties are being tested after an Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed on Dec. 25 in Kazakhstan after allegedly coming under fire from Russian air defenses in Chechnya. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to apologize for the crash that killed 38 people without explicitly admitting responsibility.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-to-change-rules-for-temporary-stay-of-russian-citizens/	2024-12-28T23:34:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1089909744--1-.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 785,930 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 785,930 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 29. This number includes 1,730 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,656 tanks, 19,981 armored fighting vehicles, 32,410 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,450 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 21,038 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-785-930-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-28T23:13:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
US teacher in Russian prison declared wrongfully detained, Associated Press reports	The U.S. government has officially classified Marc Fogel, an American schoolteacher jailed in Russia on drug charges, as wrongfully detained, the State Department announced on Dec. 27. Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport for possessing marijuana, which his family and supporters say was prescribed for medical use. He is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence. Fogel&apos;s omission from a major prisoner exchange in August, which secured the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, led his family to push for stronger U.S. government efforts. His advocates urged the Biden administration to classify him as wrongfully detained, a move that typically increases diplomatic efforts to secure a detainee&#x2019;s release. The State Department confirmed that Fogel received the designation, explaining that the decision followed a review of factors, including whether his detention serves to influence U.S. policy or extract concessions from the government. &quot;The United States has been working to secure Marc Fogel&#x2019;s release for some time. We have long called for his humanitarian release and tried to include him in the Aug. 1 deal, but were unable to. The Secretary determined Marc was wrongfully detained in October,&quot; the department said, according to the Associated Press. The reason for the State Department&apos;s delay in announcing the designation remains unclear. With the designation, Fogel&#x2019;s case will now fall under the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, which focuses on negotiating the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad. In a statement, Fogel&#x2019;s wife, Jane, and his sons, Ethan and Sam, reportedly expressed gratitude for the designation. &quot;The State Department has finally acknowledged what we have known all along &#x2014; that our husband and father, Marc Fogel, has and continues to be wrongfully detained,&quot; they said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-teacher-in-russian-prison-declared-wrongfully-detained-associated-press-reports/	2024-12-28T20:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1985748928.jpg
Telegram blocks Russian state-owned media channels in several EU countries	A number of major Russian news outlets had their Telegram channels blocked across several European Union countries on Dec. 28. Users attempting to access these channels now see a notice saying that the content has been restricted and is no longer available. Restrictions apply to several Russian state-run or controlled media outlets, including RIA Novosti, Izvestia, Rossiya 1, Channel One, NTV, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Russia has waged a systematic international campaign of media manipulation and disinformation to justify its aggression against Ukraine and destabilize neighboring countries and the EU. These efforts target Ukraine and its citizens, as well as European political parties, civil society, and democratic institutions, with a focus on election interference and vulnerable groups. While it is not yet confirmed if the measures are enforced across the entire EU, the channels have reportedly been blocked in Poland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, and &#xA0;Czechia. The European Union has previously imposed measures targeting Russian media amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. In May, outlets like Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestia, and RIA Novosti were banned from broadcasting within the bloc. At the time, the EU Council said that these outlets played a crucial role in the war. &quot;These media outlets are under the permanent direct or indirect control of the leadership of the Russian Federation,&quot; read the statement. &quot;(They) have been essential and instrumental in bringing forward and supporting Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression against Ukraine and for the destabilization of its neighboring countries.&quot; Neither Telegram nor EU officials have issued statements about the latest restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/telegram-blocks-russian-state-owned-media-channels-in-eu/	2024-12-28T20:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1316489069.jpg
German FM warns of Russian 'shadow fleet' amid undersea cable incidents, calls for sanctions	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has raised concerns about Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; following recent damage to undersea cables across Europe. &quot;Almost every month, ships are currently damaging important undersea cables in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Baerbock told Germany&#x2019;s Funke media group on Dec. 28. She described suspicious activities by ship crews, including dropping anchors and dragging them along the seabed for kilometers without explanation. &quot;Ship crews lower anchors into the water, drag them for kilometers across the seabed for no apparent reason, and then lose them when they pull them up,&quot; she said. Baerbock expressed doubt that the string of incidents over recent months could be coincidental. &quot;This is an urgent wake-up call for all of us. In a digitalized world, undersea cables are the communication arteries that hold our world together,&quot; she stressed, urging stronger sanctions against Russia and increased investment in national security. Earlier this week, Finland reported damage to the Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia. Finnish authorities suspect sabotage and detained the oil tanker Eagle S, flagged under the Cook Islands. The European Union has linked the vessel to Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The shadow fleet refers to a network of ships allegedly used by Russia to bypass sanctions, such as those restricting oil sales. &quot;It is used by Russia to finance its illegal war of aggression in Ukraine,&quot; Baerbock explained. As of mid-December, over 50 ships from this fleet have faced EU sanctions. In a related event last month, two fiber-optic cables were severed in the Baltic Sea. Swedish investigators boarded a Chinese vessel as part of their probe into possible sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-warns-of-russian-shadow-fleet-amid-undersea-cable-incidents-calls-for-sanctions/	2024-12-28T17:43:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Oil spill in Black Sea sparks environmental emergency near Crimea	Russia has raised concerns over a major oil spill in the Black Sea after two tankers collided during a storm near occupied Crimea. The incident, which took place on Dec. 15 in the Kerch Strait, led to one tanker sinking and another running aground. Russia has declared a federal state of emergency on Dec. 26. Authorities estimate the tankers were carrying 9,200 tons of fuel oil, of which approximately 40% potentially leaked into the sea. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the crisis as &quot;truly critical&quot; and acknowledged the challenges in assessing the full scope of environmental damage. &quot;It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it,&quot; Peskov reportedly said, according to Russian media. President Vladimir Putin, earlier this month, referred to the spill as an &quot;ecological disaster.&quot; Thousands of volunteers have joined the clean-up effort, though some Russian scientists have criticized the response as inadequate. Russia&#x2019;s transport ministry announced on Dec. 28 that all affected areas had been cleaned, and no further pollution had been detected. However, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Aleksandr Kurenkov cautioned that the risk of additional leaks persists. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers poses significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-spill-in-black-sea-sparks-environmental-emergency-near-crimea/	2024-12-28T15:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1556040259.jpg
Ukrainian drones made up over 96% of UAVs military used in 2024, defense minister says	Ukrainian drones accounted for over 96% of all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used by the military in 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Dec. 28. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The drone industry &quot;reached unprecedented production volumes&quot; in 2024, Umerov said in a Facebook post. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all UAVs used by Ukrainian forces this year. Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones in 2024, Umerov said. Ukrainian enterprises also produced reconnaissance drones, kamikaze aircraft, copter-bombers, and long-range drones, he added. &quot;Such figures indicate a new level of efficiency in the interaction between the state and Ukrainian UAV manufacturers,&quot; Umerov said. President Volodoymyr Zelensky said in December 2023 that Ukraine aimed to produce one million drones in the coming year. In April 2024, Kyiv launched the Brave1 government initiative to invest in defense tech innovations. Ukraine in recent months has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-made-up-over-96-of-uavs-military-used-in-2024-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-28T13:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1701277083.jpg
Pro-Russian hackers launch cyberattack against Italy's Foreign Ministry, Milan airports	Hackers targeted the websites of the Italian Foreign Ministry and two airports in Milan on Dec. 28, Italy&apos;s cybersecurity agency (ACN) announced. The pro-Russian hacker group NoName057(16) claimed responsibility for the attacks on their Telegram channel. Starting from 8 a.m. local time on Dec. 28, denial of service (DDoS) attacks disrupted the foreign ministry website and the sites of the Milan-Malpensa and Milan-Linate airports, ACN reported. &#xA0;The websites had to shut down temporarily amid the attacks. The disruptions did not affect any flights, the agency said. The cyberattacks against the airports &quot;affected only the sites available to users, not the systems that regulate the flow of flights or even the apps or websites of the individual flight companies,&quot; according to ACN. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. &quot;Russophobes get a well-deserved cyber response,&quot; the hacker group NoName057(16) said in a Telegram post claiming responsibility for the attacks. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims. Pro-Russian hackers have attacked multiple targets throughout Europe since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ACN said. Thse groups aim to &quot;challenge &#xA0;Western countries&apos; support for Ukraine.&quot; Italy on Dec. 24 approved a decree extending military support to Ukraine through 2025. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-hackers-launch-cyberattack-against-italys-foreign-ministry-milan-airports/	2024-12-28T13:08:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1232039648.jpg
Putin names Ukraine main source of 'extremism' in new decree	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 28 signed a decree approving the updated &quot;Strategy for Combating Extremism in the Russian Federation,&quot; according to the country&apos;s official web portal. The new decree names Ukraine among the &quot;main sources of extremism&quot; and enshrines the concept of &quot;Russophobia&quot; for the first time. Russia&apos;s previous anti-extremism strategy, approved by Putin in 2020, did not include the term or single out Ukraine as a threat. The latest version of the document warns of &quot;serious threats&quot; from Ukraine and repeats Russian propaganda claims about the rise of neo-Nazi activity among Ukrainians. It alleges that radical armed groups receive support from &quot;external forces that encourage the commission of criminal acts on the territory of Russia.&quot; The document also outlines a definition of &quot;Russophobia,&quot; which it describes as &quot;an unfriendly, biased, hostile attitude towards Russian citizens, the Russian language and culture, expressed, among other things, in aggressive sentiments and actions on the part of individual representatives and political forces, as well as discriminatory actions on the part of the authorities of states unfriendly to Russia.&quot; Russia has used claims of &quot;extremism&quot; to crack down on a wide range of organizations, including news outlets, social media platforms, and what it calls &quot;the international LGBT social movement.&quot; Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced on Dec. 13 that it had blocked access to the Viber messaging app due to alleged violations of regulations combating terrorism and extremism. The Kremlin is also considering blocking WhatsApp, an app owned by Meta, a company labeled as an &quot;extremist organization&quot; in Russia. The Russian government designated a record 65 organizations as &quot;undesirable&quot; in 2024, exposing members and employees to criminal prosecution. Putin has intensified state repressions of dissent since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, arresting thousands of citizens accused of hate crimes and supporting &quot;extremist&quot; groups.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-names-ukraine-main-source-of-extremism-in-new-decree/	2024-12-28T12:13:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Ukraine receives 1st shipment of US LNG	Ukraine on Dec. 27 received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 28. The shipment reached Ukraine via an LNG terminal in Greece. &quot;This is not just a cargo &#x2014; it is a strategic step,&quot; Yermak said. &quot;Despite Russia&apos;s attempts to destroy our energy system during the war, we have won another victory on the energy front.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, signed a deal on LNG supplies with the U.S. firm Venture Global in June. The agreement marked the first time Ukraine purchased LNG from the U.S. DTEK accepted the first shipment, which contained approximately 100mn cubic meters worth of natural gas, at the Greek port on Dec. 27. The LNG will be re-gasified and exchanged throughout EU and Ukrainian gas networks. The company said it expects to receive similar cargoes in the future. &quot;The arrival of this LNG cargo is a clear signal of DTEK&apos;s determination to play its part in strengthening Ukraine and Europe&apos;s energy security,&quot; DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said. The arrival of the first U.S. LNG shipment comes just days before a deal to transit Russian gas to EU countries via Ukraine is set to expire. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested replacing Russian LNG supplies with exports from the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1st-shipment-of-us-lng/	2024-12-28T11:16:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1240455902.jpg
Russian shelling in Kherson Oblast injures 8, including 2 teens	Russia attacked the village of Bilozerka in Kherson Oblast with artillery on Dec. 28, injuring eight people, including two teenagers, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl sustained brain injuries and have been hospitalized, Prokudin said. The attack also wounded three men, aged 52, 51, and 21, and three women. Two of the women, aged 43 and 62, sustained brain injuries and contusions, Prokudin said. A third woman received shrapnel wounds to her arms. The victims have reportedly been hospitalized. Kherson and other regional settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River are subjected to daily Russian attacks as Russian troops remain in control across the river&apos;s east bank. Shelling in Bilozerka on Nov. 3 wounded a paramedic and an ambulance driver. Attacks in Kherson Oblast have reportedly increased in recent days, as Russian troops attempt to gain a foothold in the region. Ukraine&apos;s military said on Dec. 27 that it was repelling Russia&apos;s repeated attempts to land on an island in the Dnipro River delta. Ukraine has been anticipating a large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast as Russia pushes into the south.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shelling-in-kherson-oblast-injures-8-including-2-teens/	2024-12-28T10:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1822097784.jpg
Zelensky teases multiple 'important personnel decisions' coming soon	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 28 that his team is &quot;preparing several important personnel decisions&quot; that will be &quot;announced soon.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments followed meetings with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;We are preparing several important personnel decisions,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel the evening of Dec. 28. &quot;The decrees will be announced soon.&quot; Zelensky did not provide any further details on what departments or officials would be affected by the new decisions. Earlier this year, Zelensky launched a major government reshuffle, replacing key ministers and appointing a number of new advisors and deputies. In February 2024, Zelensky also replaced Ukraine&apos;s top military leadership, dismissing former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi and appointing Oleksandr Syrskyi in his place. Ukrainian media outlets reported in fall 2024 that Zelensky was considering dismissing Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov. The president has denied those reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-teases-multiple-important-personnel-decisions-coming-soon/	2024-12-28T09:57:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russia officially halts gas supplies to Moldova's Transnistria	The Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced on Dec. 28 that it is ending gas supplies to the Russian-occupied region of Transnistria in Moldova, effective Jan. 1, 2025. While a deal to allow Russian gas to flow to Moldova and other European countries via Ukraine expires at the end of the year, Gazprom said the decision was related to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not problems with transit. The Moldovogaz energy company &quot;regularly fails to fulfill its payment obligations,&quot; Gazprom claimed on Dec. 28. As a result, Gazprom is suspending natural gas supplies to Moldova. Transnistria is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Since 2022, the roughly 2 billion cubic meters of Gazprom gas flowing to Moldova per year have been used only by the Transnistria region, while the rest of the country has switched to European supplies. The looming expiration of the Ukraine gas transit agreement led the Moldovan government to declare a 60-day state of emergency beginning Dec. 16, due to fears of a &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; in Transnistria. Alternative transit routes are available for Moldova, however. Russian gas could reach the country via the TurkStream pipeline, flowing to Turkey and then through Bulgaria and Romania to Moldova. Gazprom has rejected this option. The company announced it was limiting gas supplies to Moldova to &quot;0 cubic meters per day,&quot; citing breach of contract rather than transit issues. Transnistria, a narrow territory at Moldova&apos;s eastern border with Ukraine, has been occupied by Russia since the early 1990s. Under the government of President Maia Sandu, the rest of Moldova has taken a pro-Western turn, launching EU accession talks in June and expelling dozens of suspected Russian spies. Chisinau has repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid campaigns against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-officially-halts-gas-supplies-to-moldovas-transnistria/	2024-12-28T09:24:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1787208927.jpg
Greece to deliver 24 Sea Sparrow missiles to Ukraine, media reports	Greece will provide Ukraine with 24 Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles to defend against ongoing Russian aerial attacks, the Greek news outlet Kathimerini reported on Dec. 28. Sea Sparrows are U.S.-made short-range missiles that can be launched from the sea or ground to intercept cruise missiles or aircraft. Ukraine received its first batch of Sea Sparrows from the U.S. in January 2023. Greece will send Ukraine Sea Sparrows from its naval and air force stockpiles that have been deemed unnecessary for the country&apos;s defense operations, Kathimerini reported. The missiles have reportedly been in use for 40 years. Athens has previously refused Kyiv&apos;s requests for certain air defense systems. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in April 2024 that he would not send Ukraine either Patriots or S-300 missile systems, due to Greece&apos;s own defense needs. The Sea Sparrow transfer will not decrease Greece&apos;s defense capabilities in the Aegean Sea, Kathimerini reported. Greece has supplied Ukraine with military assistance in the past, including BMP-1 armored vehicles, small arms, and ammunition. Greece has also agreed to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Mitsotakis and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement between Greece and Ukraine in October.	https://kyivindependent.com/greece-to-deliver-24-sea-sparrow-missiles-to-ukraine-media-reports/	2024-12-28T08:45:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-795390.jpg
How climate change threatens Christmas traditions in Ukrainian Hutsul region	IVANO-FRANKIVSK OBLAST &#x2014; Father Vasyl Diychuk, 41, shows the spot near the river where his village used to build an ice town on Epiphany, celebrated in January. A line of parked cars would stretch for several kilometers &#x2014; people from all over Ukraine and abroad came to Sokolivka to see the chapels, wells, and crosses, all made of ice. For the last three years, the village hasn&apos;t built its famous ice town &#x2014; the winters are so warm that there is nowhere to get ice. This winter, the chances for proper ice are also low. Snow and frost on winter holidays now come as a surprise to Ukrainians. Due to climate change, winters in Ukraine can feel like a very extended November. Instead of snowing, it&apos;s raining, and instead of ice, it&apos;s mud. In western Ukraine&#x2019;s Carpathian Mountains, the land of Hutsuls, where unique Christmas customs require cold weather, warm winters are a big change. The Hutsul region, in the mountainous southwestern part of Ukraine, is one of the country&#x2019;s most ethnographically vivid regions. Since it&#x2019;s difficult to get to, it has always been challenging for whatever state controlled the region to truly establish its rule in the area. New technologies have always reached it late. The Carpathians became part of the Soviet Union only after World War II, and even then, Ukrainian rebels continued to resist the Soviet regime for a decade, hiding in the mountains. Local traditions are also closely linked to Christianity, so the Hutsuls did not tolerate the atheistic Soviet government. &#x2018;In Soviet times, we used to carol secretly. If the authorities found out that you went carolling, you could be laid off&#x2019;, Ivan Zelenchuk, 70, a physicist and local historian from Kryvorivnia in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, says. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, traditions flourished again. Father Vasyl Diychuk conducts the Christmas Day service in the church in Sokolivka, a village in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)A man rings church bells in Kryvorivnya village, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 24, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)The most famous Hutsul tradition is koliada. Similar to the Western carol singing, it&#x2019;s a centuries-old custom when a group of singers goes to each home in their village, singing Christmas carols, greeting the birth of Jesus. The carolers sing briefly outside the house and then, if the family invites them for a festive dinner, they go inside and continue there. Ivan Zelenchuk recalls that when he was a child, koliada would always be accompanied by deep snow and severe frost. The weather of 30 degrees below zero Celsius (22 below zero Fahrenheit) was normal on Christmas. It was easy for carolers to lose their voices or catch a cold. &#x201C;It was so cold that sparrows would fall in flight,&#x201D; Zelenchuk recalls. The children also had a favorite winter pastime: throwing a cup of water into the air and watching it freeze before it reaches the ground. Rostyslav Havryliuk, a 19-year-old caroler from Kryvorivnya, shows his grandfather&apos;s festive vest (kuzhukh), which he wore to go carolling this year. It has a thick wool lining, so it is always warm in the frost. He says that nowadays tailors make vests much thinner, because usually there are no more strong frosts. For him, those severe winters are no more than a legend told by older people. More and more often, carolers go without sardaks, the Hutsul outerwear. Once, even carolers went barefoot because it was 10 degrees Celsius outside. Vasyl Tupyliuk, 70, a local historian from Krasnyk, another village in the Hutsul region, says that without snow and frost, the mood on Christmas isn&#x2019;t the same. When the snow falls, locals say that now it&#x2019;s a &#x201C;real Christmas.&#x201D; Carolers, dressed in traditional Hutsul clothes, celebrate Christmas in Kryvorivnya village, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)People gather for Christmas service in the church in Kryvorivnya village, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;If there&#x2019;s frost of 15 degrees below zero Celsius and snow up to the ankles, then the snow would hiss and the hatchets (part of a Hutsul costume) would glisten in the sun, and the carollers would rejoice,&#x201D; he says. When it rains on Christmas Day, Tupyliuk says, it&apos;s even easier to get sick than in cold weather, and traditional festive clothes, made from natural fibres and meant to be worn in subzero temperatures, get wet easily and could be damaged. For the last two years, Christmas in the Carpathians has been accompanied by rain, so carolers had to run from house to house. Add the local landscape to the mix: In Hutsul villages, most houses &#xA0;are on the slopes &#x2014; and a rainy Christmas means that carolers have to walk uphill in the mud. In recent years, koliada has begun to attract tourists to the area. Every year, thousands of people come to Kryvorivnia to watch the ritual. On Dec. 25, 2022, the first Christmas since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, a record 5,000 people gathered near the church in Kryvorivnia where the caroling begins. At that time, the local community was one of the first in Ukraine to switch to the Gregorian calendar and celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25, not Jan. 7, as it used to be in Ukraine for over 100 years. The rest of the Ukrainian Orthodox churches switched next year, in 2023. The rainy weather also makes tourists less likely to come, according to Ivan Rybaruk, a priest from Kryvorivnia. Viktor and Alina, a couple from Ivano-Frankivsk, came to Kryvorivnia for koliada this year because they knew it was snowing in the Carpathians. They say that if the weather had been rainy, they would have stayed home. &#x2018;Snow in the Carpathians is extremely important to us in winter. Without it, the holiday spirit fades&#x2019;, Viktor says. The change of weather is also impacting a key Christian tradition in the area. Hutsuls carve ice crosses on Epiphany, the day of Jesus&apos; baptism, celebrated now on Jan. 6. Every year on this day, a cross carved out of ice is placed in the spot where the priest blesses the water. First, a block of ice is cut out, then carefully placed on a sledge and taken to the place where the priest will bless the water. Once there, the block is hewn into a cross. Ivan Dzhelema, 58, a craftsman from Kryvorivnia who organizes the carving of the cross for Epiphany every year, has a pond near his house where he usually sources the ice. The pond is located right under a mountain, and is almost always in the shade. Still, for the pond to freeze well, the frost must last for at least a week. There are potholes in the ice &#x2014; the man goes to the pond to measure the thickness of the ice. On Christmas Eve, the ice in the pond was 12 centimetres thick. That should work: Anything more than 10 centimeters is fit for cross-making. But there&#x2019;s no guarantee the ice will hold until Epiphany.

(Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)The custom of carving crosses out of ice has a century-long continuity &#x2014; Dzhelema&#x2019;s father and grandfathers used to organize the cross carving for centuries. Over 30 years ago, the new tradition of ice towns was born in the local village of Sokolivka. In 1990, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, several men from Sokolivka gathered on the Rybnitsa River and carved not one, but three crosses, and the year after that &#x2014; three crosses and an altar table for them. Then it grew. Villagers liked the ice figures, so Sokolivka started making whole ice stories on Christian topics. Tourists started coming to Sokolivka to see the ice fairy tale, as they came to Kryvorivnia for koliada. If it was cold all winter, the ice town could last until March. Some neighboring villages were inspired by the Sokolivka example. In 2011, the village of Spas, on the eastern edge of the Hutsul region, launched its own ice sculpture festival on Epiphany, but had to stop in a few years &#x2014; the winters got warmer, and there wasn&#x2019;t enough ice. The organizer of the festival in Spas, Mykhailo Stovpiuk, 58, regrets that the village had to stop the festival, saying that in the 2010s it had huge success among tourists. With each passing decade, the winters became warmer and carvers had to get more creative. When the tradition started, Sokolivka&#x2019;s carvers were taking the ice from the local river, Rybnytsia. But it has halved in size since the 1990s, and began to freeze only mildly, so carvers started sourcing ice from ponds. Now even that doesn&#x2019;t always help. In the 2020s, winters became so warm that sometimes there is no ice at all. The temperature can stay at 5 degrees Celsius. In 2021, only one ice cross was made in Sokolivka, so carvers had to use birch for other decorations. The same happened in the next two winters. Another local village, Krasnyk, managed to make the traditional ice cross only once in the past 10 years, and had to switch to wood. Last year&apos;s wooden crosses still stand on the river banks both in Sokolivka and Kryvorivnia. That&#x2019;s also a manifestation of the changing weather. Dzhelema says that every year, in the spring, when the mountain rivers get overflown from the melting ice and snow, the stream would wash away the crosses, be they made from ice or wood. But in 2024, for the first time in Dzhelema&#x2019;s memory, there was no flood, and the cross remained standing. He blames global warming and fears what will become of the Hutsul winter traditions.

Every year, Dzhelema organizes the carving of ice crosses for Epiphany, an important local tradition. It&apos;s getting harder for him to source the ice. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)Three wooden crosses on the bank of the river in Sokolivka in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 23, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)Another thing is gone for locals: ice hockey. Dzhelema says that as a child, he would play ice hockey on the river. Elder Hutsuls say that in the 1960s, the local Cheremosh River used to freeze so well that one could drive a car between villages as if it were a road. Today, it sounds like fiction to Hutsul children. However, Hutsul priests are not afraid of the new climate. Father Ivan Rybaruk from Kryvorivnia says that climate change affects what the holiday looks like, but does not change its spirit. &#x201C;I was also surprised to see Santa Claus on the beach in Australia, but that&apos;s how people live,&#x201D; says Rybaruk. Father Vasyl from Sokolivka also says that when it comes to Christmas, people tend to pay more attention to the material than to the spiritual, but it should be the other way round. Many locals simply don&apos;t pay attention to the weather change because the Russian-Ukrainian war is a much more pressing issue for them. In Kryvorivnia alone, 13 men who used to be carolers were killed or went missing on the front. Many can&#x2019;t join the koliada tradition because they serve in the army. It has become a challenge to gather caroling groups. The war itself is accelerating climate change. The fighting and the intensified work of the defense industries increase carbon emissions. &#x201C;In the first two years of the full-scale war, additional emissions (in Ukraine) amounted to 175 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is more than the annual emissions of the Netherlands,&#x201D; says Bohdan Kuchenko, an ecologist from Ecodiya, a Ukrainian environmental NGO. The mix of war and climate shift is forcing the Hutsul traditions to change. The Hutsul carol tradition has pagan roots. The custom has survived the merger with Christianity, two world wars, and 45 years of Soviet repression. But mud and rain are testing the Hutsul traditions like never before.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-climate-change-influences-christmas/	2024-12-28T08:43:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/climate-crisis-15.jpg
Azerbaijan Airlines crash highlights Russia's failure to close airspace amid war	The Dec. 25 Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, likely caused by Russian air defense, shines light on a glaring issue the Kremlin has long swept under the rug. By unleashing its war against Ukraine, Russia has made its airspace a dangerous place. While Ukraine banned civilian flights over its territory hours before the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has limited itself to banning civilian flights over regions bordering Ukraine, as well as some regions not far from the Ukrainian border. Flights over the rest of Russian territory, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, are still allowed despite regular Ukrainian drone attacks deep into Russia. Airports in cities far from the Ukrainian border have faced only temporary restrictions. &quot;In my view, it&apos;s completely irresponsible that Russia&apos;s airspace is still open and that airlines continue to fly into them as part of routine flights,&quot; Fabian Hoffman, a defense policy expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Russia&apos;s airspace is an active war zone, similar to Ukraine&apos;s airspace. Any civilian flights should cease immediately.&quot; The Azerbaijan Airlines plane, which was carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed on Dec. 25 near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people died as a result of the crash. The crash was caused by a Russian surface-to-air missile, Reuters, Euronews and the Azeri media outlets Caliber.az and AnewZ reported, citing Azerbaijan&apos;s government sources. The reported use of air defense systems aligns with multiple media reports of air defense working in the region on the morning of Dec. 25. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the crash to his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on Dec. 28. Putin confirmed that the plane had tried to land in Grozny but the city was being attacked by Ukrainian drones, and Russian air defense was shooting them down.

(Mikhail Tereshchenko/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case into alleged violations of air safety rules. Azerbaijan Airlines said on Dec. 27 that the preliminary results of an Azeri investigation showed that the plane had suffered &quot;physical and technical external interference.&quot; Aliyev repeated this version in his Dec. 28 conversation with Putin. According to Azerbaijani government sources, the missile was fired from a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. Russian airports reportedly denied the plane permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan, located over 500 kilometers east on the opposite coast of the Caspian Sea. It is currently unknown why the plane was denied the right to land and diverted to an airport located hundreds of kilometers east. Some allege that Russian traffic control deliberately diverted the plane toward the sea, where a safe landing would be an extremely difficult task. Russia&#x2019;s state aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, said the plane was diverted to Aktau after a collision with a flock of birds. Following the accident, Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan&apos;s Qazaq Air, and Israel&apos;s El Al suspended their flights to Russia. If confirmed, it would not be the first time Russia downed a passenger plane during its war against Ukraine. On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by Russian forces in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, with all 298 people on board being killed.

(Bulent Kilic / AFP via Getty Images)Russian-controlled forces first celebrated the downing, yet later backtracked and deleted their statements when it was revealed that the plane was civilian. Russia continued to blame Ukraine, spreading fake narratives about Ukraine&apos;s air defense and the country&apos;s fighter jets being responsible for the downing. In one instance, Russian propaganda introduced a &quot;Spanish air traffic controller Carlos,&quot; who was described by Russian propaganda as seeing from &quot;Kyiv&apos;s control tower&quot; that the plane was downed by Ukrainian jets. A Dutch court has established that the plane was downed by a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile. Two Russians and one Ukrainian proxy working for Russia were convicted for the murder in absentia in 2022. The plane crash highlights a long-running problem. &quot;The airspace is now contested; that is, the Russian air defense system is shooting at Ukrainian missiles and drones flying across large parts of western Russia,&quot; Peter Layton, an aviation expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This situation will worsen and become even more confusing as Ukraine steps up the scale of the attacks and the variety of the missiles it is using. The result is a more dangerous airspace for civilian aircraft to operate in.&quot; Layton added that Russia is also &quot;jamming global positioning (GPS) systems used by civil airliners for navigation.&quot; &quot;This jamming is to thwart attacking Ukrainian missiles and drones,&quot; he said. &quot;There are manual procedures to work around this deliberate interference, but it adds to the difficulties and dangers of civilian aircraft operating in Russian airspace.&quot; Michael Harwood, another air power expert at the Royal United Services Institute, agreed, saying that &quot;for as long as the sovereign nation of Ukraine is attacked and occupied by forces directed by the Kremlin, nothing is safe in Russia.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), also argued that &quot;without any doubt, an ever more contested airspace through the use of unmanned aerial systems and missiles will lead to more accidents.&quot; &quot;The chance of human error will increase when air defenders are asked in a time-constrained environment to decide on target selection and firing approval,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;What does not help is that tactics designed to saturate the air defense systems intend to confuse systems and operators in order to influence the air defenders&apos; friend or foe identification process. More saturation means more decisions. More decisions means more mistakes.&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, argued that &quot;the question is what Russia will be able to do to improve its defenses and whether Ukraine will be able to keep up sufficient levels of production and innovation to stay ahead of Russia.&quot; According to international aviation customs, it&apos;s up to Russia to issue a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) and close its own airspace. Despite the danger posed by drone attacks and air defense, Russia has been reluctant to close its airspace, except for regions bordering Ukraine. Wolff and Hoffman said that regular Ukrainian drone attacks would be valid reasons for closing Russia&apos;s airspace. Hoffman added, however, that &quot;the Russian regime, of course, has a great incentive to keep its airspace relatively open in order to signal a sense of normalcy and control to the Russian public and international audiences.&quot; Stijnman also said that &quot;these developments increase the chance that restrictions may be deemed necessary in Russia.&quot; &quot;Ultimately, it is a decision based on a cost-benefit analysis by individual airlines and/or the Kremlin,&quot; he said. &quot;What are the (perceived) economic and societal costs of airspace restrictions versus the current state of affairs?&quot; Emergency services work at the crash site of an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane near Aktau, Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, 2024.

(Stringer / AFP via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Layton argued that &quot;Russia&apos;s large size makes air transport a very important means of travel.&quot; &quot;Combining that with the desire of the Russian government for civilian air operations to continue as normal, it is unlikely that parts of Russian airspace will be permanently closed,&quot; he added. &quot;On the other hand, short duration closures due to Ukrainian missile and drone attacks and Russian air defense responses may become increasingly common in airspace in western Russia and within, say, 750 kilometers of Ukraine.&quot; Apart from shining a spotlight on air safety, the Dec. 25 crash may also create problems for Russia&apos;s relations with Azerbaijan, from which the plane flew, and Kazakhstan, where it ended up crashing. &quot;Azerbaijan is asserting itself and has serious ambitions,&quot; Vadim Dubnov, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A state with such ambitions, as a regional leader, cannot afford to let such things (as the plane crash) slide.&quot; Dubnov also said that &quot;Azerbaijan leads the shortlist of countries that have learned to convert neutrality into benefits.&quot; &quot;It doesn&apos;t condemn Russia but maintains a certain level of decorum toward Ukraine,&quot; he added. &quot;Azerbaijan is using Russia and the current situation to strengthen itself and realize its own ambitions. The war helps it greatly, and Azerbaijan is exploiting it to the fullest.&quot; Dubnov said that during negotiations with Russia, Azerbaijan would likely recall that Baku apologized to Moscow after shooting down a Russian helicopter by mistake during the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh, a former Armenian-backed entity on Azeri territory. He also argued that &quot;for Russia, the situation is much more complicated&quot; since it is unlikely to directly admit that its air defense was responsible for the crash. &quot;(Russia) needs to acknowledge many things that it has never recognized before, which will also evoke numerous allusions, including comparisons to the Malaysian Boeing incident,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, it cannot afford to ruin relations with Azerbaijan, nor can it completely ignore Azerbaijan&apos;s demands.&quot; Dubnov said, however, that Russia and Azerbaijan would likely do their best to prevent their relations from deteriorating. &quot;Russia and Azerbaijan, as states that are quite similar in the style and aesthetics of their governance, understand each other&apos;s situations and difficulties,&quot; he said. &quot;They have time to find a formula that will satisfy both sides. However, it will be very difficult, especially for Russia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-airlines-crash-highlights-russias-failure-to-close-its-airspace-in-wartime/	2024-12-28T08:41:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749833.jpg
Top Russian-friendly politician resurfaces in Ukraine, emboldened by a chance of elections	A video published on TikTok by Yuriy Boyko, a pro-Russian lawmaker and former head of the banned Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, was met with public outrage in Ukraine. In his Dec. 14 video, Boyko repeated long-standing Russian propaganda points of radicals controlling Ukrainian streets. Sitting in his office and looking at the camera, Boyko said that alleged &quot;radicals&quot; in Ukraine &quot;started demolishing monuments, renaming towns, forbidding people to speak their native language&quot; and not allowing people to &quot;go to the church they want to go to.&quot; Yet, Boyko wasn&apos;t recording the video from Moscow, he was doing so from Kyiv. Despite three years of all-out war, the businessmen and politicians with strong ties to Moscow were able to keep their standing in Ukraine. &quot;Sometimes, I attend events organized by diplomatic missions of other countries. I regularly see Boyko there. And I always have the same question: why is he here and not in jail?&quot; politician and volunteer Serhiy Prytula said. As talks about potential elections in Ukraine are gaining momentum, the Russian-friendly group began to speak up. &quot;This is a statement that launches a political process. The question is which one and why now,&quot; Mykyta Poturayev, the chairman of the parliament&apos;s Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy, told the Kyiv Independent. After the public uproar, Boyko was questioned by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). He was also expelled from the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, yet only after the second try. In a subsequent video, the lawmaker apologized and called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Despite that, Boyko did not delete the previous video and continued to publish new ones, gaining tens of thousands of views. Following the failed first attempt to sack Boyko, political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko wrote that the pro-Russian lawmaker had &quot;friends or sympathizers&quot; in all factions and parliamentary groups. He called this the hidden side of politics, which involves informal relations. &quot;It should not come as a surprise that Yuriy Boyko and his political comrades felt and still feel good under different governments and presidents. They knew how to negotiate with everyone. And this is the secret of their political survival,&quot; Fesenko said. Boyko, 66, is a well-known face in Ukraine. An energy minister under pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych, Boyko ended his tenure in government as the country&apos;s deputy prime minister during the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted Yanukovych and his government. In 2011, a journalistic investigation revealed that Boyko was allegedly involved in a corruption scheme now bearing his name, which is thought to be one of the largest in Ukraine&apos;s history. The state-owned company Chornomornaftogaz, which was subordinated to Boyko&apos;s energy ministry, bought two oil rigs in the Black Sea through offshore companies. The state&apos;s losses from the purchase were estimated at $400 million. The rigs had been occupied by Russia since 2014. Kyiv regained control of them in the fall of 2023. Ukraine regained control of the state-owned company Chornomornaftogaz on Sep.11, 2023. (Telegram / Defence Intelligence of Ukraine)Before his tenure as minister. Boyko led Ukraine&apos;s Naftogaz, a state-owned oil and gas company, and was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for &quot;settling Ukraine&apos;s gas debt to Russia.&quot; With such a trail, it came as a surprise that Boyko did not flee in 2014, soon reinventing himself as one of the leaders of several pro-Russian political projects. Boyko advocated for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;neutrality and non-alignment&quot; and for granting the Russian language the status of the state language, proposals that echo Putin&apos;s ultimatums. Boyko ran for president in 2014 and 2019, coming in fourth place in the latter. Along with his tentative ally, pro-Kremlin businessman Viktor Medvedchuk, Boyko traveled to Moscow to meet with then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The two visited Russia again in a few months. The SBU launched investigations into the trips, but there were no further developments. Boyko was neither suspected nor charged. The joint political project of Boyko and Medvedchuk, Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, secured second place in the 2019 presidential elections with 13 percent of the vote and 44 seats.

(Yekaterina Shtukina/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)Following the start of the all-out war, Medvedchuk was arrested and sent to Russia amid a prisoner exchange. Boyko wasn&apos;t touched. On the third day of the full-scale invasion, when Russian troops were moving deeper into Ukraine, reaching the outskirts of Kyiv, Boyko was interviewed by Russian propaganda mouthpiece Vladimir Solovyov. The politician claimed that his faction and people were ready &quot;to do everything&quot; to start Ukraine-Russia talks as soon as possible. &quot;I did not think about leaving Ukraine at all. If you leave Ukraine, you put an end to your political career,&quot; he said later. As the war progressed, Boyko rebranded himself, disowning his pro-Russian associates who had not done so. He condemned Russia&apos;s aggression and supported Ukraine in restoring its 1991 borders. Oleksandr Salizhenko, editor in chief of the political watchdog Chesno, said Boyko had been careful following the EuroMaidan Revolution, yet he soon drifted back to an outright pro-Russian stance. &quot;It seems to me that the situation is now repeating itself, in terms of various indicators, voting, speeches, and the rhetoric of speeches (in parliament),&quot; Salizhenko said. In September 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court banned the Opposition Platform. Faction members attempted to rebrand themselves, splitting into two parliamentary groups &#x2014; Platform for Life and Peace and Restoring Ukraine. The first one is led by Boyko. &quot;This is a Russian party sitting in Ukraine&apos;s parliament,&quot; Mykola Davydiuk, a political observer, told the Kyiv Independent. Olena Shuliak, the head of the governing Servant of the People party, praised MPs from the banned pro-Russian party for &quot;very constructive&quot; cooperation with the ruling one, without elaborating on the terms. Pro-Russian Opposition Platform-For Life party leaders Viktor Medvedchuk and Yuriy Boyko give a speech at the party&apos;s election headquarters in Kyiv, Ukraine on July 21, 2019. (Vasily Maximov / AFP via Getty Images)Some lawmakers and experts suggest that the remnants of the pro-Russian groups in parliament help Zelensky&apos;s party stay afloat by voting for controversial bills in exchange for avoiding sanctions or criminal prosecutions. Yet, not all were saved from prosecution. A number of pro-Russian politicians are now either behind bars, fled Ukraine or ended up in Russia. According to Chesno, nine lawmakers from two parliamentary groups, successors of Opposition Platform, have been suspected of crimes against Ukraine&#x2019;s national security. According to Salizhenko, after the outbreak of full-scale war, the lawmakers of the former Opposition Platform changed their approach to voting. &quot;They are trying to demonstrate their usefulness to the authorities. They want to be counted on,&quot; he said. He also does not rule out that Boyko will be easier to control than a potential pro-Russian political newcomer. Publicly, Boyko said that his group supports Zelensky. Poturayev called the allegations of a deal between the ruling party and the Opposition Platform a &quot;manipulation.&quot; At the same time, according to the analysis of the Chesno, in 2022-2023, 86% of decisions could have been adopted without the votes from the former members of the Opposition Platform. Only 9.1% of initiatives could not have passed without their votes. &quot;The lawmakers of the former &apos;Opposition Platform&apos; do not vote with the majority when Russia has at least some interest in a particular issue. For example, on the ban of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP),&quot; said Salizhenko. They voted against the decision to dissolve the Kremlin-linked church, a number of priests of which were charged with treason for assisting Russia during the war. Even though Boyko&apos;s statement on TikTok was harshly criticized by many lawmakers and top officials, the parliament barely supported his expulsion from the Human Rights Committee, failing the first round of voting. Throughout the war, Boyko posted videos on his YouTube channel, as well as gave interviews to pro-Kremlin former journalists from TV channels linked to Medvedchuk, that were banned in 2021 for spreading disinformation and Kremlin&apos;s propaganda. However, the launch of his TikTok channel brought Boyko back into public space. Although the social media platform is used by many Ukrainian politicians, Boyko&apos;s video has sparked speculation that it could be a sign that he is doing groundwork for the post-war presidential and parliamentary run. The law does not allow Ukraine to hold elections during martial law. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&apos;s presidential office, said that presidential elections would be held &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war. Lawmaker Yuriy Boyko talks to the press after the morning extraordinary session of the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)After Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election this November, Kyiv has shifted its rhetoric on potential negotiations with Russia amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks. Despite multiple media reports about the preparations for elections, Poturayev denied that the ruling party is getting ready for the election. Salizhenko questions the assumptions about elections, saying that it is impossible to even organize them now. Over 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territories are occupied by Russia, with electoral infrastructure destroyed in multiple settlements in Ukraine-controlled territories. Additionally, there are over 6 million Ukrainians abroad and another 4.5 million internally displaced. &quot;These multiple problems simply mean that talks about elections are too early,&quot; he said. &quot;Politicians should talk about how we are going to solve these problems related to the elections, and not about how to hold these elections as soon as possible.&quot; Hello there!

Putin 'appears to have ordered Slovakia's Fico to open second energy front against Ukraine,' Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Slovakia&apos;s Prime Minister Robert Fico recent threats to cut off Ukraine&apos;s emergency power supply in the winter, saying that it appears he has been acting on Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s orders. &quot;It appears that Putin has ordered Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine, at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said, in a statement published via his official Telegram channel on Dec. 28. Zelensky said this was &quot;the only possible meaning&quot; of Fico&apos;s threats, that arrived amid Russian attacks on power plants and the distribution network. &quot;Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or orders from Moscow to Fico regarding electricity will not lead to a halt in electricity imports to Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said, because &quot;Slovakia is part of the single European energy market and Fico must respect pan-European rules.&quot; &quot;However, they could definitely lead to a break between the current Slovak government and the European community,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry also commented on the issue, stating on Dec. 28 that &quot;Slovakia&apos;s supply of critical amounts of electricity to Ukraine is not charity: Ukraine pays Slovakia a lot of money for it.&quot; &quot;By making senseless threats to cut off Ukraine&apos;s electricity, which it buys and does not receive as a gift, Prime Minister Robert Fico is actually siding with the Russian dictator,&quot; the statement said, noting that &quot;currently these are the only two figures in the world threatening to leave Ukrainians without electricity in winter,&quot; meaning Fico and Putin. Both statements follows Fico&apos;s declaration on Dec. 27 that his government would consider halting electricity supplies to Ukraine, after Kyiv announced it would not extend the deal on transit of Russian gas to Europe beyond Dec. 31. The Slovak president had held talks with Putin on Dec. 22 during a visit to Moscow, in which they discussed gas transit, the war in Ukraine, and standardizing &quot;mutual relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia. Despite EU efforts to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels amid the ongoing invasion, Slovakia, along with Hungary, remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates that alternative arrangements could cost an additional 220 million euros ($228.73 million) in transit fees.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ordered-slovakias-fico-to-open-a-second-energy-front-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-12-28T08:21:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ficoputin2-6.png
Russia will reach 1 million of killed and wounded soldiers in 2025, Latvian foreign minister says	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Francis Farrell sat down with Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze to look back at 2024 and discuss the country&#x2019;s support for Ukraine amid political uncertainty before the inauguration of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Russia&#x2019;s gains on the frontline.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-will-reach-1-million-of-killed-and-wounded-soldiers-in-2025-latvian-foreign-minister-says/	2024-12-28T07:59:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/IMG_20241227_193150_483.JPG
Putin apologizes to Azerbaijani president over plane crash, yet doesn't acknowledge Russia's responsibility	Russian President Vladimir Putin called the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to discuss the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash that killed 38 people, the Kremlin reported on Dec. 28. The Kremlin press service released a briefing detailing a call between Putin and Aliyev, during which the Russian president addressed some aspects of what he called a &quot;tragic accident.&quot; The briefing stated that the plane made multiple attempts to land at Grozny airport during a Ukrainian drone attack, which was reportedly repelled by Russian air defenses. The press statement did not address the claims that a Russian surface-to-air missile may have downed the Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Putin apologized for the fact that the &quot;tragic accident&quot; occurred in Russian airspace and &quot;expressed deep and sincere condolences to the families of the victims.&quot; He didn&apos;t acknowledge that it was Russia&apos;s fault. He also said that &quot;initial investigative actions&quot; were underway, and that two representatives of the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General&apos;s Office were in Grozny working with Russian authorities. Officials from Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan were also working together at the disaster site in the Aktau region, the briefing concluded. Shortly after this briefing was published, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on his Telegram channel that he also spoke to Aliyev over the phone about the crash, and said the key priority was &quot;to conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the truth about what happened.&quot; He also called on Russia to provide clear explanations, pointing to evidence from photos and videos showing &quot;damage to the aircraft&#x2019;s fuselage, including holes and dents,&quot; similar to those &quot;caused by an air defense missile strike.&quot; The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people died in the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-calls-azerbaijani-president-to-apologize/	2024-12-28T06:33:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903467.jpg
Russia suffered 421,000 casualties in 2024, 'highest price' since start of invasion, Syrskyi says	Russia has lost 421,000 troops in Ukraine in 2024, the &quot;highest price since the start of the invasion,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Telegram post on Dec. 28. The figure includes both dead and wounded and is part of the total losses of approximately 785,000 Russian troops since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Syrskyi, reporting on the outcomes of a meeting regarding the Armed Forces&apos; activities, said that the Ukrainian military was &quot;maintaining control over strategically important areas, securing the western part of the Black Sea, and weakening the enemy&apos;s military and industrial potential.&quot; He also said that the Armed Forces also established the Unmanned Systems Forces in 2024, which are &quot;necessary in the conditions of modern technological warfare.&quot; This branch is the first in the world to use unmanned aerial, surface, subsurface, and ground systems, as well as robotics, in combat operations. Syrskyi said that compared to 2023, the volume of deliveries of unmanned systems to Ukrainian units increased 19 times, and the number of enemy targets hit and destroyed increased 3.7 times. He also said that Ukraine has reduced Russia&apos;s military potential through &quot;DeepStrike means.&quot; DeepStrike, a long-range strike strategy, gained traction in 2024 when U.S. President Joe Biden authorized the use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory on Nov. 17, closely followed by the first use of British-made Storm Shadow missiles. Since then, Kyiv has intensified its campaign of strikes on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Syrskyi also said that a decision had been made to extend the terms of basic training of mobilized personnel. Such a decision was announced on Dec. 27, when Syrskyi himself said that Ukraine&apos;s military leadership planned to extend basic military training to two months in order to &quot;increase the readiness and safety of soldiers. The initiative followed consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and heads of individual combat units and is aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces as they continue to face intense hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-suffered-421-000-casualties-in-2024-highest-price-since-start-of-invasion-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-28T05:46:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Syrskyi.jpg
Russia detains suspect allegedly planning to assassinate defense official, pro-war blogger, Russian media report	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a Russian citizen who was allegedly preparing an attack on a Defense Ministry official and a popular pro-war blogger, Russian media reported on Dec. 28, citing a statement from FSB. The FSB claimed that the detained man was acting on instructions from Ukrainian intelligence, and had been allegedly communicating with them via Telegram. The man allegedly recovered a homemade explosive device with a capacity of about 1.5 kilograms of explosive &quot;disguised as a portable music speaker&quot; from a hideout in the Moscow region. According to the reports, the man was allegedly supposed to plant a bomb under the car of a &quot;famous blogger&quot; or under the gate of his house. He was also supposed to find the car of a high-ranking military officer in Moscow, which would then be mined. He also &quot;conducted reconnaissance activities&quot; at the residences of both the officer and the blogger, FSB claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine made no comments on the alleged operation. This news comes just days after the FSB detained four other Russians on Dec. 26 for allegedly preparing a series of attacks against senior Russian Defense Ministry officials and their families. They were also allegedly acting according to a Ukrainian plot with the aim to assassinate senior military officers. Both arrests followed the death of Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov at the hands of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which claimed responsibility, on Dec. 17. In this case, the suspect arrested by Russian law enforcement on Dec. 18 was a citizen of Uzbekistan who claimed to have been recruited by Ukrainian special services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-detains-suspect-allegedly-planning-to-assassinate-defense-officials-and-milblogger/	2024-12-28T04:13:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
New railway linking China to Central Asia countries, bypassing Russia, begins construction in Kyrgyzstan	Construction has begun on a new railway linking China to Central Asian countries Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov announced at the Dec. 27 groundbreaking ceremony. The new route, part of China&apos;s economic expansion efforts, aims to expand Chinese commercial influence in Central Asia and Europe while bypassing Russian territory. &quot;This route will ensure the supply of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan and then to Central Asia&quot; and other countries, including Turkey and the European Union, Japarov said in a press briefing, as quoted by the Kyrgyz Presidential Press Office. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway is &quot;not just a transport corridor&quot; but &quot;an important strategic bridge that will connect the countries of the East and the West,&quot; Japarov added. Japarov also said the project would &quot;strengthen regional ties&quot; and &quot;diversify transport routes,&quot; increasing the region&apos;s competitiveness as a transit hub. The railway will run nearly 523 kilometers (325 miles) west from the Chinese city of Kashgar in the northwestern region of Xinjiang through the Kyrgyz border city of Jalal-Abad to Andijan in Uzbekistan. The $8 billion project has been in talks since the 1990s, but economic and political pressure, particularly from Russia, which the road would bypass, had stalled it until now. The Kremlin&apos;s growing dependence on China in the wake of Western sanctions has apparently eased tensions, as hinted by Putin&apos;s participation in China&apos;s Belt and Road Forum in Oct. 2023, where this railway was highlighted as one of its projects. China officially declares itself a neutral party to Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine, but Washington has continued to sound the alarm on Beijing&apos;s support of Moscow&apos;s defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-railway-linking-china-to-europe-bypassing-russia-begins-construction-in-kyrgyzstan/	2024-12-28T03:18:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/11111.jpg
Ukraine destroys drone storage facility in Russia's Oryol Oblast, General Staff reports	The Ukrainian Air Force struck a military facility in Russia&apos;s western Oryol region, destroying a drone storage, maintenance and repair facility, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Facebook on Dec. 28. The General Staff said this combat operation &quot;significantly reduced the enemy&apos;s ability to carry out airstrikes using kamikaze drones against Ukraine&apos;s civilian infrastructure.&quot; The attack took place on Dec. 26 and targeted a Russian Defense Ministry military facility between the village of Tsimbulova and the village of Rudnevo in the Bolkhov district of Russia&apos;s Oryol region. Russian news outlet Astra claims that the facility was hit by three British-built Storm Shadow missiles, and that two people were killed and seven wounded in the attack. This information can&apos;t be independently verified. The Oryol region had seen another Ukrainian attack on Dec. 22, when drones targeted an oil depot and set it on fire. The same depot had been attacked just a week earlier, on Dec. 14, when Ukrainian drones caused a large fire to break out. The fire reportedly burned for several days after the attack. The General Staff said after that attack that the depot in the region was one of the largest oil product terminals in Russia and was &quot;part of the Russian military-industrial complex, supplying the Russian army with petroleum products.&quot; Ukraine first deployed the British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 20, just one day after also deploying U.S.-made long-range ATACMS for the first time. Since then, Kyiv has intensified its strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-drone-storage-facility-in-russias-oryol-oblast-general-staff-reports/	2024-12-28T02:15:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232-2.jpg
Russian airport suspends flights after Ukraine drone attack, official claims	The airport of the Russian city of Kazan suspended flights to &quot;ensure the safety of civilian aircraft flights,&quot; the press secretary of Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency Artem Korenyako reported on its Telegram channel on Dec. 28. Operations at the airport were suspended at 6 a.m. following a Ukrainian drone attack allegedly targeting the Russian regions of Voronezh, Rostov, and Belgorod, with Russian state media Tass reporting that 56 drones were shot down in total. This information can&apos;t be independently verified. &quot;To ensure the safety of flights of civil aircraft, temporary restrictions on the operation of Kazan airport have been introduced,&quot; Korenyako said. Such restrictions were lifted a few hours later. According to Korenyako, similar measures had been previously implemented and lifted on Dec. 27 in several Russian airports, including Kazan itself in Tatarstan region, Sochi in Krasnodar region, and Astrakhan in the namesake region. These restrictions come in the wake of the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane on Dec. 25, which may have been allegedly shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. The plane, which was carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan to Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. Several media reports speculated that Russian air defenses struck the plane during air defense operations against a Ukrainian drone attack in Chechnya on the same morning of Dec. 25. The same restriction were also implemented in the airports of Kazan and its neighboring city of Izhevsk after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings in the area on Dec. 21. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga. These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-airport-suspend-flights-after-ukraine-drone-attack-official-reports/	2024-12-28T01:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-990254422.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 784,200 troops in Ukraine since start of full-scale invasion	Russia has lost 784,200 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 28. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,651 tanks, 19,970 armored fighting vehicles, 32,328 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,408 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 21,013 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-784-200-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-27T23:09:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Ukraine plans to open over 150 underground schools by fall 2025	Ukraine plans to open over 150 underground educational facilities by September of 2025, Deputy Education Minister Nadiia Kuzmychova said at a briefing on Dec. 27. Ukraine&apos;s underground schools are a response to Russian aerial attacks, which regularly target civilian infrastructure, including education facilities. Ukraine has initiated plans to build 139 underground schools and several dozen underground vocational education institutions, Kuzmychova said at a Dec. 27 briefing, as reported by the news outlet Suspilne. There are currently 79 underground education facilities under active construction, she said. Construction is ongoing in front-line regions and areas most affected by Russian shelling. &quot;We expect the construction of absolutely all facilities to be completed by September 1, 2025,&quot; Kuzmychova said. Kharkiv was the first Ukrainian city to open schools underground to protect students from shelling and aerial attacks, while still offering in-person learning. The city operates schools in its metro stations. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has damaged one in every seven Ukrainian schools and completely destroyed over 400 educational institutions, the Education Ministry reported in February 2024. When the school year began in September 2024, Russian strikes damaged at least 12 education facilities in just three days, leading to dozens of casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-open-up-to-10-underground-schools-by-year-end/	2024-12-27T22:08:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190153231.jpg
North Korean troops suffer over 1,000 losses in Kursk Oblast in past week, White House official says	North Korean troops are experiencing mass casualties while fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27. The comments come a day after Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) on Dec. 26 reported that North Korean troops had suffered heavy losses in Kursk Oblast. The White House believes more than 1,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded over the past week alone, Kirby said in a press briefing. &quot;It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,&quot; he said. Kirby said that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect. North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture, Kirby added. &quot;I hope they&apos;re loading up their commanders with a bunch of body bags, because they&apos;re clearly going to need it,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since, in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-endure-mass-casualties-in-russias-war-against-ukraine-john-kirby-says/	2024-12-27T21:33:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1258328646.jpg
Ukrainian drones can hit targets 2,000 km away, military intelligence claims	Kyiv possesses drones capable of operating at a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers (roughly 1,243 miles), Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said on Dec. 27. While Ukraine does not always provide official comment on claims of drone strikes within Russia, Ukrainian drones have reportedly hit targets over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the front line. &quot;From what we can tell &#x2014; it&apos;s no longer a secret &#x2014; Ukrainian long-range unmanned aerial vehicles can hypothetically operate up to 2,000 kilometers,&quot; Yusov alleged in a television interview with the Ukrainian outlet News.LIVE. &quot;In most other cases, we neither confirm nor deny. I can only say that there is a reason for the explosions.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Yusov&apos;s claims. Yusov added that all Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target military and industrial facilities, rather than civilian infrastructure. Ukraine has recently championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year. Sources in HUR told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine was behind a drone attack against a Russian naval base in the Dagestan Republic on Nov. 6. The drone hit the port city of Kaspiysk, 1,000 kilometers from the front line. In May, a Ukrainian long-range drone reportedly struck a Russian radar system in Orsk, covering a distance of 1,800 kilometers (around 1,200 miles).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-can-hit-targets-2-000-km-away-military-intelligence-claims/	2024-12-27T21:08:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1252671748.jpg
US to send $1.25 billion in military aid to Ukraine, AP reports	The U.S. is planning to send $1.25 billion in military aid to Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 27, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The announcement is expected to come on Dec. 30, officials said. The outgoing White House administration has ramped up materiel shipments to Ukraine in the weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Previously, the U.S. announced $500 million in military aid for Ukraine on Dec. 12. The upcoming aid package is expected to include a substantial supply of munitions, officials told AP. This includes munitions for crucial air defense systems, such as the Hawk air defense system and the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). Stinger missiles and artillery rounds (105- and 155-mm) will also likely be provided, U.S. officials said. The promised air defense delivery comes as Ukraine faces intensifying Russian aerial attacks &#xA0;targeting critical energy infrastructure. Russia directed a mass missile and drone strike against Ukraine&apos;s power grid on Christmas morning, leading U.S. President Joe Biden to promise a &quot;surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Kyiv in response. Ukraine on Dec. 3 asked NATO countries for at least 20 air defense systems to repel Russian attacks. The situation on the ground is also &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;trending towards escalation,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 9. Russia has been making &#xA0;a series of territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, advancing in Donetsk Oblast and now attempting to shift its offensive into the south.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-send-1-25-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-on-monday/	2024-12-27T19:27:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768444.jpg
Drone strike damages railway line in Russia's Voronezh Oblast, governor claims	Debris from an intercepted drone damaged the contact network of a railway in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Dec. 28, regional Governor Alexander Gusev alleged. Russian air defense units downed over 10 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over Voronezh Oblast, Gusev said. Fragments from one of the drones struck the overhead contact system of a local railway. The damage resulted in the delay of at least one train, and ongoing delays are expected, Gusev said. Emergency services are currently at work on the scene. No casualties have been reported from the drone attack. The governor did not identify the district where damage occurred. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Gusev&apos;s claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Gusev alleged that a Ukrainian drone strike targeted two industrial facilities in Voronezh Oblast on Oct. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-damages-railway-line-in-russias-voronezh-oblast-governor-claims/	2024-12-27T18:48:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-971969650.jpg
Kyiv running out of ATACMS missiles, NYT reports	Ukraine&apos;s stockpiles of U.S.-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) are running low, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 27, citing senior U.S. officials. ATACMS are long-range ballistic missiles that can fly up to 300 kilometers (about 186 miles). The U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of ATACMS in November 2024, allowing Kyiv to launch them against military targets in Russia. Ukraine is now limiting these attacks due to a dwindling supply of the weapons and potential changes in U.S. policy, the NYT reported. Two senior U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the NYT that when U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv the green light to launch ATACMS into Russian territory, Ukraine likely had only about 50 of the missiles left in its arsenal. Following Biden&apos;s change in policy &#x2014;&#xA0;which was accompanied by permission from the U.K. to attack Russia with British long-range Storm Shadows &#x2014;&#xA0;Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian airfields, military facilities, and weapons factories. Ukraine has not publicly commented on these strikes, but the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that Kyiv has lanuched at least 31 ATACMS and 14 Storm Shadows since late November. Ukraine will not likely be able to replenish its missile stockpiles, the two U.S. officials said. Washington has already assigned its own limited arsenal of ATACMS to destinations in Asia and the Middle East. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also said he disagrees &quot;very vehemently&quot; with the decision to permit Ukrainian long-range strikes against Russia with American weapons. He may rescind permissions when he takes office in January 2025 and is not expected to increase missile shipments. Kyiv first began receiving an older, shorter-range model of ATACMS in fall of 2023. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. began shipping updated models with a range of up to 300 kilometers. &#xA0;At the time, Ukraine was only permitted to deploy these missiles against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. Despite persistent lobbying from President Volodymyr Zelensky to ease restrictions on long-range strikes, Biden delayed doing so out of fear of escalating conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes against Russia have not led to significant escalations thus far. The senior officials told the NYT that they believe Russia wants to avoid military escalation due to its recent battlefield gains and Trump&apos;s expected push for negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-running-out-of-atacms-missiles-nyt-reports/	2024-12-27T18:07:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/main.jpeg
Slovakia threatens to cut electricity supplies if Ukraine ends Russian gas transit	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced on Dec. 27 that his government will evaluate potential reciprocal measures against Ukraine, including halting electricity supplies, if Ukraine stops the transit of Russian gas to Slovakia after January 1. &#x201C;After Jan. 1, we will assess the situation and the possibilities of reciprocal measures against Ukraine,&#x201D; Fico said in a video address. &#x201C;If it is unavoidable, we will halt the electricity supplies that Ukraine needs during grid outages.&#x201D; He also said that halting gas transit through Ukraine would harm the EU&apos;s competitiveness. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. While the European Union has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, remain reliant on Russian gas. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. &#xA0; Since taking office, Fico has shifted Slovakia&#x2019;s foreign policy, halting military aid to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric more aligned with Russia, raising concerns among Kyiv and European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-supplies-if-ukraine-ends-russian-gas-transit/	2024-12-27T16:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Zelensky urges China to help stop North Korean military aid to Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky urged China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the frontline, during his evening address on Dec. 27. He emphasized the severe losses, in Kursk Oblast, that North Korean soldiers have faced thus far. &#x201C;They have many losses. Very many. And we see that the Russian military and North Korean overseers are not at all interested in their survival,&#x201D; he said. Zelensky described reports of North Korean soldiers being sent into poorly protected assaults by Russian forces and are sometimes even executed by their own people. He called the situation &#x201C;a manifestation of the madness that dictatorships are capable of&#x201D; and appealed to China. &#x201C;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&#x201D; Zelensky said. China has strengthened its ties with Russia since the beginning of its full-scale war against Ukraine. However, Beijing has denied allegations of aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. Since February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and again in May 2024. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-urges-china-to-help-stop-north-korean-military-aid-to-russia/	2024-12-27T13:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's new Oreshnik missile relies on Western manufacturing technology, FT reports	Key developments on Dec. 27: Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, recently fired at Ukraine, was developed using advanced manufacturing equipment from Western companies, despite sanctions, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 27. The missile, launched at Dnipro on Nov. 21, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&apos;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. Two key Russian weapons engineering institutes &#x2014; Moscow Institute for Thermal Technology (MITT) and Sozvezdie &#x2014; were named by Ukrainian intelligence as developers of the Oreshnik. According to the Financial Times, they posted job listings in 2024 that specified expertise in operating German and Japanese metalworking systems. The listings cited Fanuc (Japan), Siemens, and Haidenhein (both Germany) control systems for high-precision computer numerical control machines essential for missile production. Despite sanctions slowing the flow of such equipment, FT analysis found that at least $3 million worth of Heidenhain components were shipped into Russia in 2024, with some buyers closely tied to military production. Defense expert Fabian Hoffmann from the University of Oslo suggested the Oreshnik is not a wholly new development but rather a modification of the RS-26 Rubezh missile. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. The reliance on Western machinery points to continued vulnerabilities in Russia&apos;s defense industry amid ongoing sanctions aimed at curtailing its military capabilities. Three senior Russian officers have been killed in a Ukrainian strike using HIMARS and drones in an occupied area of Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 27. HUR said it obtained intelligence on a planned meeting of the Russian personnel, and along with the Unmanned Systems Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), formulated a plan of attack. Video released by HUR shows drone footage of several vehicles parked near a road. A large explosion is then followed by what appears to be the detonation of a cluster munition. The post accompanying the video says High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) were used in the initial attack, with strike drones later targeting an evacuation group. It did not state when the attack took place. According to HUR, the three Russian officers killed in the strike were Captain Nagorny Dmitry Olegovich, commander of the 1st battalion of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, Captain Krokhmalov Grigory Aleksandrovich, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, and Captain Fomin Yuri Viktorovich, commander of the anti-aircraft battery of the 4th Guards Military Base. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022. Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously. In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS &#x2013; fired from HIMARS launchers &#x2013; with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within. The weapons system is a multiple rocket launcher system mounted to a 6x6 FMTV truck chassis, providing devastating firepower launched from a highly mobile platform. Its rockets are radar-guided, with a range of around 70 kilometers (over 40 miles). When combined with high mobility, it is the ideal &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; system to target enemy weapons dumps and command posts. HIMARS success stories are too numerous to count, but in February they were used against a military training ground in occupied areas of Donetsk Oblast where Russian troops were stationed, killing at least 60, the BBC reported. A U.S. $725 million weapons package for Ukraine announced on Dec. 2 contained fresh supplies of HIMARS ammunition. Ukraine&apos;s military leadership plans to extend basic military training to two months to enhance the preparedness and safety of soldiers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Dec. 27. The initiative follows consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and leaders of individual combat units. &quot;We are currently working to create conditions for the training to last 2 months in total. High-quality training means, first and foremost, the preservation of the lives and health of our soldiers,&quot; Syrskyi said. He noted that recent graduates had completed a revised 1.5-month training course, an improvement from the previous 30-day standard. While an additional 5-14 days of training within military units is planned, intense battlefield conditions have sometimes limited this step. Syrskyi emphasized the importance of addressing training challenges and updating basic military training standards to meet current needs. These efforts complement broader reforms under General Mykhailo Drapatyi, appointed commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces on Dec. 12. Drapatyi&apos;s vision includes transforming the Ground Forces into an &quot;elite&quot; military unit by modernizing training programs, integrating advanced technology, and prioritizing social support for service members. In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. The planned changes aim to improve the effectiveness of Ukrainian forces as they continue to face intense hostilities. Russia has significantly increased the production of Shahed-136 drones and cheaper decoy drones at the Yelabuga drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, CNN reported on Dec. 27. This facility, located over 1,300 kilometers from the Ukraine border, plays a critical role in Moscow&apos;s drone manufacturing strategy. In 2023, the factory produced 2,738 Shahed-136-type drones, given the name Geran in Russia, with output more than doubling to 5,760 units in the first nine months of 2024. The facility also began serial production of &quot;Gerbera&quot; decoy drones, which mimic the radar signature of real Shaheds but are made from plywood and foam plastic. Russia plans to produce 10,000 Gerberas by the end of 2024, twice the number of Geran drones. Each Gerbera reportedly costs 10 times less to produce than a Geran. The production surge is facilitated by imports of components from China and the recruitment of low-skilled labor, including local teenagers and workers from Africa. The Alabuga Start project actively recruits African workers for the program, according to the report. Despite official statements of neutrality, China allegedly supplies drone components and technology through a network of 34 companies. Satellite imagery from March to September 2023 reportedly revealed a 55% increase in production space at the Alabuga site, along with enhanced facility security, including anti-drone cages and a fortified perimeter. The Yelabuga plant, launched in July 2023, manufactures a range of drones, including Shahed-type drones and reconnaissance models like the Albatross. Russia regularly employs drones and missiles to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The plant has faced disruptions, including from Ukrainian attacks. On Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported a fire at a Shahed warehouse in Alabuga, destroying $16 million worth of drone parts. In April, in an effort to counter Russia&apos;s expanding drone production, Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Yelabuga facility. Ukrainian troops have thwarted a Russian attempt to gain a foothold on one of its islands on the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on national TV on Dec. 27. &quot;Over the past day, (Russia) continued its attempts to land on Kozatsky Island, but was unsuccessful, suffered losses and was unable to land,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia had suffered &quot;losses in equipment, in particular, in boats, watercraft, and personnel.&quot; Voloshyn added that Russia suffered about 150 military losses as well as equipment, including two tanks, amid fighting in the region. Voloshyn&apos;s comments comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 that the region was &quot;observing an increase in enemy activity&quot; from sabotage groups, attempting to gain a foothold. On Dec. 26, Voloshyn said that the Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, and are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River in order to transfer firepower there. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russias-new-oreshnik-missile-relies-on-western-manufacturing-technology-ft-reports/	2024-12-27T11:39:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2071909815.jpg
US officials believe Ukraine may be forced to retreat from Kursk Oblast in spring, Bloomberg reports	U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, two U.S. officials told Bloomberg that it was their hope President Volodymyr Zelensky will retreat from Kursk Oblast in order to avoid suffering high casualties, amid an ongoing Russian offensive to retake the territory. Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, that Ukraine has lost over 40 per cent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to the counterattacks. Despite territorial losses, one U.S. official told Bloomberg that Ukraine has managed to hold onto the territory longer than expected amid President Joe Biden&apos;s approval for Kyiv to use fire long-range missiles into Russia. Another official told Bloomberg they believed the intention was never to hold on to Kursk for the long-term but to provide shock at Ukraine&apos;s ability to conduct the incursion. Zelensky said in September that Ukraine is planning to &quot;indefinitely&quot; hold the seized territories of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as it tries to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. In addition to the nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, approximately 12,000 North Korean soldier have begun fighting alongside Russian troops in the region. Both Russian and North Korean troops have sustained heavy casualties in the offensive. Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that over 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded thus far. Ukrainian officials have previously said that they intend to use Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk as leverage for possible peace negotiations following the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, with Ukrainian officials urging the incoming president to take a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach when dealing with negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-officials-believe-ukraine-may-be-forced-to-retreat-from-kursk-oblast-in-spring-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-27T11:36:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
2024: Ukraine in photos	The year 2024 was brutal for Ukraine. Last winter saw the fall of Avdiivka when, after several months of brutal fighting, the Russian army captured the city leveled to the ground. Ukraine struggled to hold the front line with limited resources as political infighting in the U.S. Congress had delayed the passing of a crucial aid bill for months. In spring, Russia renewed intense attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, damaging or destroying at least half of the country&apos;s energy capacities within months. It plunged most of the country into hours-long rolling blackouts for most of the summer. Russia made Iranian-supplied Shakhed drones and domestically manufactured UAVs the main strike force of its large-scale air attacks on Ukraine, which continued until the end of the year, despite the long-awaited F-16 fighter jets beginning to arrive in Ukraine in July. Russia indiscriminately attacked civilian infrastructure, among them the country&apos;s main children&apos;s hospital, Okhmatdyt in Kyiv, galvanizing the country into helping to clean up and rebuild it. On the front line, the residents of northern parts of Kharkiv Oblast, liberated in 2022, had their lives upended once again with Russia&apos;s new push towards the town of Vovchansk in May. As the fighting in the area continued for the rest of the year, 80% of buildings in Vovchansk were destroyed, displacing nearly 22.000 civilians from the area. Russia began to systematically kill Ukrainian POWs, with 109 confirmed killings this year. The months-long ongoing advance of Russian forces towards Pokrovsk in the east was briefly overshadowed by the stunning Ukrainian Kursk incursion in August. Several months later, however, Ukraine lost at least 40% of the territories it had taken. Kyiv continues to hold the remaining territory, now fighting against North Korean troops in the area, in an attempt to straighten its hand if peace talks with Russia begin in 2025. The neverending war turned military funerals into a daily routine, with Ukrainians mourning the loss of prominent figures like poet Maksym Kryvtsov, activist Pavlo Petrychenko, combat medic Iryna Tsybukh, and thousands more. Ukrainian people rejoiced at ten prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia over the year that brought home 1,159 people. However, peaceful rallies in the cities continued to remind us that Russia still holds around 8.000 military and roughly 28.000 civilians detained in brutal conditions. A rare glimpse of joy was the medals that athletes brought from the Paris Olympics 2024, where record-holder high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh won gold in August. In the fall, the country saw the biggest wartime government reshuffle and braced for what Donald Trump&apos;s win in the U.S. presidential elections could bring to Ukrainians in 2025. The Kyiv Independent partners up with the Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers to look back at some of the most memorable moments for Ukrainians in 2024 in photos.	https://kyivindependent.com/2025-ukraine-in-photos/	2024-12-27T11:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/6_danylo_pavlov.jpg
NATO to 'enhance military presence' in Baltic Sea following damage to undersea power cable, Rutte says	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Dec. 27 that &quot;NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea&quot; following the recent damage to the Estlink 2 power cable in the Gulf of Finland, likely caused by Russia. The comments made by Rutte on social media follow a conversation with Finnish President Alexander Stubb about the &quot;Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables.&quot; Finnish police announced in a press conference on Dec. 26 that recent damage to the cable in the Gulf of Finland was likely caused by a Russian tanker believed to be a part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to be seriously damaged on Christmas Day. Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible act of sabotage. Spoke w/ @alexstubb about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables. I expressed my full solidarity and support. #NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea. The ship likely belongs to Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, a group of vessels employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions, Finnish customs officials said. Investigators are still working to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. The anchor of the Russian vessel Eagle S appears to have caused the damage to the cable, authorities added. The Estlink 2 has remained offline since the incident and repair to the cable could take months, threatening the power supply in the winter season. The Finnish and Estonian governments are holding emergency meetings to assess the situation. Rutte did not provide details on how any &quot;enhance military presence&quot; may play out. A day earlier on Dec. 26, Rutte held a phone conversation with Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal and said that NATO stands &quot;ready to provide further support.&quot; Nordic countries have been on high alert due to increasing security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes, in Nordic countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-enhance-military-presence-in-baltic-sea-following-damage-to-undersea-power-cable-rutte-says/	2024-12-27T10:51:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187484276.jpg
Exposing the diamond industry — How Russia funds its war on Ukraine	While the diamond industry markets itself as a beacon of luxury, the complex web of global trade hides dark, brutal reality. Despite sanctions and growing scrutiny, Russian diamonds continue to enter the global market, funding Moscow&#x2019;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/exposing-the-diamond-industry-how-russia-funds-its-war-on-ukraine/	2024-12-27T10:24:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Diamonds-3_8.jpg
Ukraine receives $485 million in humanitarian aid from USAID, World Bank	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in coordination with the World Bank under the PEACE in Ukraine program, has delivered $485 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec. 27. According to Shmyhal, $465 million in humanitarian came from USAID, while a further $20 million was provided by the World Bank. &quot;The funds will be allocated to compensate for social and humanitarian expenditures in the state budget,&quot; Shmyhal said. The additional humanitarian funding comes as the the United States continues to expedite weapons and military aid deliveries ahead of the January inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid fears Trump would cut funding. On Dec. 25, in response to Russia&apos;s mass attack on the country on Christmas Day, President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to &quot;continue its surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Trump&#x2019;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, also criticized the assault, calling Christmas a &quot;time of peace.&quot; Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the World Bank has also continued to provide funding to support the Ukrainian government in implementing reforms that strengthen and stabilize the economy. On Dec. 18, the World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants to Ukraine, part of which is funded by a portion of the new U.S. $20 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-485-million-in-humanitarian-aid-from-usaid-world-bank/	2024-12-27T09:37:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1938968407.jpg
Fall of Assad’s regime disrupts Russian army recruitment in Syria	The collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria following a lightning rebel offensive in November has shaken Assad-ally Russia&#x2019;s near-decade of influence in the country. It has also had one other lesser-known consequence: disrupting Moscow&#x2019;s ability to recruit Syrian fighters for its war in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent spent several months analyzing Russian recruitment in Syria. We uncovered that Russia has been luring Syrians to fight in Ukraine from at least March 2022 to October 2024, not long before anti-regime rebels overtook the country in December . It&#x2019;s impossible to assess how many Syrians were recruited to fight against Ukraine. Different reports cite eyewitnesses who suggest that groups of recruits sent from Syria to Russia could number from 45 to 500 people. But what is known is that the recruitment campaign was systematic and involved many actors. According to the testimonies of Syrian recruits and their relatives, Russian recruiters often resorted to deception, to sign up fighters from Syria. It appears that recruited Syrians were frequently used in the Russian army&apos;s assault units, notorious for their blatant disregard for casualties. Ukraine&apos;s intelligence dossier on Russia&apos;s recruitment operations in Syria, provided to the Kyiv Independent by a source, suggests that Russia had an extensive network of recruitment. Some of the information in the dossier can&#x2019;t be independently verified. Other assessments can be confirmed through reports in independent media and testimonies recorded by human rights organizations. According to the dossier&#x2019;s Russia&#x2019;s recruitment network in Syria operated at different levels. First, Russia used the presence of its own regular army and related structures in Syria. This included the activities of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;reconciliation centers,&quot; set up allegedly to facilitate negotiations between the rebels and the Assad regime, as well as distribute humanitarian aid. In reality, the centers were used to spread Russian influence in Syria.

(Louai Beshara / AFP via Getty Images)It also helped that Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria had a wide network that included maintaining observation posts and conducting policing raids, under the cover of which Russians recruited Syrians to join the Russian army. Syrians were often promised &quot;work in the rear,&quot; such as guarding facilities, logistics, and medical support. They were offered tempting salaries by Syrian standards. Another arm of recruitment was the network of Syrian recruiters and organizations affiliated with the Kremlin-backed private military company Wagner Group. One of the best-known of these companies was the al-Sayyad Company for Guarding and Protection Services, also known as &quot;IS Hunters.&quot; In July 2022, al-Sayyad, along with its director, Fawaz Mikhail Gerges, and co-owner, Yasar Husein Ibrahim, were sanctioned by the EU over the company&#x2019;s activity &#x201C;in the recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to Libya and Ukraine&#x201D; and ties to the Assad regime. Both individual brokers and paramilitary &quot;private security companies&quot; affiliated with the Wagner Group were actively recruiting Syrians to serve in Libya before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, they began recruiting fighters for the war in Ukraine. Sanad Protection and Security Services was one of the companies actively recruiting Syrians. Sanad&#x2019;s owners, Ahmed Khalil and Nassser Deeb, as well as the company itself, were sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over its ties with Wagner, the Assad regime, and the recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to fight in Libya and Ukraine. After Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin&apos;s unsuccessful uprising in July 2023, the Russian Defense Ministry took control of Wagner&apos;s assets in Syria. Recruitment continued. Screenshot of Wagner mercenary group former boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the &quot;Razgruzka Vagnera&quot; Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)Some &#x201C;private security companies&#x201D; involved in recruiting Syrians for military service in Russia were nominally independent but affiliated with the Syrian regime through their owners&apos; business connections. One such company was ProGuard for Safety and Security Services LLC. The dossier claims that ProGuard was authorized by both Assad and the Russian military to recruit throughout all Assad-controlled territory of Syria in 2022-2023. One of the co-founders of ProGuard, Hashim Anwar al-Aqqad, was sanctioned by the EU back in 2014 over his ties with the Assad regime. The recruitment operation involved Russian citizens as well. One of the largest recruiting centers in Tartus, a major port in western Syria on the Mediterranean coast, was run by a Russian, identified in the Ukrainian intelligence as &#x201C;Colonel Vladimir Surdanov.&#x201D; He was allegedly assisted by a high-ranking officer from one of the regime&apos;s special services, and a brigadier general retired from the Assad regime&apos;s army. The dossier also claims that the regime&apos;s special services representatives were directly involved in recruitment. Local authorities allegedly also facilitated recruitment. The alleged location of Russian recruitment centers in Syria in 2022-2024, according to a dossier compiled by Ukrainian intelligence. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)According to the dossier, this was the case in most of the regime-controlled territories, including the cities of Latakia, Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, Damascus and the surrounding area, Rif Dimashq, Homs, Deir ez-Zor, and the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Independent Syrian media have also reported on the involvement of Assad&apos;s special services in recruitment. The reports mentioned that representatives of the General Intelligence Directorate, Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate also participated in signing up fighters. These agencies dealt mainly with internal issues in Assad-controlled territory. Members of the Baath party, the ruling party of the Assad regime, were also involved in recruitment, according to a report by Syrians for Truth and Justice, a human rights organization that recorded the testimonies of Syrians who tried to sign up. Among the recruitment efforts was a dedicated campaign targeting those who were already serving in the Syrian regime&apos;s army, as well as veterans. As early as March 2022, recruitment was actively advertised on forums and social media. In one case, an ad of &quot;Deployment to Ukraine&quot; was posted on a private social media group of the 4th Armored Division, led by Bashar al-Assad&apos;s younger brother Maher. In other cases, Syrian officers selected soldiers for &quot;trips to Ukraine&quot; at their discretion. Among the most active in seeking &quot;volunteers&quot; for the Russian army were the notorious Russian-backed 25th Special Mission Forces Division, also known as the Tiger Forces, the 16th Division, various units of the 5th Corps, and the Liwa al-Quds, also known as the Jerusalem Brigade, a unit of Palestinians who fought on the side of the Assad regime. Some reports by Syrian organizations also indicated that Russian leadership was sending &#x201C;Syrian mercenaries&#x201D; mostly affiliated with the Wagner Group that had earlier served in Libya or Syria to fight in Ukraine Wahid Mursel Al-Shibli, a young man in his twenties from the town of Ariqa in the As-Suwayda Governorate in southern Syria, was one of the Syrians who fell prey to those recruiting for the Russian army. According to Syrian independent media outlet Suwayda24, a local intermediary promised him &quot;work in the rear&quot; and a tempting salary. Al-Shibli and six other Syrians from the same region were sent to Russia in February 2024. Six months later, on Sept. 15, Al-Shibli&#x2019;s fellow Syrian soldiers informed his relatives that he had been killed in the fighting in Luhansk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. In May 2024, the independent media outlet Suwayda24 published an audio message from Al-Shibli to his uncle. &quot;They made me walk on this. I&apos;ve never walked over human corpses before,&quot; the man sounded exhausted and desperate. He described the horrors of the war in Ukraine and begged to be rescued and to be brought back to Syria. &quot;Scorched earth... It&apos;s something terrifying... Bodies in the middle. Burned trees, burned people... The situation is very bad here&#x2026; So I&#x2019;m begging you, as soon as you get this voice clip, act immediately. It has become a situation of life or death.&quot; Al-Shibli was killed within the next three months. According to what his relatives heard from his Syrian comrades, he was abandoned on the battlefield after being injured, with fellow soldiers saying he couldn&#x2019;t be evacuated.

(Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)His story is far from unique. An independent Syrian researcher Qalaat Al Mudiq has reported on the case of Ala Batal, a Syrian recruit who fought for Russia. His family told Al Mudiq that Batal had suffered from neglect in the Russian army. After his first injury, he didn&#x2019;t get proper treatment. Instead, he was sent back to the front lines, where he was later killed. His family in the Aleppo Governorate was not informed of his death until two months later. The family didn&#x2019;t get Batal&#x2019;s body back. All they have is a photo of his grave in an unnamed location, presumably in Russia. In the photo, there is a funeral wreath signed by the Russian Defense Ministry. One of the rare pieces of evidence of how Syrians are recruited into the Russian army is a video that was obtained and shared by an independent Syrian media outlet, Suwayda24, in January 2024. It shows a group of Syrian men posing with their new Russian passports and mobile phones. They are thanking &#x201C;Dr. Akram&#x201D; for helping them obtain the passports. It&#x2019;s not clear if &#x201C;Dr. Akram&#x201D; is the man filming the video. &quot;Within five days, he&apos;s become a Russian,&quot; the man behind the camera comments, pointing at one of the Syrians. &#x201C;And everyone bought a phone... And cigarettes... And may Allah keep you under his gaze.&quot; From open sources, we were able to find that &quot;Dr. Akram&quot; is one of the intermediaries and translators who was assisting Syrians and recruits from other Arabic-speaking countries in Russia. From local media reports, it appears that &quot;Dr. Akram&quot; worked with one of the most notorious recruiters, Wassim Fawaz al-Dimashqi, who previously worked for Wagner Group and recruited Syrians to Libya. Syrian media sources indicate that al-Dimashqi&apos;s activities were so reckless that he was even arrested by Assad&apos;s special services in March 2024 &quot;for forging travel documents.&quot; The Ukrainian intelligence dossier also points to al-Dimashqi as one of the most active recruiters in the As-Suwayda Governorate. In an audio message sent home by Syrian recruits, published by Lebanese-born journalist Wadei Al-Hayek in February 2024, a person identified as one of the Syrians recruited by Russia complains about being deceived by al-Dimashqi and his accomplices. &quot;We were sold to the Russian army...Wassim al-Dimashqi...is selling us,&#x201D; he is heard saying. &#x201C;We do not know the language here. We are signing papers and don&apos;t understand anything. The translator here has sold us out and has received dollars for us.&quot; The traces of Syrians in the Russian army are scarce and are sometimes found in unexpected places &#x2014; such as a propaganda video featuring a Russian military chaplain. One is a video published by one of the propaganda channels of Russian proxies in Ukraine in February 2024. It shows Archpriest Pyotr Gritsenko of the Russian Orthodox Church, who is identified as &quot;the Deputy Head Priest&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;Special Military Operation&#x201D; &#x2014; the official propaganda term for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. The caption says that &quot;50 Syrians have arrived to defend Donbas.&quot; To support this claim, the priest talks to an Arabic-speaking man in a Russian uniform, who calls himself Bassam Seed. He only introduces himself and says into the camera, &quot;Pray for me.&#x201D; According to a native speaker of Arabic that the Kyiv Independent showed the video to, the man has a Syrian accent but the phrase may indicate that he is Christian. In another video, Russians are giving out gloves as aid to foreigners identified as &quot;volunteers from Somalia, India, and Syria.&quot; The scene allegedly occurs during shooting practice at a &quot;rear training area.&quot; One of the men says he is from Syria and introduces himself as Hussein Muhammad. The video appears to seek to demonstrate that foreigners support Russia and join its war voluntarily, but doesn&#x2019;t touch upon how the foreign soldiers ended up in the Russian army, or why they had to rely on aid to get gloves. According to the Ukrainian intelligence dossier, in 2024, the Russian military command sent Syrians mainly to Donetsk Oblast and the Kharkiv axis. Syrian media and human rights activists also mentioned the presence of Syrian recruits in Luhansk Oblast. In 2022, there were also reports of Syrians being sent to Kherson Oblast. In some cases, they allegedly were to carry out &#x201C;guarding missions,&#x201D; not only partake in combat. Most of those recruited also received at least nominal training from Russian instructors. Basic military training allegedly took place in Syria. After that, according to the Ukrainian intelligence dossier, Syrian fighters received a basic course in the Russian language and practiced using various weapons at training fields in Russia. Rostov-on-Don, a city in southwestern Russia bordering the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, is most often cited as a place where Syrian recruits went through training or were temporarily stationed. Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod and Rostov oblasts, as well as Ukraine&#x2019;s partially occupied Luhansk Oblast, have also been mentioned. &#xA0; Sometimes, the path of Syrians recruited into the Russian army was more complicated and somewhat incoherent. Some were promised &quot;jobs&quot; far from the fighting (in eastern Siberia, for example). Victims of deception flew from Syria to Moscow or other Russian cities, where they boarded a plane to Yakutia in eastern Russia. There, the recruits received Russian passports and signed contracts (with the &quot;assistance&quot; of an Arabic-speaking translator provided by the recruiters).

(Valery Sharifulin/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Shortly thereafter, to the Syrians&apos; surprise, they were told that, according to the terms of the contracts, they would have to undergo training at one of the military training grounds in Buryatia in Russia&#x2019;s far east, or in the western part of Russia. Their next stop was combat units of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence dossier suggests that Syrian recruits in the Russian army in 2024 were often killed in action. Some ended up in the Russian airborne forces, often used as shock troops. The Kyiv Independent hasn&#x2019;t been able to find evidence that any Syrians who were recruited and fought in Ukraine managed to return home to Syria. How exactly did the recruited Syrians get to the front lines? The recruiters and their accomplices used various methods and routes. The Ukrainian intelligence&#x2019;s dossier shows that one of the most common methods was to bring recruits to the Khmeimim airbase in western Syria, operated by Russia. From there, they were allegedly transported by Russian military transport aircraft to Rostov-on-Don, a city in southwestern Russia. Another method mentioned in the dossier implied that recruited Syrians allegedly boarded Russian commercial cargo ships that were traveling between the regime-controlled ports and Russia. The dossiers mention three vessels that were allegedly involved in transporting Syrian recruits: &#xA0;Lady Maria, Baltic Leader, and Sparta IV, all of which are owned by Russian companies. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims about the first two independently. Vessels involved in illegal or sanctioned activities often disable their transponders so that their location or the ports they call at are not displayed in maritime traffic monitoring services. In the case of Sparta IV, however, Marine Traffic data shows that the vessel was at the port of Tartus in Syria several times between 2019 and 2023. In 2023, the captain of the Sparta IV, a Russian national Alexey Tereshchenko, was charged in absentia by the Security Service of Ukraine on suspicion of transporting military equipment from Syria to the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Syrian media and human rights organizations also describe cases of recruits being taken from Khmeimim to Mozdok, a city in the North Caucasus with a large number of military bases, or Moscow. There is also evidence that in 2022, Syrians who served in Libya boarded Cham Wings, a private Syrian airline owned by one of Assad&#x2019;s allies, to take flights from Benghazi to Damascus. They were allegedly flown from Damascus to Khmeimim, where Russian Tu-154s were sent out for Moscow. In one case, a plane carrying recruits allegedly took off from the outskirts of Homs for Russia in 2022. In another case, recruits from the Latakia, As-Suwayda, Aleppo and Homs Governorates boarded a civilian plane from the airport of Damascus to an airport in the Moscow region, according to Suwayda24. One group of soldiers from the 16th Division of the Assad regime&apos;s army headed to Ukraine had to make a connection, according to a report by Syrian human rights organization, Syrians for Truth and Justice. Mahan Air, a private Iranian airline sanctioned in the EU over transferring weapons and related technologies to Russia, took them from Aleppo to Tehran. From the Iranian capital, they flew to Moscow, and then were taken to a Russian-occupied town in Luhansk Oblast. The end of Assad&#x2019;s rule in Syria means that Moscow will not be able to recruit Syrians, at least in the near future. But Russia&#x2019;s predatory recruitment of foreign fighters does not end there. Evidence is mounting that the Kremlin maintains recruitment networks in post-Soviet countries and dozens of countries in South Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Recently, Russia has been reinforced by the addition of the North Korean troops. In December, reports emerged of North Korean soldiers being killed in large numbers in clashes with Ukrainian forces. As seen with fighters from Syria, the deaths of foreign recruits at the front appear to have little impact on Russia&apos;s broader recruitment efforts. Nizar Al Rifai has contributed to this report.

Construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia complete, Shmyhal says	The construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia and nearby settlements has been &quot;100% completed,&quot; Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec. 27. Ukraine has been building heavy fortifications near the city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region. Shmyhal said on social media that 1.9 billion hryvnias ($45.5 million) had been allocated from Ukraine&apos;s state budget to construct &quot;a total of 358 military strongpoints&quot; in the region, adding that &quot;hundreds of kilometers of defensive lines have been built.&quot; The construction of fortification comes amid warnings from Kyiv of a possible Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25 that Ukraine is tracking Russian troop movement in the southern region, and has observed &quot;existing threats.&quot; Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 11 that Russia could launch a renewed offensive on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Russia has also begun deploying assault groups to frontline positions in region, Voloshyn said. A renewed offensive into the region has not yet manifested, with Kostiantyn Denysov, Freedom of Russia Legion spokesperson, saying on Dec. 7 that the situation on the Zaporizhzhia front is becoming &quot;very difficult and tense,&quot; but the development was &quot;predicted.&quot; As Russia continues to advance elsewhere along the front line, the country&apos;s military is currently advancing at its fastest rate since 2022, according to analysts from the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Russia has repeatedly attacked settlements, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, with aerial weaponry since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/construction-of-fortifications-in-zaporizhzhia-fully-complete-shmyhal-says/	2024-12-27T08:15:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2107848216.jpg
Weapon' may have brought down Azerbaijan Airlines plane, Azerbaijan's transport minister says	Azerbaijani Transport Minister Rashad Nabiyev said on Dec. 27 that an Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan was due to &apos;external interference,&apos; with authorities investigating &quot;the type of weapon used in the interference.&quot; &quot;This is evidenced by the appearance of the aircraft debris on the ground and eyewitness accounts,&quot; Nabiyev said during a news conference, Azerbaijani media outlet Report reported. The plane, en route from Baku on Dec. 25, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. Initial reports suggest it could have been downed by a Russian surface-to-air missile. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Two passengers who survived the crash also heard a loud bang as the plane approached its original destination of Grozny, Reuters reported on Dec. 27. Kazakhstan&#x2019;s Transport Minister Marat Karabayev said on Dec. 26 that the plane had deviated from its course ahead of landing in Grozny. Online flight tracking website Flightradar24 said on social media that the plane was &quot;exposed to GPS jamming and spoofing near Grozny.&quot; &quot;The issue of turning off the GPS on board the plane also needs to be clarified,&quot; Nabiyev said. The comments by Nabiyev appear to be the first public acknowledgements made by Azerbaijani officials that a weapon was involved in the crash. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Nabiyev&apos;s conclusions align with those of Azerbaijan Airlines who said on Dec. 27 that &quot;physical and technical external interference&quot; led to the crash. The airline added that it was suspending flights to eight different locations within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/weapon-brought-down-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-azerbaijan-transport-minister-says/	2024-12-27T07:30:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 6	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 6 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 16-Dec. 22, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukrainian Parliament made a first step toward establishing consolidated public investment fund The Verkhovna Rada has approved, in its first of two readings, draft law #12245, which introduces amendments to the Budget Code aimed at improving public investment allocation aligned with the relevant International Monetary Fund&apos;s structural benchmark. The reform establishes a unified public investment fund to consolidate funds previously allocated across multiple programs, including infrastructure, environmental management, and energy efficiency. This fund will be managed by the Strategic Investment Council under the Cabinet of Ministers. Ukrainian authorities miss structural benchmark deadline Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, removed the controversial anti-journalist bill (#10242) from its agenda, effectively delaying its progress. However, the Law-Enforcement Committee had incorporated amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code into this draft law, aimed at meeting a structural benchmark to address issues arising from the expiration of pre-trial investigation time limits. With no additional parliamentary sessions scheduled for the remainder of the year, it is now clear that Ukraine will miss the end-December 2024 deadline for this benchmark. MPs seek to block international experts from governance appointments A group of 56 MPs, primarily representing factions such as the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party and the Opposition Platform for Life, has submitted a constitutional appeal challenging the involvement of international experts in selecting officials for key state bodies. If the Constitutional Court upholds this appeal, it could significantly disrupt Ukraine&#x2019;s reform efforts by barring international participation in appointing leaders to anti-corruption agencies (e.g., NABU and SAP), judicial institutions (e.g., the High Council of Justice), the Accounting Chamber, customs, and other oversight bodies. This move raises concerns about the potential rollback of reforms and jeopardizes Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments to international partners. Parliament extended tax and customs incentives The Verkhovna Rada adopted draft laws #12266 and #12267, extending several tax and customs exemptions for 2025. Key measures include customs duty exemptions for ammunition and drones production components, tax breaks for the import of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), night vision devices and anti-drone rifles, postponement of Euro-6 vehicle standards implementation until 2027, extending VAT exemptions for the Ukrainian film industry during martial law etc. Parliament meets one Ukraine Plan requirement The Verkhovna Rada has passed draft law #6227, amending the National Program for the Development of Ukraine&apos;s Mineral Resource Base through 2030. The draft law should come into force in 2024 to meet the deadline set in the Ukraine Plan under the Ukraine Facility mechanism of financial support from the EU. According to the Ukraine Plan, this step shall allow to define the terms of strategic and critical raw materials, the need for regular methodological risk assessment of the level of security of their supply, the definition of a group of partner countries, and update the priorities of the national geological program, as provided for by the EU Strategic Critical Raw Materials Strategy 2030.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-6/	2024-12-27T07:28:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
China’s Xi Jinping to visit Russia next year, Kremlin’s Beijing ambassador says	China&apos;s President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to Russia next year, the Kremlin&#x2019;s ambassador to Beijing said on Dec. 27. Speaking to Russian media, Ambassador Igor Morgulov said plans for several bilateral events were being &quot;drawn up&quot; but that Xi&#x2019;s trip was a priority. &quot;What can be said that is no secret, in terms of priority, is that the chairman of the People&apos;s Republic of China is expected in Russia next year,&quot; he said. China has strengthened its ties with Russia since the beginning of its full-scale war against Ukraine. However, Beijing has denied allegations of aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. Since February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and again in May 2024. Xi visited Russia in March 2023 where he was welcomed by his &#xA0;&quot;dear friend&quot; Putin. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine. Beijing has been trying to enlist developing nations to join its six-point peace plan, which China and Brazil laid out in May. The six-point plan calls for: It makes no mention of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-xi-jinping-to-visit-russia-next-year-kremlins-beijing-ambassador-says/	2024-12-27T07:20:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2179663881.jpg
Ukraine repelling Russian attempt to gain foothold in Kherson Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops have thwarted a Russian attempt to gain a foothold on one of its islands on the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on national TV on Dec. 27. &quot;Over the past day, (Russia) continued its attempts to land on Kozatsky Island, but was unsuccessful, suffered losses and was unable to land,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia had suffered &quot;losses in equipment, in particular, in boats, watercraft, and personnel.&quot; Voloshyn added that Russia suffered about 150 military losses as well as equipment, including two tanks, amid fighting in the region. Voloshyn&apos;s comments comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 that the region was &quot;observing an increase in enemy activity&quot; from sabotage groups, attempting to gain a foothold. On Dec. 26, Voloshyn said that the Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, and are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River in order to transfer firepower there. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repelling-russian-attempt-to-gain-foothold-in-kherson-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-27T06:39:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1844442017.jpg
Ukraine completes preparations for second peace summit, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine has completed necessary preparations for the second global peace summit, though work is ongoing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 27 briefing. Following the first peace summit in Switzerland in June 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the second meeting &quot;should lay the foundations of lasting and just peace.&quot; While Ukraine aimed to hold the summit before the end of 2024, Tykhyi said the focus is on achieving substantive outcomes rather than organizing &#x201C;an event for the sake of an event.&#x201D; Addressing the summit&#x2019;s timing, the spokesperson pointed to global political shifts, including changes in U.S. and European administrations, as factors influencing preparations. &#x201C;Ukraine is now in a strong diplomatic position, as everything is prepared. But, of course, we need to prepare for this summit to take place and be effective,&#x201D; he said. The peace formula, central to Ukraine&#x2019;s vision for ending the war, remains the foundation of Kyiv&#x2019;s approach, according to Tykhyi. Kyiv has indicated plans to invite a Russian representative to the second summit, signaling a potential shift toward engaging Moscow in discussions. Swiss President Viola Amherd previously said that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be permitted to attend despite the International Criminal Court&#x2019;s arrest warrant.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-continues-preparations-for-second-global-peace-summit-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-12-27T06:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Belarus Weekly — 2024 in review: Drone incursions, deepening alliance with Russia, totalitarianism	In 2024, Belarus, under dictator Alexander Lukashenko, continued to descend into totalitarianism, imprisoning people at will and providing full-fledged support to Russia in its brutal all-out war. Lukashenko signed a number of bilateral treaties with Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin, helping him facilitate the major East-West prisoner swap that saw spies and murderers return safely to Russia. Lukashenko also reignited a major migrant crisis at the country&apos;s western borders, effectively making it harder for people to leave the state. Here is the round-up of key events that happened in Belarus in 2024. 2024 ends with the Russian and Belarusian dictators, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, signing a security treaty after Russia amended its nuclear doctrine to include Belarus under its nuclear umbrella. The amended doctrine also lowers the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons by Russia. While the treaty&#x2019;s text was not released, Putin said it outlined mutual defense obligations, including nuclear capabilities, and experts suggest it may allow Russia to set up bases in Belarus and deepen Belarusian involvement in the war. Putin also said that the treaty provides for the protection of each other&#x2019;s constitutional order, a notable remark after Russian Ambassador to Belarus Boris Gryzlov promised Moscow would help Lukashenko quell any potential disorder during the 2025 presidential elections. Following the signing, Lukashenko requested Russia to station Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) in Belarus, just as he did with the nuclear weapons in 2023. Putin agreed but postponed any such move to the second half of 2025. The year saw another attempt of nuclear blackmail by Russia &#x2014; with Belarus in a supporting role. In May, the Belarusian Defense Ministry conducted snap inspections of tactical nuclear weapons launchers, which, while capable of carrying nuclear warheads, also double as conventional weapons, once again providing no confirmation that any Russian nuclear weapons are present in Belarus. The next major joint military drills on Belarusian soil are scheduled for September 2025. The NATO Summit declaration warned early in 2024 that the deepening Russia-Belarus military integration destabilizes the region. Tensions rose and fell throughout the summer on the Belarus-Ukraine border, as Minsk accused Ukraine of military buildups in late June, while Kyiv claimed Belarus concentrated forces near the border in August following Ukraine&#x2019;s operation to capture parts of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Lukashenko also provided Putin with a helping hand during POW exchanges this year. In June, he released five Ukrainians who had been jailed in Belarus on politically motivated charges in exchange for Metropolitan Jonathan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)In August, German citizen Rico Krieger, sentenced in Belarus to capital punishment for allegedly planning an act of terrorism, was released as a part of a swap that returned Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov from prison in Germany. No Belarus opposition figures were released as part of the exchange. At least 19 other foreign nationals remain behind bars in Belarus. They might be used in future prisoner swaps. Meanwhile, Belarus is growing more and more dependent on Russia economically. Relying on reduced oil prices, Russian loans and Russian markets for Belarusian exports, Lukashenko has had to deepen integration with Russia. Following Trump&#x2019;s electoral victory, the official Minsk actively seeked a seat at the negotiations table between Russia and Ukraine and security guarantees for itself. Political analysts said the moves are prompted by Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to restore his international legitimacy, but also by his wish for a counterbalance to his dependence on Russia. Open-source intelligence project Belarusian Hajun reported 356 Russian drone violations of Belarusian airspace between July and Dec. 18. The count keeps rising, undermining Lukashenko&#x2019;s earlier promise of a &#x201C;peaceful sky.&#x201D; From July, the incursions began to rise sharply, peaking in November with 38 stray drones recorded in Belarusian airspace in one night. One combat UAV crashed without causing casualties but leading to the arrest of a witness. The Belarusian military reportedly downed drones only twice. The drones, targeting Ukraine, cross from Russia and are reportedly diverted by Ukrainian electronic warfare. Minsk has largely ignored Russian incursions and never publicly objected. Lukashenko, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of provocations, claiming it was Kyiv that had sent drones into Belarus. As Russia and Belarus continued to send migrants across the border into the European Union, bordering states &#x2014; Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia &#x2014; announced the Baltic Defense Line in January. Meanwhile, Poland launched its 2.5-billion &#x201C;Shield East&#x201D; to bolster its borders with Belarus and Russia with anti-drone surveillance and fortifications on the ground. Lithuania is also investing $1.1 billion in a military base close to the Lithuania-Belarus border to house up to 4,000 combat-ready German troops &#x2014; the first deployment of German troops abroad since World War II. Russia-aligned Hungary remains the only EU state maintaining ties with Belarus. Its Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijarto visited Minsk in 2024, calling for sanctions to be lifted. Hungary also relaxed its migration legislation to allow Belarusians and Russians to work and live in the country, raising EU concerns. Meanwhile, the EU pledged 170 million euros to fortify the union&#x2019;s borders as Belarus and Russia escalated their &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; by channeling migrants with Russian visas into the union. Following the killing of a Polish soldier patrolling the border in May, Polish authorities reinstated a 200-meter-deep buffer zone along the country&#x2019;s border and pledged about $375 million to modernize its 190-kilometer border fence with Russia and Belarus, erected in 2021. Poland also sought Chinese intervention in the crisis, citing complications for international trade under the Chinese Belt and Road initiative &#x2014; an overland trade route to Europe involving Belarus. While these measures have temporarily slowed the pace of the crisis, they haven&#x2019;t resolved it: In 2024, Poland reported thwarting 30,000 illegal border crossing attempts. The cross-border crisis reportedly took 59 lives between January and October 2024. &#xA0; In the wake of the migrant crisis, the U.S. State Department designated Belarus as a state sponsor of human trafficking. The standoff between the eastern EU member states and Belarus is a setback for democratically leaning Belarusians abroad and within the country. Out of 14 border crossings between the EU and Belarus, only five remained in operation, after Lithuania shut down two more in March. Leaving Belarus now takes hundreds of dollars in visa fees and hours, sometimes days, to cross the border via one of the remaining checkpoints. Furthermore, Lithuania has tightened restrictions on Belarusian migrants, citing security concerns, leading to a decline in the number of Belarusian residents for the first time in four years. Latvia has banned Belarus-registered vehicles on its territory. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko spent much of 2024 preparing to extend his 30-year streak in power with a seventh consecutive term as president. In February, Belarus held tightly controlled parliamentary and local elections. The voting, condemned by the West and dismissed as a farce by the country&#x2019;s opposition, was viewed as a dress rehearsal for the presidential race, the first since the sham presidential vote in 2020 caused widespread public protests. &#xA0; Following rigged parliamentary elections, the All-Belarus People&#x2019;s Assembly convened for the first time in a new capacity as the extra-governmental body. Despite its grand name, the body is increasingly viewed as a &quot;decor&quot; for the Lukashenko regime &#x2014; presenting the illusion of distributed power, while Lukashenko remains in sole control as the country&apos;s dictator.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The latest presidential elections are scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, nearly half a year earlier than is stipulated in Belarusian election law. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) announced on Dec. 23 that the incumbent, the heads of three loyalist parties &#x2014; Aleh Haidukevich, Alexander Hizhnyak, Siarhei Syrankou &#x2014; as well as a spoiler candidate, representing so-called &#x201C;constructive opposition,&#x201D; Hanna Kanapatskaya, would be allowed to run. The campaign takes place in a sterilized political environment with raging repressions. All but four political parties have been liquidated, and those that remain are loyal to the regime. Independent media have been dissolved or forced into exile, and branded &#x201C;extremists.&#x201D; The only remaining point of discussion now, political analysts say, is what percentage the Election Committee will &#x201C;allocate&#x201D; to Lukashenko on Jan. 26, 2025. Having no winning strategy, between calling for boycotting the election and voting against all candidates, Belarus&#x2019;s exiled opposition has focused on campaigning internationally for the non-recognition of the sham election&#x2019;s results. As the election date nears, Belarusian law enforcers have intensified intimidation, arresting and harassing dissidents. Belarusian authorities have also partially blocked YouTube and VPN services during major opposition events throughout the year, and Lukashenko admitted he would not shy away from shutting down the Internet completely if unrest arises during the vote. In 2024, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko began to pardon political opponents, sparking speculation about his motives &#x2014; which ranged from seeking sanctions relief and restoring relations with the West, to election strategy. The gesture did not imply any political reconciliation, as over 220 jailed Belarusians received political prisoner status over the same time. As I write this roundup, 1,294 officially recognized political prisoners remain behind bars, with the actual number likely much higher due to the authorities&#x2019; obstruction to reporting by human rights groups. Three prisoners &#x2014; Ihar Lednik, Aliaksandr Kulinich, and Dmitry Shletgauer &#x2014; have died in custody, bringing the total number of deaths of political prisoners since 2020 to seven. Eight high-profile prisoners, including 2020 presidential candidates Viktar Babaryka and Siarhei Tsikhanouski, the long-time opposition politician Mikalai Statkevich, and RFE/RL journalist Ihar Losik, have been held incommunicado for over a year now. Solidarity efforts in support of the prisoners and their families have been criminalized. Throughout the year, police raids also targeted diaspora groups, exiled journalists&#x2019; homes, and political activists in and out of the country. 2024 was the darkest and most repressive year for the Belarusian media, with the number of jailed journalists jumped from 32 to 45. Journalists are facing in absentia trials and repeated convictions, the Viasna Human Rights Center notes. Reporters Without Borders placed Belarus 167th out of 180 in its annual Press Freedom ranking, and among the world&#x2019;s four biggest jailers of journalists in 2024. Foreign countries are no safe haven for the opponents of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. A former member of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, a volunteer unit fighting for Ukraine, was extradited to Belarus from Vietnam in December, facing charges that could lead to his execution. Meanwhile, Belarusian activist Andrei Hniot narrowly escaped extradition from Serbia at the request of the Belarusian office of Interpol. He was incarcerated for over a year. Detentions at Belarus&#x2019;s request also occurred in Armenia, but didn&#x2019;t lead to extraditions due to a political conflict between the two countries. Sweden announced it would reexamine asylum applications from Belarusians after a Belarus citizen was extradited to Belarus and reportedly imprisoned soon after. Over 3,000 Belarusian activists, politicians, and journalists were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted lists. Russia and Belarus also created joint lists of &#x201C;extremists,&#x201D; which are used to persecute opponents of the authorities. Opponents physically out of reach of Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime are subjected to in absentia trials. At least 112 Belarusian politicians and activists have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms and seizure of property without ever setting foot in a courtroom to defend themselves. Lithuania has asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s alleged crimes against humanity, including mass deportation and persecution. Following the 2020 election, a regime crackdown forced over 300,000 Belarusians out of the country of 9.5 million. The Lithuanian authorities believe this might constitute a crime of mass deportation and have requested that the ICC hold Lukashenko accountable. While the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has confirmed the referral by Lithuania, no other countries have joined the effort &#x2014; unlike in the ICC case against Russian President Vladimir Putin, against whom an arrest warrant was issued in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-2024-in-review-drone-incursions-deepening-alliance-with-russia-totalitarianism/	2024-12-27T05:28:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184329764.jpg
Loud bang heard before Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed, passengers tell Reuters	Two passengers who survived the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane in Kazakhstan heard a loud bang as it approached its original destination of Grozny, Reuters reported on Dec. 27. The plane, en route from Baku on Dec. 25, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. Initial reports suggest it could have been downed by a Russian surface-to-air missile. The head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR), Kyrylo Budanov, on Dec. 27 said the aircraft had been hit by &quot;a Russian Pantsir S1 air defense system on Russian terrain.&quot; Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially attributed the crash to a collision with a flock of birds, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Speaking to Reuters, passenger Subhonkul Rakhimov said he heard a loud bang as it approached Grozny, after which he &quot;thought the plane was going to fall apart.&quot; The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny, Chechnya on Dec. 25. The plane had attempted to land in Grozny, but Russian airports reportedly denied it permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan. According to Euronews sources, shrapnel from the explosion reportedly struck the passengers and cabin crew as the missile detonated mid-flight near the aircraft. Footage analyzed by independent media outlets Meduza and Mediazona shows damage consistent with surface-to-air missile impacts, including holes in the fuselage and traces of a missile strike on the tail section. The tail section of the Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) passenger plane that crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, pictured on December 27, 2024 (Meiramgul Kussainova/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian officials have said the pilots decided to reroute from their original destination Grozny amid dense fog and a local alert over Ukrainian drones, but said it&#x2019;s important to wait for the definitive results of the investigation before speculating about the cause. Rasim Musabekov, a member of Azerbaijan&apos;s parliament and foreign affairs committee member, told Azerbaijani news agency Turan that it was evident that the plane was &quot;shot down over Russian territory, in the sky above Grozny. It is impossible to deny this.&quot; &quot;Those responsible for this must be held criminally accountable, and compensation must be paid for the deaths and injuries. If this doesn&apos;t happen, the relations will certainly shift to a different level,&quot; Musabekov added.	https://kyivindependent.com/loud-bang-heard-before-azerbaijan-airlines-crashed-passengers-tell-reuters/	2024-12-27T05:15:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903922.jpg
45% of Ukrainians think Trump’s election will bring peace closer, survey finds	Nearly half of Ukrainians believe that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in the presidential election could bring peace closer in the ongoing war, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on Dec. 27. The survey, conducted from Dec. 2 to 17 with 985 telephone respondents, reveals a blend of optimism and skepticism regarding Trump&#x2019;s potential influence on the war. Among those who see peace as closer under Trump, 15% believe it is significantly closer, while 30% feel it is only somewhat closer. Trump&#x2019;s previous criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine and his intent to &#x201C;get out&#x201D; of the war has sparked concerns that his approach may involve pressuring Kyiv into concessions to achieve a settlement. Among those who see peace as closer under Trump, 15% believe it is significantly closer, while 30% feel it is only somewhat closer. Overall, 23% of respondents think peace under Trump would be mostly or completely fair to Ukraine, whereas 31% believe it would be mostly or completely unfair. Another 29% anticipate a balance of Ukrainian demands being met alongside concessions to Russia, with no clear advantage for either side. The remaining 18% were undecided.	https://kyivindependent.com/45-of-ukrainians-see-trumps-election-bringing-peace-closer-poll-finds/	2024-12-27T05:14:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Russia ramps up production of Shahed drones, decoys at Tatarstan plant, CNN reports	Russia has significantly increased the production of Shahed-136 drones and cheaper decoy drones at the Yelabuga drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, CNN reported on Dec. 27. This facility, located over 1,300 kilometers from the Ukraine border, plays a critical role in Moscow&#x2019;s drone manufacturing strategy. In 2023, the factory produced 2,738 Shahed-136-type drones, given the name Geran in Russia, with output more than doubling to 5,760 units in the first nine months of 2024. The facility also began serial production of &quot;Gerbera&quot; decoy drones, which mimic the radar signature of real Shaheds but are made from plywood and foam plastic. Russia plans to produce 10,000 Gerberas by the end of 2024, twice the number of Geran drones. Each Gerbera reportedly costs 10 times less to produce than a Geran. The production surge is facilitated by imports of components from China and the recruitment of low-skilled labor, including local teenagers and workers from Africa. The Alabuga Start project actively recruits African workers for the program, according to the report. Despite official statements of neutrality, China allegedly supplies drone components and technology through a network of 34 companies. Satellite imagery from March to September 2023 reportedly revealed a 55% increase in production space at the Alabuga site, along with enhanced facility security, including anti-drone cages and a fortified perimeter. The Yelabuga plant, launched in July 2023, manufactures a range of drones, including Shahed-type drones and reconnaissance models like the Albatross. Russia regularly employs drones and missiles to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The plant has faced disruptions, including from Ukrainian attacks. On Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported a fire at a Shahed warehouse in Alabuga, destroying $16 million worth of drone parts. In April, in an effort to counter Russia&apos;s expanding drone production, Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Yelabuga facility.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ramps-up-production-of-shahed-drones-decoys-at-tatarstan-plant-cnn-reports/	2024-12-27T04:57:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2172645649.jpg
Ukraine working to extend basic training to 2 months, Syrskyi says	Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership plans to extend basic military training to two months to enhance the preparedness and safety of soldiers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Dec. 27. The initiative follows consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and leaders of individual combat units. &#x201C;We are currently working to create conditions for the training to last 2 months in total. High-quality training means, first and foremost, the preservation of the lives and health of our soldiers,&#x201D; Syrskyi said. He noted that recent graduates had completed a revised 1.5-month training course, an improvement from the previous 30-day standard. While an additional 5-14 days of training within military units is planned, intense battlefield conditions have sometimes limited this step. Syrskyi emphasized the importance of addressing training challenges and updating basic military training standards to meet current needs. These efforts complement broader reforms under General Mykhailo Drapatyi, appointed commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces on Dec. 12. Drapatyi&#x2019;s vision includes transforming the Ground Forces into an &#x201C;elite&#x201D; military unit by modernizing training programs, integrating advanced technology, and prioritizing social support for service members. In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. The planned changes aim to improve the effectiveness of Ukrainian forces as they continue to face intense hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-extend-basic-military-training-to-2-months-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-27T03:29:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Trump's China strategy hinges on crippling Russia’s economy	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is determined to confront China economically and strategically. This is a difficult problem, because so many goods purchased in the United States have supply chains with deep roots in the Chinese manufacturing base. If new U.S. tariffs cause the Chinese renminbi to depreciate, as seems likely, Chinese products will remain competitive, at least in the short run; and if the cost of Chinese imported goods in the U.S. actually rises, this will squeeze lower-income Americans and undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturers that currently use imported components. The proposed tariffs and associated bluster may induce global companies to shift manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Mexico, and other lower-wage countries, but will not bring many good jobs back to the U.S. But Trump could score a quick and impressive win against China: by turning Russia entirely out of Ukraine and restoring the pre-invasion borders. Such a dramatic diplomatic coup would boost U.S. prestige around the world and strengthen Trump&#x2019;s hand in dealing with China on other issues. It would also be straightforward: Russia is heavily dependent on oil exports, and Trump can cut Russian net revenue from these exports to essentially zero from his first day. Without this revenue, the Russian war machine will grind to a halt. Russia has a relatively small economy. Its GDP in 2024 will be around $2.2 trillion, which is less than 8% of the U.S. economy. Russia punches above its economic weight, literally and metaphorically, by allying itself with Iran (for drones and other military equipment), with North Korea (for artillery shells and soldiers), and with China (for essential components and consumer goods). In this Alliance of Aggression, China has by far the largest economy, and Russia has effectively become a client state. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought tacit approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping before invading Ukraine in 2022. According to credible sources, Xi asked Putin to wait until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and Putin did as he was told. He was wise to be deferential: in 2023, China supplied more than 50% of all Russian battlefield-related imports (including critical components for the Russian army) with a total value of some $5.5 billion. Without the ongoing availability of Chinese components, Russia&#x2019;s stock of missiles would be quickly depleted, and air superiority should shift decisively in favor of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) takes part in a welcoming ceremony with Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) in Beijing, China, on Nov. 9, 2017. (Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images)China does not provide these goods to Russia (or anyone) for free. Nor is it interested in Russian debt &#x2014; China&#x2019;s leaders do not trust Putin&#x2019;s ability and willingness to repay. This means that running the Russian war machine on Chinese components requires cash on delivery (or even advance payments). Russia generates that cash by selling oil for U.S. dollars. Almost all other Russian exports are quite small, owing to sanctions. But the G7 and the European Union agreed to keep Russian oil on the world market, largely because Russia is such a large supplier &#x2014; about eight million barrels per day (daily global consumption is about 100 million barrels). On his first day in office, Trump can announce that he will impose heavy U.S. sanctions on any company that pays more than $15 per barrel for Russian oil (and on anyone who participates in any transaction above that level). Any country that is deemed not to be fully cooperative with this policy should expect to face punitive tariffs. As Trump knows well, threats are sometimes most potent when no action is taken. During his first administration, he wanted Mexico to close its southern border with Guatemala, so he announced that he would raise tariffs every week until action was taken. The Mexican government saw this as a crazy threat, but one that was entirely credible, and they deployed their security forces to close the border. The additional tariffs stayed on the shelf. U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration worked long and hard to negotiate a G7-EU price cap on Russian crude, which currently stands at $60 per barrel. But while this initiative was a welcome example of cooperation among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies, at this price Russia still earns substantial revenue, because its marginal costs of extraction are low ($15-20 per barrel). Trump&#x2019;s preference for unilateral action backed by bombast and vague threats would fit the moment well. To the extent that more oil moves from Russia to China, the &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; of tankers that transport it should be harassed at every opportunity, pushing up operating costs and further squeezing Russian margins. Impound a few shadow tankers for suspected sanctions violations and watch the price of transportation for Russian oil soar. Even at $15 per barrel, Russia will likely continue to pump as much oil as it can, because Putin is so desperate for cash. But what if Trump&#x2019;s threats and actions push up the world oil price? This would please Trump&#x2019;s allies in the fossil-fuel industry immensely, while also encouraging and justifying more oil and gas exploration. (Yes, this is bad for the climate, but we are discussing Trump&#x2019;s realpolitik here, including what will get Congress fully on board with his &#x201C;Drill, Baby, Drill&#x201D; agenda.) A much lower oil-price cap, backed up with stronger sanctions against companies and countries that trade illegally with Russia, would leave Putin with no choice but to withdraw from Ukraine. That, in turn, would send a powerful signal to the Alliance of Aggression, and to the Chinese leadership in particular: Anyone who attacks a neighbor will suffer crippling economic consequences.

Ukraine sends 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria under humanitarian program, Zelensky says	Ukraine has sent 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria as part of its &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; initiative, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 27. The aid aims to help alleviate a looming food crisis following the collapse of the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8 amid a large-scale rebel offensive. &quot;500 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat flour are already on their way to Syria as part of our &apos;Grain from Ukraine&apos; humanitarian program in cooperation with the WFP (World Food Programme),&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. The shipment is expected to feed 33,250 families, approximately 167,000 people, over the coming weeks. Each bag of flour can sustain a family of five for a month. &quot;We wish Syria and its people safety, stability, and recovery. We know the true value of these things,&quot; Zelensky said. Launched in fall 2022, the Grain from Ukraine program has reportedly saved 20 million people from hunger, according to Zelensky. As one of the world&#x2019;s leading agricultural producers, Ukraine has continued to provide vital food supplies to countries in Africa and Asia despite the challenges of Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sends-500-tons-of-wheat-flour-to-syria-under-humanitarian-program-zelensky-says/	2024-12-27T02:49:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/grain.jpg
3 senior Russian officers killed in HIMARS, drone attack, Ukraine’s military intelligence says	Three senior Russian officers have been killed in a Ukrainian strike using HIMARS and drones in an occupied area of Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 27. HUR said it obtained intelligence on a planned meeting of the Russian personnel, and along with the Unmanned Systems Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), formulated a plan of attack. Video released by HUR shows drone footage of several vehicles parked near a road. A large explosion is then followed by what appears to be the detonation of a cluster munition. 0:00/1&#xD7;The post accompanying the video says High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) were used in the initial attack, with strike drones later targeting an evacuation group. It did not state when the attack took place. According to HUR, the three Russian officers killed in the strike were Captain Nagorny Dmitry Olegovich, commander of the 1st battalion of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, Captain Krokhmalov Grigory Aleksandrovich, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, and Captain Fomin Yuri Viktorovich, commander of the anti-aircraft battery of the 4th Guards Military Base. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022. Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously. In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS &#x2013; fired from HIMARS launchers &#x2013; with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within. The weapons system is a multiple rocket launcher system mounted to a 6x6 FMTV truck chassis, providing devastating firepower launched from a highly mobile platform. Its rockets are radar-guided, with a range of around 70 kilometers (over 40 miles). When combined with high mobility, it is the ideal &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; system to target enemy weapons dumps and command posts. HIMARS success stories are too numerous to count, but in February they were used against a military training ground in occupied areas of Donetsk Oblast where Russian troops were stationed, killing at least 60, the BBC reported. A U.S. $725 million weapons package for Ukraine announced on Dec. 2 contained fresh supplies of HIMARS ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-senior-russian-officers-killed-in-himars-drone-attack-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-12-27T02:12:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-27-09_32_20.jpg
Russia's new Oreshnik missile relies on Western manufacturing technology, FT reports	Russia&#x2019;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, recently fired at Ukraine, was developed using advanced manufacturing equipment from Western companies, despite sanctions, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 27. The missile, launched at Dnipro on Nov. 21, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. Two key Russian weapons engineering institutes &#x2014; Moscow Institute for Thermal Technology (MITT) and Sozvezdie &#x2014; were named by Ukrainian intelligence as developers of the Oreshnik. According to the Financial Times, they posted job listings in 2024 that specified expertise in operating German and Japanese metalworking systems. The listings cited Fanuc (Japan), Siemens, and Haidenhein (both Germany) control systems for high-precision computer numerical control machines essential for missile production. Despite sanctions slowing the flow of such equipment, FT analysis found that at least $3 million worth of Heidenhain components were shipped into Russia in 2024, with some buyers closely tied to military production. Defense expert Fabian Hoffmann from the University of Oslo suggested the Oreshnik is not a wholly new development but rather a modification of the RS-26 Rubezh missile. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. The reliance on Western machinery points to continued vulnerabilities in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry amid ongoing sanctions aimed at curtailing its military capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-new-oreshnik-missile-relies-on-western-manufacturing-technology-ft-reports/	2024-12-27T01:42:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Storm damages Russian anti-drone barriers near Crimean Bridge, satellite images reveal	A storm in the Kerch Strait damaged barriers protecting the illegal Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian maritime drones, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Dec. 26 with reference to recent satellite images. The barriers form part of a network of measures, both on land and sea, set up by Moscow to protect the bridge after multiple successful Ukrainian attacks. The images, taken on Nov. 8, Dec. 16, and Dec. 24, reveal that Russia has yet to fully repair the barriers, which are constructed from old barges. The storm also sank two Russian tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, in mid-December, according to Russian outlets Mash and Baza. The number of deployed barriers in the Kerch Strait has halved over the past month, according to a Dec. 10 report by the Center of Journalistic Investigations. In September, another storm washed ashore protective barriers made of plastic and metal barrels, underscoring their vulnerability to severe weather. These incidents have further reduced Russia&apos;s ability to defend the 19-kilometer-long bridge, an important supply route for Russian forces. Constructed after Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the bridge has been a repeated target of Ukrainian strikes, suffering significant damage in October 2022 and July 2023. It remains a focal point of the conflict and a subject of legal proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration between Ukraine and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/storm-damages-russian-anti-drone-barriers-near-crimean-bridge-satellite-images-reveal/	2024-12-27T01:11:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243954958.jpg
Ukraine considers 60,000 citizens as missing persons, official says	As of late 2024, 60,000 individuals in Ukraine are considered missing under special circumstances, Ukrinform reported on Dec. 26, citing Dmytro Bohatyuk, head of the Interior Ministry&#x2019;s Department for Missing Persons. These cases stem from war, occupation, and natural or man-made disasters. The figures underscore the extensive humanitarian toll of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, marked by illegal deportations, kidnappings, and significant military and civilian casualties. Since the launch of the Unified Register of Persons Missing in Special Circumstances, over 70,000 cases have been documented. &#x201C;As of today, about 60,000 are still actively searched for,&#x201D; Bohatyuk said, noting that the remaining cases involve individuals who were either found alive or identified among the deceased. The missing person count does not include over 19,500 Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories. Efforts to locate missing individuals continue amid the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-60-000-citizens-as-missing-persons-ukrainian-official-says/	2024-12-27T00:42:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2153366565.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 6, injure 6 over past day	Russian forces launched multiple attacks across Ukraine, killing six civilians and injuring six, regional authorities reported on Dec. 27. Overnight, Russia launched 24 drones from inside Russia, as well as two Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Voronezh and Kursk oblasts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian defenses shot down 13 drones across Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, and Donetsk oblasts. Eleven other drones were reportedly brought down with electronic warfare countermeasures. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian troops attacked an apartment block in Chasiv Yar with an FPV (first person view) drone, killing two civilians and injuring two others. Another civilian was killed in Novoekonomichne near Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces shelled border areas and settlements 169 times, causing 311 explosions. One civilian was killed, and a private house was destroyed by the attacks, according to the local administration. Kharkiv Oblast also came under fire, with the Russian military launching a KAB guided bomb attack, killing two people and injuring four, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-6-injure-6-over-past-day/	2024-12-26T23:49:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
Seoul confirms Ukrainian capture of wounded North Korean soldier in Kursk Oblast	South Korean intelligence confirmed that Ukrainian forces captured a wounded North Korean soldier during operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Yonhap reported on Dec. 27, citing the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS). The confirmation followed a report on the capture from Ukraine&apos;s military-focused news outlet Militarnyi on Dec. 26, though it did not specify the date of the incident. &#x201C;Through real-time information sharing with a friendly nation&apos;s intelligence organization, (we) confirmed the capture of a wounded North Korean soldier and plan to thoroughly examine the subsequent development,&#x201D; the NIS said. A photo of the soldier, reportedly injured, has circulated on Telegram, though details about his condition and status remain unclear. North Korean troops deployed in Kursk Oblast continue to face significant losses. Approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been stationed there since August to bolster Russian forces. Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka on Dec. 20 inflicted heavy casualties, including the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, according to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR). Despite mounting casualties, Russian officers have ordered North Korean units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical challenges for these troops, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reportedly-captures-wounded-north-korean-soldier-in-kursk-oblast-seoul-confirms/	2024-12-26T23:15:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-26_21-16-58.jpg

Moldova approves 10-year defense strategy amid tensions with Russia	Moldova&#x2019;s parliament, dominated by pro-Western lawmakers, approved a 10-year defense strategy on Dec. 26 aimed at boosting defense spending as part of its efforts to join the European Union. Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatii presented the strategy, which seeks to raise spending to 1% of the country&#x2019;s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. &quot;The first step to implementing this was taken after the war in Ukraine started, by increasing budget resources for defense to 0.39% in 2022 and 0.55% in 2023,&quot; the document said, according to Reuters. The pro-Russian opposition in parliament mocked the strategy, calling it an unnecessary move against Moscow given Moldova&#x2019;s small size and limited military capacity. Adrian Albu, a member of the pro-Moscow Socialist Party, dismissed the strategy as futile. &quot;If, God forbid, we are subject to an attack from the direction of the Russian Federation, how long do you think Moldova will resist such aggression? Simply because we are shouting from a rostrum?&quot; he reportedly said. Moldova, one of Europe&#x2019;s poorest countries, lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status, which the constitution enshrines. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 heightened Moldova&#x2019;s security concerns, with drone fragments landing on its territory and missiles targeting Ukraine passing through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, re-elected last month, albeit with a narrower margin than expected, accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government. The new defense strategy also addresses the risks of the Ukraine war spreading, particularly near the Black Sea port of Odesa, which is close to Moldova&#x2019;s border.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-approves-10-year-defense-strategy-amid-tensions-with-russia/	2024-12-26T17:22:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1686329479.jpg
Ukrainian platoon commander charged with abuse of authority, accused of beating, humiliating subordinates	Ukrainian law enforcement agents have charged a platoon commander of Ukraine&apos;s 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade with abuse of authority, accusing the individual of beating and humiliating subordinates, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Dec. 26. Although authorities did not name the accused, Ukrainian media reported that the individual in question was Vladyslav Pastukh. According to officials, the accused allegedly beat at least three soldier while serving along the front line between February and May 2024. In one instance, after finding another soldier intoxicated, the accused kicked the soldier in the face as well as other parts of his body. In a separate instance, the commander ordered subordinates to tie the victim to a wooden cross, where the soldier was immobilized for four hours. In another incident, the commander &quot;beat another soldier over a dispute over the publication of a video recording on the internet about inadequate living conditions,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office alleged. While a separate alleged assault occurred when a subordinate addressed the commander &quot;inappropriately.&quot; The accused has been charged with &quot;abuse of authority by a military official&quot; under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code, Hromadske reported, as well as two other charges related to desertion. The commander faces up to 12 years in prison, if convicted. Pastukh was previously named in an investigation by Ukrainska Pravda that reported officers of 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade had beaten service members, extorted money from them, and tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. Pastukh&apos;s godfather and commander of the brigade, Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, was taken into custody and charged with abuse of power on Dec. 19 for allegedly making four of his subordinates help him build his house in Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the fall of 2023. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-platoon-commander-charged-with-abuse-of-authority-accused-of-beating-humiliating-subordinates/	2024-12-26T15:50:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/m76m3s---c16x9x50px50p--602bda4951e6be4174d6758bef644d4f.webp
Trump administration should make first move to 'restore dialogue,' Lavrov says	Russia is willing to improve relations with the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, if the United States makes the &quot;first move&quot; in restarting dialogue, Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 26. &quot;If the signals that are coming from the new team in Washington to restore the dialogue that Washington interrupted after the start of a special military operation (Russia&#x2019;s term for its war against Ukraine), are serious, of course, we will respond to them,&quot; Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. &quot;But the Americans broke (off) the dialogue, so they should make the first move,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov&apos;s comments come ahead of Trump&apos;s January inauguration, who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Lavrov&apos;s comments come alongside those of Russian President Vladimir Putin who, on Dec. 26, provided contradictory statements on bringing the war to an end in 2025, saying that Russia aims &quot;to end the conflict,&quot; while also stating his hopes that Russia will &quot;achieve success on the front line.&quot; Following Putin&apos;s comments, Lavrov lambasted the possibility of a ceasefire, adding that &quot;a truce is a path to nowhere.&quot; &quot;We need final legal agreements that will fix all the conditions for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and, of course, the legitimate security interests of our neighbours,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov has regularly used distorted historical facts about NATO expansionism as the Kremlin&apos;s justification for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Putin previously expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at any time to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. However, he reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s unwavering demands for a peace agreement, including the rejection of any territorial concessions and a firm stance against Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-should-make-first-move-to-restore-dialogue-lavrov-says/	2024-12-26T14:28:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187729022.jpg
Russia 'not opposed' to having Slovakia host peace talks, Putin says	During a news conference following a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was open to having Slovakia host potential peace talks following the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Responding to questions from journalists, Putin said that Slovakian officials &quot;would be happy to provide their own country as a platform for negotiations. We are not opposed, if it comes to that. Why not? Since Slovakia takes such a neutral position.&quot; Putin&apos;s comments come after Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Putin at the Kremlin during a visit on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. The visit by the Russian-friendly leader was heavily criticized by EU and Ukrainian officials, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling Fico&apos;s pro-Russian energy policy a &quot;big security issue&quot; for Slovakia and Europe. &quot;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&quot; Zelensky asked in his criticism of Fico. Under Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. Putin&apos;s comments surrounding possible peace negotiations come ahead of the January inauguration of Donald Trump, who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. During his press conference, Putin provided contradictory statements on bringing the war to an end in 2025, saying that Russia aims &quot;to end the conflict,&quot; while also stating his hopes that Russia will &quot;achieve success on the front line.&quot; Trump suggested on Dec. 22 that Putin wants to hold a meeting with him &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. The plan would also cut off military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to enter negotiations. The Financial Times reported on Dec. 20 that despite these proposals, Trump intends to continue sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine when he becomes president.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-could-host-peace-ukraine-russia-talks-putin-says/	2024-12-26T13:19:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/fico.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits ballistic missile propellant plant in Rostov Oblast; North Korean troops endure heavy losses	Key developments on Dec. 26: The Ukrainian Air Force struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky, Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported on Dec. 26. These missiles are reportedly used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, including hospitals, residential buildings, and power plants. &quot;This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,&quot; Stratcom said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. On Dec. 24, drones struck the military airbase in Millerovo, according to local acting governor Yury Slyusar. Earlier, on Dec. 19, Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the SBU carried out a combined strike on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast. These operations are part of Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supply chain and hinder its ability to conduct attacks on Ukrainian cities. North Korean troops deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast continue to suffer significant losses, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 26. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka reportedly inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean troops. HUR confirmed the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, with additional losses recorded at multiple sites. Despite sanitary losses, including five soldiers on Dec. 20 alone, Russian officers ordered the units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical issues for North Korean units on the front lines, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities. However, Russian forces have continued supplying these troops with ammunition and food to sustain their positions and resume assault operations. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their inexperience with the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. While North Korean forces have proven vulnerable to Ukrainian drone strikes, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited gains in the region, recapturing some territory previously held by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian troops hit a Russian command post in the town of Lgov in Kursk Oblast, allegedly killing 18 Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported on Dec. 26. Ukrainian forces reportedly hit the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade, located in an abandoned civilian building in Lgov, overnight on Dec. 25. Following the attack, Kursk Oblast Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein claimed that Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. The strike killed 18 personnel and partially destroyed the command post, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications claimed in a Dec. 26 statement. A deputy brigade commander was most likely among the killed, and most of the killed soldiers were staff officers. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Kyiv&apos;s foothold in the Kursk region is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Russia&apos;s sabotage groups are trying to gain a foothold and have increased the number of attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 on national television. Prokudin&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. &quot;We are observing an increase in enemy activity. We understand the places where enemy airborne groups can land, and the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces are ready to destroy them,&quot; Prokudin said. Attacks are &quot;not rare,&quot; and Russian soldiers are trying to gain a foothold on the western bank of the Dnipro regularly, according to the governor. However, none of these attempts have been successful, he added. Russian diversionary groups are trying to gain a foothold on the islands near Kherson or on the western bank of the river every day, Prokudin said, adding that &quot;all the diversionists were eliminated.&quot; The Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Public willingness to support Ukraine &quot;until it wins&quot; has dropped significantly across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., according to a YouGov poll reported by The Guardian on Dec. 26. The survey, conducted between Dec. 3-18, highlights growing skepticism about prolonged support for Kyiv as the war with Russia drags on. In Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., support for Ukraine&apos;s victory remains relatively high at 50%, 40%, and 36%, respectively. However, these figures represent notable declines from January levels of 57%, 51%, and 50%. Meanwhile, the share of respondents favoring a negotiated peace has risen &#x2014; reaching 55% in Italy, 46% in Spain, 45% in Germany, and 43% in France &#x2014; up by eight-10 points in each country over the year. While many respondents across Western Europe oppose a settlement requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, there is widespread concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may reduce or withdraw American support for Ukraine after his inauguration on Jan. 20. Notably, in France, Germany, and Sweden, the percentage of people hoping for Ukraine&#x2019;s outright victory has remained stable since early 2023, though overall willingness to continue support until victory has declined elsewhere. In Poland, a CBOS poll on Dec. 17 showed a dramatic shift in public opinion, with 55% of respondents favoring an end to the conflict even if it means Ukraine ceding territory &#x2014; a sharp rise from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Support for Ukraine fighting without concessions has dropped to 31%, compared to 46% in September and 59% in April 2022. The contrasting attitudes underscore Ukraine&apos;s challenges as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. These changes in public sentiment could complicate Kyiv&apos;s efforts to sustain international backing in its defense against Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-ballistic-missile-propellant-plant-in-rostov-oblast-north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast-endure-heavy-losses/	2024-12-26T11:48:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Iranian President Pezeshkian plans to visit Moscow in January	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is going to visit Moscow on Jan. 17, the Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported on Dec. 26, citing Kazem Jalali, the Iranian Ambassador to Russia. Ties between Moscow and Tehran have deepened since the outbreak of the full-scale war in Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukraine as well as close-range ballistic missiles. Pezeshkian will hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 17, Jalali said. During the visit, the two leaders are expected to sign an agreement on cooperation between Tehran and Moscow. The new bilateral agreement is intended to replace the 20-year strategic one signed between the two countries in 2001 and extended in 2020. Putin and Pezeshkian first met on Oct. 11 in Turkmenistan. The meeting occurred during an international forum to which the leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan were invited, among others. Following another meeting between Putin and Pezeshkian in Kazan in late October, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the new agreements must &quot;formalize the parties&apos; commitment to close defense cooperation and interaction in the interests of regional and global peace and security.&quot; Pezeshkian won Iran&apos;s runoff election in July earlier this year, defeating hard-liner Saeed Jalili. Internationally recognized monitors were not present to verify the results or guarantee the election&apos;s fairness. The runoff election was triggered by the death of former President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister in a helicopter crash in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/iranian-president-pezeshkian-plans-to-visit-moscow-on-jan-17/	2024-12-26T11:13:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172434112.jpg
Russia detains 4 suspects allegedly planning to assassinate top defense officials	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained four Russians who allegedly were preparing a series of terrorist attacks against high-ranking Defense Ministry officials and their families, the agency&apos;s press service said on Dec. 26. The statement comes after the high-profile assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov in Moscow on Dec. 17. Kirillov, 54, served as the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense unit. He was killed with a bomb attached to a scooter. According to the FSB, four Russian detainees were involved in an alleged Ukrainian plot to assassinate senior military officers. They now face life imprisonment. One of the suspects is a Russian citizen who allegedly has been living in Ukraine since 2020. In November 2024, he arrived in Moscow via Moldova and Georgia as a deportee. He is suspected to have placed an explosive device disguised as a power bank under the service car of a senior official in the Russian Defense Ministry. The driver of the official was an alleged close relative of the detainee. Another high-ranking Russian military officer was the target of a plot involving a bomb hidden in a folder with documents. The documents were to be delivered by two Russians on the instructions of Ukrainian special services, the statement read. The FSB also detained a resident of Moscow suspected of surveilling the home and workplace of high-ranking Russian Defense Ministry officials and their family members. The suspect allegedly sent photos and videos to his handlers in Ukrainian special services. Improvised explosive devices and communication equipment were seized from the four detainees, the FSB claimed. The suspects have been charged with illegal trafficking in explosives, preparation for a terrorist attack, and high treason. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine usually does not comment on such arrests by the Russian FSB. Russian law enforcement agencies on Dec. 18 arrested a suspect in the Kirillov assassination, a citizen of Uzbekistan, who claimed to have been recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) previously claimed responsibility for the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/fsb-detains-four-russians-allegedly-preparing-assassination-attempts-on-russian-officials/	2024-12-26T10:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia declares state of emergency due to oil spill in Kerch Strait	Russia has declared a federal state of emergency in response to an ongoing oil spill in the Kerch Strait, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Aleksandr Kurenkov announced on Dec. 26. The crisis began when two Russian oil tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, suffered severe damage during a storm on Dec. 15. Both vessels were reportedly carrying about 4,000 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. &quot;I propose to classify the emergency situation caused by the tanker wreck in the Kerch Strait as an emergency situation of a federal nature and establish a federal level of response,&quot; Kurenkov said on Dec. 26. Russian state funds will now be directed to the emergency response and cleanup effort. Some 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil have spilled into the Kerch Strait, according to the Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti. Russian scientist Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said in a press conference on Dec. 25 that about 200,000 tons of soil along the Black Sea coast have been contaminated. The Kerch Strait separates mainland Russia from Russian-occupied Crimea. Greenpeace Ukraine warned on Dec. 16 that the destruction of the Russian oil tankers could cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage. &quot;Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,&quot; the head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Dr. Paul Johnston, said in a statement. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-declares-state-of-emergency-due-to-oil-spill-in-kerch-strait/	2024-12-26T10:14:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1556050975.jpg
Lukashenko seeks to deploy 10 Russian Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko plans to deploy 10 Russian Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev reported on his Telegram channel Yunashev Live on Dec. 26. The &quot;Oreshnik&quot; is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that Russia touts as an experimental weapon capable of bypassing advanced air defense systems. &#xA0; Answering Yunashev&apos;s question during the Eurasian Economic Union summit, Lukashenko said he expects 10 missile systems from Russia. &quot;If the Russians want to deploy more, we will deploy more,&quot; he added. Lukashenko previously asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to deploy Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus during the signing ceremony of new agreements between Russia and Belarus in early December. Putin responded that such a deployment was &quot;possible&quot; and said the missiles could be supplied to Belarus by the second half of 2025. The Oreshnik is likely not a new Russian development at all, Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. The weapon appears to be a modification of the RS-26 missile, also known as the Rubezh. &quot;I think basically they (Russians) just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades and a new paint job,&quot; Hoffman said. First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile with a known range of 5,800 kilometers. While Putin has claimed that Russia is planning mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Moscow likely possesses &quot;only a handful&quot; of these experimental missiles. Russia launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine following Kyiv&apos;s first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia. Moscow later acknowledged additional ATACMS strikes on targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-seeks-to-deploy-10-russian-oreshnik-missile-systems-in-belarus/	2024-12-26T09:38:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179663468.jpg
Historian Marci Shore: Putin’s obsession with denazification is ‘Freudian projection’	The return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to political life has raised uncomfortable questions about the future, not only within the U.S. but also on the global stage. This is particularly true for countries like Ukraine, which relies on U.S. aid as it&#x2019;s locked in a battle for survival against Russia&apos;s campaign of total annihilation. Trump&apos;s history of fostering a rapport with Russian leader Vladimir Putin only adds a layer of uncertainty to an already volatile geopolitical landscape. Amid this backdrop, many wonder how we arrived at this point. Intellectuals&#x2019; role has never been more essential &#x2014; or more fraught &#x2014; in exposing how history is manipulated to incite war and how, in such a climate, the ghosts of past tragedies risk being ignored. The persistent banality of evil and the ceaseless tide of daily tragedies challenge our ability to make sense of the modern world. The Kyiv Independent spoke with U.S. historian Marci Shore about a number of topics related to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, including national trauma, guilt, dehumanization, and totalitarianism. Historian Marci Shore on March 18, 2019. (Jind&#x159;ich Nosek (NoJin) / Wikimedia)This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: There seems to be an unprecedented disconnect between words and their meanings these days. Donald Trump was labeled a fascist by numerous respected officials, yet for his supporters, it was more of a gleeful provocation. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin distorts history by framing his genocidal war in Ukraine as &quot;denazification,&quot; desecrating the Soviet army&#x2019;s legacy &#x2014; a victory shaped in part by Ukrainians. This erosion of meaning reflects a broader crisis: when language becomes unmoored from truth, it is weaponized to manipulate rather than illuminate. What is sustaining this dissonance? Marci Shore: Let&#x2019;s disentangle a few different issues. One is about how we use concepts, analogies, and categories like &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; or &#x201C;concentration camps.&#x201D; These are essentially hermeneutic devices that help us mediate between the singular and the universal. No two historical situations are ever exactly alike, just like no two human beings are ever exactly alike. But these concepts &#x2014; like Kantian concepts &#x2014; help us to process and interpret disparate data. When I used the term &#x201C;fascist&#x201D; to describe Trump in 2016, most Americans found it overly hysterical. In the intervening eight years a lot us &#x2014; historians, philosophers, social scientists &#x2014; put in a lot of work to try to introduce this concept and its history into American consciousness. What has been heartbreaking is to see that, on the one hand, this effort was successful: the fascist elements of Trump&#x2019;s persona and movement are now much better understood as such. On the other hand, it seems that an overwhelmingly large number of American voters do not consider fascism a bad thing at all. Unfortunately, &#x201C;gleeful provocation&#x201D; is in fact a good description. So needless to say, &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure how much we&#x2019;ve accomplished. With respect to &#x201C;denazification,&#x201D; there are at least two big conceptual things going on. One is Freudian projection, which is sometimes called &#x201C;accusation in a mirror:&#x201D; the perpetrators&#x2019; projection of their own qualities onto the victims. That&#x2019;s fairly straightforward, so to speak. The phenomenon of post-truth, the unhinging of any even presumed connection between language claims and empirical reality, is much more complicated. This is why I tend to describe Putin&#x2019;s regime as &#x201C;neo-totalitarian,&#x201D; because I do think there&#x2019;s an important conceptual distinction between the absolutist truth claims made by the 20th-century totalitarian ideologies and the postmodern break from even any pretense of being constrained by empirical reality that we&#x2019;re seeing in Trumpism and Putinism.

(Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: At the same time, it&#x2019;s striking how some words appear to unnerve people &#x2014; namely, the Russian opposition&#x2019;s hesitancy around the word &#x201C;guilt.&#x201D; For example, Ilya Yashin, on one of his live streams, talked about how he&apos;s not a prosecutor and therefore has &#x201C;no right&#x201D; to tell people that they are guilty of Russia&#x2019;s war (or Putin&#x2019;s war, as he calls it). Do you think we&#x2019;ll ever see Russian society have serious &#x2014; and necessary &#x2014; discussions about the varying degrees of collective accountability, as the Germans did after World War II? Marci Shore: I want to begin with a philosophical distinction between guilt and responsibility. Guilt is a posteriori &#x2013; that is, it is &#x201C;after the fact,&#x201D; so to speak: a person is guilty of something he or she did or failed to do. Guilt is contingent and depends upon choices and actions. But not-guilty does not mean not-responsible. Responsibility, I would argue, is not contingent. It is a priori; it precedes our choices or actions. We always already bear responsibility &#x2013; it is not dependent on anything we have or have not done. The source of this responsibility is not personal guilt; the source of this responsibility is being in the world. With respect to Vergangenheitsbew&#xE4;ltigung (&#x201C;Dealing with the past&#x201D; in German), I think the Germans &#x2014; to generalize &#x2014; have conflated guilt with responsibility. They have largely accepted inherited guilt for the past but continue, it seems to me, to fail to take responsibility in the present. I don&#x2019;t actually believe in inherited guilt &#x2014; I don&#x2019;t think we are guilty of what our parents or grandparents or ancestors did in times past. I do, though, believe that we are all responsible for looking at what they did with eyes wide open, telling the truth, and working to repair the consequences in the present. With respect to Russia, I agree very much with the Russian novelist Sergei Lebedev that a failure to face the truth of past crimes is a crucial source of what Ukrainian author Volodymyr Rafeyenko described to me as the &#x201C;anthropological catastrophe&#x201D; of Russian society. I think it is connected to a failure of subjectivity, a failure to take hold of oneself as a responsible agent, &#xA0;a subject as opposed to an object. The Russians alive today are not guilty of Stalinist crimes &#x2014; with very few remaining exceptions, those who are guilty are no longer living. But Russians today are responsible for looking at those crimes honestly and telling the truth about them &#x2014; and they have, by and large, failed in that. It&#x2019;s admittedly not an easy task &#x2014; unlike for Germans looking back at Nazism, for Russians looking back at Stalinism, there is no clear dividing line between victim and oppressor. To have lived under Stalinism was both to have been victimized by it and to have been implicated in it. Tetyana Ogarkova has a brilliant line about this: &#x201C;In a liberal society, everyone has a skeleton in the closet, but in a totalitarian society, everyone has a corpse at home.&#x201D; In their joint essay in the recent special issue of Irish Pages devoted to the war, Ogarkova and Volodymyr Yermolenko write about Russia as a place with &#x201C;crime without punishment and punishment without crime.&#x201D; The society is divided into these gangster oligarch-types enjoying total impunity &#x2013; and the masses of people who can be taken away and imprisoned or killed for nothing at all. There&#x2019;s a key here to the crisis of subjectivity in Russia. In both cases, no one is really a responsible agent &#x2014; it&#x2019;s all &#xDC;bermenschian untouchability or helplessness in the face of arbitrariness. An additional distinction is important: between inherited guilt and collective guilt. I do think that collective guilt is real but much more difficult to talk about and parse than individual guilt. Hannah Arendt writes in &#x201C;Organized Guilt and Universal Responsibility&#x201D; that &#x201C;When all are guilty, nobody in the last analysis can be judged.&#x201D; In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Vladimir Kara-Murza referenced just this line by Arendt, explaining that for him, to assign all Russians guilt for war crimes is essentially to assign guilt to no one. I sense what he meant was that the moral risk of saying all Russians are guilty is that it is effectively saying that it doesn&#x2019;t matter what one does or what one chooses.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)When, during the first Trump administration, American border guards were taking refugee children away from their parents on the U.S.-Mexican border and throwing them in cages, I knew that I, too, was implicated. I wasn&#x2019;t silent, of course; I spoke out and protested, etc. However, even so, I am part of this society, and I failed to stop it. When we learned the election results on the night of Nov. 5-6, I thought to myself: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t and can&#x2019;t expect the world to ever forgive us for this.&#x201D; And I think a lot about what I would do if I were Russian, how brave I would or wouldn&#x2019;t be. And I think a lot about what the German philosopher Karl Jaspers wrote about the war, &#x201C;That I live after such a thing has happened weighs upon me as indelible guilt.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent: From a historian&#x2019;s perspective, what insights do past traumas like the Holocaust or Soviet purges offer us in these dark times? Is there something we&#x2019;re missing? Marci Shore: Nothing goes away. Silence doesn&#x2019;t make anything disappear. National mythology will always veer toward falsehood: there have been no such people or nations who have been innocent since time eternal. My desperate hope for Ukrainian society is that despite and through all the trauma, there will be a time after victory where there will be a rebuilding &#x2013; and that rebuilding will take place on a foundation of truth, that a new generation will not be afraid to look as well at Ukraine&#x2019;s own past with eyes wide open, that Ukraine will not find itself decades from now in the state of being that much of Israeli society under (Benjamin) Netanyahu finds itself in. (Ukrainian writer) Victoria Amelina, not long before she was murdered by a Russian missile in Kramatorsk, wrote a short essay called &#x201C;Nothing Bad Has Ever Happened.&#x201D; She wrote about her native Lviv and about the denial that anything bad had ever happened in her own country &#x2014; she found the denial alienating: a home would only be a home when the ghosts, too, were invited for breakfast. I think of it (the essay) as a gift that Vika left for us, a point of departure for a relationship to the past and to ourselves built on truth. The Kyiv Independent: There is a renewed push to reform Slavic Studies since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In your view, what will be some of the most pressing questions for future scholars of Ukraine, Russia, and the surrounding region? Marci Shore: There are so many pressing questions in so many different fields. Perhaps some of the obvious ones at the moment: what can we learn from studying the comparative development of civil society in, say, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, Georgia, etc. post-1991? There&#x2019;s Masha Gessen&#x2019;s implicit question in &#x201C;The Future is History:&#x201D; Why did Bolotnaya (protests in Moscow) fail? Why were they not able to do in Russia what Ukrainians were able to do on the Maidan two years later? What can we learn by trying on different lenses and different prisms? I was just at a workshop called &#x201C;Dilemma&#x201D; in Yerevan centered around the Black Sea as a focal point for identity. How can Russophone literature be reconceptualized in its multinational layers? The developing field of environmental history is wide open. How can we understand Russian imperialism in terms of both its continuities and discontinuities across time and its similarities and differences with other imperialisms across space? How did it happen that in the case of Russia and Ukraine, subjectivity emerged precisely on the part of the colonized and not the colonizers? I would add that we are still struggling to grasp the Soviet experiment. It was arguably the largest, grandest, most penetrating, and far-reaching social engineering experiment ever performed on mankind. We are still grappling with the sheer scale of that experiment and the sheer scale of the catastrophe.

(Stringer / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: From countless videos filmed on cell phones to drone footage and recorded testimonies, the war in Ukraine is truly the most documented in our history. Yet, the gravity of events like the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and subsequent flooding of Kherson Oblast seems to have passed a lot of people by. I was wondering if, as someone who works with archives and testimonies, you had advice for people not to get lost in this sea of information. Marci Shore: This is a huge problem, and there are multiple aspects. One is just sheer volume: no one can process this much information in real time. We&#x2019;re all deluged and overwhelmed, and just triaging the information takes a lot of energy. This does not necessarily imply any bad faith or ill will at all &#x2014; it&#x2019;s just a question of volume. How much do you and I know about the atrocities taking place in Sudan? It&#x2019;s impossible to pay attention to every place and everyone who deserves our attention. The second problem does involve ill will and bad faith, and that&#x2019;s the problem we can describe as post-truth or disinformation. Peter Pomerantsev makes a point very clearly in the introduction to &#x201C;This is Not Propaganda&#x201D; that I&#x2019;ve been preoccupied with as well: in communist times, truth was actively suppressed. And dissidents were willing to risk their lives to speak the truth &#x2014; with the faith that truth itself had a power. Now the problem is not that truth is suppressed, but that truth is drowned out in the floods composed of truth, post-truth, lies, trivialities, distractions. I wish I had a decisive antidote for this. The best I&#x2019;ve been able to do for myself is follow certain sources &#x2014; publications, journalists, and individuals I trust. The Kyiv Independent: How might people&#x2019;s understanding of democracy, freedom, and resilience evolve because of Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russian aggression? Do you think it will prompt people &#x2014; or does it already &#x2014; to reconsider their understanding of national identity, colonial struggles, and other similar issues? Marci Shore: I have many more hopes than I do predictions. I fantasize that the world will survive and we will see a time &#x201C;after the victory&#x201D; when Ukraine is rebuilt not to &#x201C;catch up&#x201D; with the West, but to be the new avant-garde: rebuilt to rely on clean energy, to embrace a cosmopolitan civic identity, to reject national mythology in favor of critical truths. I can also say that for me what this war has laid bare is not so much a new understanding of democracy &#x2014; as we&#x2019;ve just seen in the U.S., democracy is not a guarantee against tyranny. Democracy and liberalism are not the same thing. People can democratically choose fascism. For me what the war has laid bare above all are questions about good and evil, and returning to those categories, to that ontological distinction. The Kyiv Independent: I&#x2019;ve always disliked the term &#x201C;Orcs&#x201D; for Russian soldiers &#x2014; not out of sympathy, but because it is an attempt to distance their actions from the reality that people are capable of committing horrific crimes. The nearly 150,000 war crimes were committed in Ukraine not only by violent criminals but those who had so-called ordinary lives before the full-scale war. Do you think the othering of the enemy, in this case, is a sort of coping mechanism for a world that refuses to accept that peace is not a given? Marci Shore: These are the classic questions. I tend to believe that the demographic of hard-core sadistic psychopaths is marginal, although grossly overrepresented in positions of power. But there are not enough sadistic psychopaths to carry out mass atrocity on this scale without massive participation by those Christopher Browning famously called &#x201C;ordinary men.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not clear to me that our understanding has progressed dramatically beyond what we read in Christopher Browning&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ordinary Men&#x201D; and Arendt&#x2019;s &#x201C;Eichmann in Jerusalem&#x201D; and Slavenka Drakulic&#x2019;s &#x201C;They Would Never Hurt a Fly,&#x201D; the latter of which is a series of portraits of Yugoslav war criminals from the 1990s. Drakulic, who herself is from what was Yugoslavia and is now Croatia, went to the Hague and listened to these war crimes trials. And like Arendt listening to Eichmann, Slavenka was listening in her own language, there was an intimacy there. We have Stanley Milgram&#x2019;s study from the 1960s, which I still teach &#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know that we&#x2019;ve gotten much further. I remember being an undergraduate at Stanford and hearing my first lecture about the Milgram study. And I remember that the professor giving the lecture said to us, &#x201C;If you listen to all this and think: I would never have given any electric shocks, then you&#x2019;ve missed the point.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/historian-marci-shore-putins-obsession-with-denazification-is-freudian-projection/	2024-12-26T09:36:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151587755-1.jpg
Russia closes all 4 Moscow airports for unspecified 'safety' concerns	Russia temporarily suspended flights at all four airports operating in Moscow on Dec. 26, citing safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) announced. A fifth airport in Kaluga was also closed. &quot;To ensure the safety of civil aircraft flights, temporary restrictions have been introduced on the operation of Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Zhukovsky and Kaluga airports,&quot; Rosaviatsiya said on Dec. 26. The agency did not specify the cause of the security concerns. All airports were reopened after temporary closure. Moscow has previously shut down its airports amid drone strikes over the region. Ukraine launched its largest drone attack against Moscow in November 2024. The latest announcement comes as Russian air defense operations are under scrutiny due to the crash of an Azerbaijani Airlines plane in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. The crash was reportedly caused by a Russian air defense missile, according to a preliminary investigation. The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-closes-all-4-moscow-airports-for-unspecified-safety-concerns/	2024-12-26T09:18:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1243734669-1.jpg
Increase in enemy activity' — governor on Russia's assaults in Kherson Oblast	Russia&apos;s sabotage groups are trying to gain a foothold and have increased the number of attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 on national television. Prokudin&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. &quot;We are observing an increase in enemy activity. We understand the places where enemy airborne groups can land, and the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces are ready to destroy them,&quot; Prokudin said. Attacks are &quot;not rare,&quot; and Russian soldiers are trying to gain a foothold on the western bank of the Dnipro regularly, according to the governor. However, none of these attempts have been successful, he added. Russian diversionary groups are trying to gain a foothold on the islands near Kherson or on the western bank of the river every day, Prokudin said, adding that &quot;all the diversionists were eliminated.&quot; The Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-observing-increase-in-enemy-activity-governor-on-russias-assaults-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-12-26T08:34:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2149869538.jpg
Thailand accepts Russia's invitation to join BRICS	Thailand has accepted Russia&apos;s invitation to become a BRICS partner state, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nikondet Phalangkun said at a press briefing on Dec. 26. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a bloc of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. &quot;On October 31, Thailand received an invitation to become a BRICS partner state from Russia, the group&apos;s chair in 2024,&quot; Phalangkun said. &quot;On December 24, the Cabinet of Ministers held a meeting and decided that Thailand would respond positively to the invitation.&quot; The government believes that joining the economic alliance will carry benefits for Thailand across a number of sectors. &quot;(M)embership in BRICS will benefit Thailand by promoting trade, investment, food and energy security,&quot; Phalangkun said. Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a BRICS forum in Kazan in October 2024. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders participated in the summit. Following the event, Putin said that invitations would be sent to a number of proposed new partner countries. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined BRICS at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Thailand opted to remain neutral after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Bangkok did not impose sanctions on Moscow or send weapons to Kyiv, but did later vote in favor of multiple United Nations resolutions calling for Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/thailand-accepts-russias-invitation-to-join-brics/	2024-12-26T08:19:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157382812.jpg
18 Russian soldiers allegedly killed in Ukraine's Dec. 25 attack in Kursk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops hit a Russian command post in the town of Lgov in Kursk Oblast, allegedly killing 18 Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported on Dec. 26. Ukrainian forces reportedly hit the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade, located in an abandoned civilian building in Lgov, overnight on Dec. 25. Following the attack, Kursk Oblast Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein claimed that Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. The strike killed 18 personnel and partially destroyed the command post, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications claimed in a Dec. 26 statement. A deputy brigade commander was most likely among the killed, and most of the killed soldiers were staff officers. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops, who have been fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/18-russian-soldiers-allegedly-killed-in-ukraines-dec-25-attack-in-kursk-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-26T07:27:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151581445-1.jpg
Russian shadow fleet tanker likely caused damage to undersea power cable, Finland says	Recent damage to the Estlink 2 power cable in the Gulf of Finland was likely caused by a Russian tanker believed to be a part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; Finnish police announced in a press conference on Dec. 26. The Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to be seriously damaged on Christmas Day. Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible act of sabotage. The anchor of the Russian vessel Eagle S appears to have caused the damage to the cable, authorities said, according to the Finnish media outlet Yle. The Eagle S was detained in Finnish territorial waters and investigators are gathering evidence and conducting interviews with the crew ahead of an expected trial. The ship likely belongs to Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, a group of vessels employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions, Finnish customs officials said. Investigators are still working to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. The Estlink 2 has remained offline since the incident and repair to the cable could take months, threatening the power supply in the winter season. The Finnish and Estonian governments are holding emergency meetings to assess the situation. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said that Helsinki has not been in contact with Moscow. &quot;The government is doing everything it can to address the issue,&quot; Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said. &quot;The shadow fleet is also a major risk to other Baltic littoral states and the rest of the EU.&quot; Orpo said Russia&apos;s ongoing war against Ukraine led to the incident. &quot;Shadow ships are pumping money into Russia&apos;s war chest so that Russia can continue its war against Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;These ships are constantly being listed on sanctions lists, and this has already had a major impact.&quot; Nordic countries have been on high alert due to increasing security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes, in Nordic countries. Finland investigated Russia&apos;s possible role in damaging an underwater gas pipeline in fall 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the notion as &quot;complete rubbish.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-likely-caused-damage-to-undersea-power-cable-finland-says/	2024-12-26T07:04:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190806016.jpg
‘Praise is not practice’ – Snyder’s new book challenges America’s understanding of freedom through comparison with Ukraine	In his latest book, &#x201C;On Freedom,&#x201D; American scholar Timothy Snyder establishes a thought-provoking distinction between the word &quot;liberation&quot; and the Ukrainian wartime variant &quot;de-occupation&quot; to probe the fraught but necessary question: When is a person truly free? Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has left countless settlements in ruins and displaced millions. Those who have fled face the uncertainty of carrying on with their lives elsewhere, while those returning to areas liberated by Ukrainian forces, if possible, must rebuild. Snyder describes visiting the village of Yahidne in Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Chernihiv Oblast, where during the occupation, Russian soldiers forced nearly the entire village &#x2014; more than 360 people &#x2014; into the school basement at gunpoint. The locals would spend a month there, in inhumane conditions, used as human shields for the Russian soldiers&#x2019; headquarters upstairs. Eleven of them would not make it out alive. &#x201C;A liberation suggests that a woe has dissipated,&#x201D; Snyder writes. &#x201C;But the adults need support, the children a new school. It is so very important that (the village) is no longer occupied. But it would be wrong to end the story of Yahidne when the survivors emerged from underground.&#x201D; Snyder&#x2019;s concerns are valid &#x2014; although nearly three years have passed since the occupation of Yahidne, Ukrainian journalists have reported on ongoing scandals surrounding the reconstruction of the village that came to be one of the many settlements symbolizing the horrors of Russian aggression. While &#x201C;On Freedom&#x201D; primarily focuses on the United States, Snyder&#x2019;s reflections on Ukraine, enriched by his expertise as a historian of European history and particularly that of the former Soviet Union, make the book a compelling read for a broad audience, offering both a stark warning and a much-needed declaration of moral clarity in an era increasingly defined by rising authoritarianism. There is, first and foremost, a necessity, as Snyder argues, to rescue the word freedom from &#x201C;overuse and abuse.&#x201D; Defining what drives freedom is crucial to understanding the true extent of it. In this context, the comparison Snyder ultimately draws between countries like the U.S. and Ukraine is striking. Snyder suggests that we can conceive of freedom in two ways: as freedom from something or as freedom to do something. The former, the cornerstone of American identity &#x2014; originally freedom from British tyranny &#x2014; presents a vision many Americans believe is assured by birthright. It is what he also calls &#x201C;negative freedom:&#x201D; the absence of occupation, oppression, or even government. Yet, Snyder warns, this belief in freedom from something is vulnerable to malevolent distortion. Those in power can easily mislead the public into forfeiting their rights by disguising the act as a safeguard against both tangible and perceived threats, such as the expanded surveillance abilities of law enforcement after the 9/11 terrorist attacks during U.S. President George W. Bush&#x2019;s administration. A woman faces the door with the calendar and names of the people who died in the basement of the school where Russian occupiers held more than 300 residents, including 77 children, captive from March 3 to 30, 2022, in Yahidne, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Jan. 17, 2024. (Kirill Chubotin / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Snyder contends that symbols like the American flag, seen as emblems of freedom, can sometimes also substitute for the actual practice of it. History offers many instances where the freedoms these symbols represent excluded certain groups, with racial inequality in the U.S. serving as a recurring example throughout the book. True freedom, Snyder argues, is not rooted in endlessly glorifying past achievements but in the courage to confront what must be done to uphold and expand freedom for all. As he aptly states, &#x201C;praise is not practice.&#x201D; &#x201C;It is easy to imagine that freedom will be brought to us by a song, by jets over a stadium, by the land, by the ancestors, by the Founders, by capitalism,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;But is the notion that we are granted freedom right for a &#x2018;home of the brave&#x2019;?&#x201D; &#x201C;Is it not more courageous to ask what Americans have done, could have done, should do?&#x201D; The Cold War offers us a telling example. As Snyder notes, it was a &#x201C;moral challenge&#x201D; for the U.S. &#x2014; Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a witch hunt for communist influence in the country, destroying many innocent people&#x2019;s lives and careers with baseless accusations. The U.S. government also supported right-wing dictatorships in Latin America to suppress even moderate socialist movements. At the same time, &#x201D;the Soviet challenge had also pushed America toward some strengths,&#x201D; including a manned mission to the moon, substantial investments in education, and the promotion of cultural diplomacy abroad. While not without flaws, U.S. policy during the Cold War demonstrated a commitment to investing in its population and protecting it through robust structures. This approach helped to underscore the perceived superiority of the American model over that of the USSR. &#x201C;Whether we will be free will depend on us,&#x201D; as Snyder writes. &#x201C;Not just on what we do, but on why we do it: our ideals.&#x201D; The genocidal nature of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &#x2014; marked by the deliberate destruction of cultural sites and the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children &#x2014; might have some think that Ukraine&apos;s struggle is simply the fight for freedom from Russia. Yet, the Ukrainians that Snyder speaks with during his visits to the wartime country tell him about freedom in a fundamentally different way than Americans perceive it. Their viewpoint aligns with most other countries, to be more precise &#x2014; and this is what makes all of them happier, healthier, and ultimately more well off. For Ukrainians, the war is not framed as only a fight for freedom from Russia but rather about the freedom to live on their own terms. This vision of freedom is one rooted in self-determination, where Ukrainians strive for autonomy and the right to shape their own future without Russian interference or domination. &#x201C;The occupiers had gotten in the way of a sense that the world was opening up (for Ukrainians), that the next generation would have a better life, that decisions made now would matter in years to come,&#x201D; Snyder writes. Ukrainian military veteran Viacheslav Rybachuk, whose brother, a Ukrainian soldier Oleksiy, was killed in the Bakhmut area in 2023, kneels down at a designated area for commemorating fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters during the Independence Day of Ukraine in the Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on Aug. 24, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;A soldier in a rehabilitation center told me that freedom was about everyone having a chance to fulfill their own purposes after the war. A veteran awaiting a prosthesis said that freedom would be a smile on his son&#x2019;s face. A young soldier on leave said that freedom was about the children he would like to have.&#x201D; Snyder also explores how access to knowledge and an openness to engage meaningfully with the world around us are integral to a free society &#x2014; ideals that countries like Russia actively seek to undermine. He highlights how Ukraine has had to confront Russia&#x2019;s attempts to manipulate global perceptions of the war through contradictory narratives, such as claims that the Ukrainian language is &#x201C;not real&#x201D; while also alleging that Ukrainians are &#x201C;forced&#x201D; to speak it over Russian, or the paradoxical assertions that Ukraine is a country of Nazis but also one that promotes LGBTQ+ values and is involved in some sort of Jewish conspiracy. As Snyder writes, &#x201C;the simple fact that Russia had invaded a neighboring country got lost on social media,&#x201D; with online platforms becoming battlegrounds for narratives debating whether the invasion was &#x201C;justified.&#x201D; He critiques this distraction, noting, &#x201C;Americans and others wasted outrage on phantoms even as a real war of aggression began.&#x201D; Reading Snyder&apos;s &quot;On Freedom&quot; evokes an even more somber undertone in the aftermath of Donald Trump&apos;s 2024 presidential victory in the U.S., which was marked by his repeated assertions that there &quot;wouldn&apos;t be a country anymore&quot; if he lost &#x2014; a mantra designed to incite fear among his base and sway undecided voters. While conservative pundits tout the &quot;future looks bright&quot; for the country, others voice growing concerns over potential erosions of freedoms, including minority rights and women&apos;s health, given the declarations Trump and his allies made on the campaign trail. Simultaneously, Russia appears emboldened amid uncertainty over the future of U.S. military aid for Kyiv, escalating aerial assaults across the country and intensifying efforts to occupy more territory in Ukraine&#x2019;s east. Ukrainian officials also face mounting pressure to agree on negotiations for a ceasefire, all while recognizing that Moscow&#x2019;s ultimate goal of exterminating the Ukrainian national idea remains unchanged. The prospects for 2025 and beyond may appear grim, yet Snyder encourages readers to remain steadfast and resolute: &#x201C;Fear is not enough. It will not get us where we need to go. From the most basic facts we can build a scaffolding of hope.&#x201D; By grounding ourselves in fundamental moral truths rather than intoxicating ourselves with dangerous rhetoric, we can begin to construct not just resistance against authoritarian forces but a framework of hope and substantive action to better the world. Engaging with sometimes uncomfortable inquiries about oneself, one&#x2019;s community, and one&apos;s country is not merely an intellectual exercise but a necessity for genuine clarity and self-awareness. This act of reclaiming agency &#x2014; choosing hope over fear &#x2014; is itself a crucial step toward safeguarding freedom. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article. There is an ever-increasing amount of books about or related to Ukraine available to English-language readers, and I hope my recommendations prove useful when it comes to your next trip to the bookstore. Ukrainian culture has taken on an even more important meaning during wartime, so if you like reading about this sort of thing, please consider supporting The Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/praise-is-not-practice-snyders-new-book-challenges-americas-understanding-of-freedom-through-comparison-with-ukraine/	2024-12-26T06:13:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2_books.jpg
Azerbaijani government sources claim Russian missile caused plane crash over Kazakhstan, Euronews reports	A Russian surface-to-air missile caused the crash of the Azerbaijan Airlines flight near Aktau, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijani government sources reportedly confirmed to Euronews on Dec. 26. The plane, en route from Baku to Grozny, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny on Dec. 25. According to Euronews sources, shrapnel from the explosion reportedly struck the passengers and cabin crew as the missile detonated mid-flight near the aircraft. The reported use of air defense systems aligns with multiple media reports of drone attacks in Chechnya on the morning of Dec. 25. The aircraft attempted to land in Grozny, but Russian airports reportedly denied it permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Footage analyzed by independent media outlets Meduza and Mediazona shows damage consistent with surface-to-air missile impacts, including holes in the fuselage and traces of a missile strike on the tail section. Survivors recounted hearing an explosion before the failed landing attempts in Grozny. Upon trying to land in Aktau, the plane broke apart on impact and caught fire. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially attributed the crash to a collision with a flock of birds, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. The black box from the crash site has been recovered, and Azerbaijani media reported that its analysis will be critical in confirming the events leading up to the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-airlines-crash-in-kazakhstan-allegedly-linked-to-russian-missile-strike-euronews-reports/	2024-12-26T05:46:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast endure heavy losses, logistical struggles, Ukrainian military intelligence says	North Korean troops deployed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast continue to suffer significant losses, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 26. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka reportedly inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean troops. HUR confirmed the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, with additional losses recorded at multiple sites. Despite sanitary losses, including five soldiers on Dec. 20 alone, Russian officers ordered the units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical issues for North Korean units on the front lines, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities. However, Russian forces have continued supplying these troops with ammunition and food to sustain their positions and resume assault operations. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their inexperience with the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. While North Korean forces have proven vulnerable to Ukrainian drone strikes, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited gains in the region, recapturing some territory previously held by Ukrainian forces. The use of North Korean troops in ground assaults marks an escalation of their involvement in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, raising concerns about Moscow&#x2019;s growing reliance on Pyongyang for military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast-face-heavy-losses-logistical-struggles-hur-reports/	2024-12-26T05:37:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Willingness to support Ukraine 'until it wins' drops significantly in Western Europe, poll says	Public willingness to support Ukraine &#x201C;until it wins&#x201D; has dropped significantly across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., according to a YouGov poll reported by The Guardian on Dec. 26. The survey, conducted between Dec. 3-18, highlights growing skepticism about prolonged support for Kyiv as the war with Russia drags on. In Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., support for Ukraine&#x2019;s victory remains relatively high at 50%, 40%, and 36%, respectively. However, these figures represent notable declines from January levels of 57%, 51%, and 50%. Meanwhile, the share of respondents favoring a negotiated peace has risen &#x2014; reaching 55% in Italy, 46% in Spain, 45% in Germany, and 43% in France &#x2014; up by eight-10 points in each country over the year. While many respondents across Western Europe oppose a settlement requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, there is widespread concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may reduce or withdraw American support for Ukraine after his inauguration on Jan. 20. Notably, in France, Germany, and Sweden, the percentage of people hoping for Ukraine&#x2019;s outright victory has remained stable since early 2023, though overall willingness to continue support until victory has declined elsewhere. In Poland, a CBOS poll on Dec. 17 showed a dramatic shift in public opinion, with 55% of respondents favoring an end to the conflict even if it means Ukraine ceding territory &#x2014; a sharp rise from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Support for Ukraine fighting without concessions has dropped to 31%, compared to 46% in September and 59% in April 2022. The contrasting attitudes underscore Ukraine&apos;s challenges as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. These changes in public sentiment could complicate Kyiv&#x2019;s efforts to sustain international backing in its defense against Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/willingness-to-support-ukraine-until-it-wins-drops-significantly-in-western-europe-poll-says/	2024-12-26T04:39:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-486250819.jpg
Polish PM Tusk slams Hungary’s Orban for praising Putin amid Ukraine attacks	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for calling Vladimir Putin Hungary&apos;s &#x201C;honest partner&#x201D; during Russia&#x2019;s massive missile attacks on Ukraine on Christmas Day, according to a Dec. 26 statement on X. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones on Dec. 25, striking multiple Ukrainian cities. Kharkiv faced &#x201C;massive fire&#x201D; from ballistic missiles, injuring six, according to local authorities. Tusk highlighted the contrast between Orban&#x2019;s remarks and the reality of the attacks, saying, &#x201C;On Christmas Eve, Russia launched a massive missile attack on Ukrainian cities. At the same time, in a Christmas interview, Prime Minister Orban called Putin an honest partner of the Hungarians.&#x201D; Orban&#x2019;s remarks highlight Hungary&apos;s ongoing ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Hungary has frequently opposed EU sanctions on Russia and blocked military aid to Ukraine. On Dec. 16, Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry denounced Hungary&#x2019;s &quot;peacekeeping&quot; rhetoric as manipulative, accusing Orban&#x2019;s government of advocating for Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender and obstructing international efforts to support Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-slams-hungarys-orban-for-praising-putin-amid-ukraine-attacks/	2024-12-26T03:39:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2119755509.jpg
Ukraine hits ballistic missile propellant plant in Rostov Oblast, Stratcom reports	The Ukrainian Air Force struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky, Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported on Dec. 26. These missiles are reportedly used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, including hospitals, residential buildings, and power plants. &#x201C;This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,&#x201D; Stratcom said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. On Dec. 24, drones struck the military airbase in Millerovo, according to local acting governor Yury Slyusar. Earlier, on Dec. 19, Ukraine&#x2019;s Navy and the SBU carried out a combined strike on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast. These operations are part of Ukraine&#x2019;s broader efforts to disrupt Russia&#x2019;s military supply chain and hinder its ability to conduct attacks on Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-ballistic-missile-propellant-plant-in-rostov-oblast-stratcom-reports/	2024-12-26T03:04:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165947283.jpg
Russian drone attack on central Nikopol market injures 6, officials report	Russian forces struck the central market in Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, with a drone on Dec. 26, injuring six people, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Those injured, four women and two men, received first aid from rescuers and medics before being transported to the hospital. Governor Serhii Lysak confirmed the injuries and said three women, aged 39, 63, and 64, are in serious condition. &#x201C;They are are being provided with all the necessary medical care,&#x201D; he said. The attack caused significant damage to commercial premises, according to emergency responders. This assault follows a Dec. 24 strike on a residential building in Kryvyi Rih, also in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The Christmas Eve attack injured at least 15 people and killed one, according to Lysak.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-central-nikopol-market-injures-6-officials-report/	2024-12-26T01:44:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-26_09-53-45.jpg
Russian luxury market thrives despite sanctions through shadow networks, FT reports	Russian shoppers continue to access luxury Western brands despite sanctions imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 26. An industry of personal buyers, resellers, and cross-border smugglers has emerged, allowing affluent Russians to circumvent restrictions. The European Union has limited legal sales of luxury goods to Russia to items priced under 300 euros ($312), far below the typical cost of high-end fashion. Customs records reportedly reveal that trade is being diverted through intermediaries in countries where such sanctions do not apply. In September, over 300 Italian-made Bottega Veneta handbags, averaging $1,800 each, were shipped from Dubai to Russia by a Chinese reseller. Western designer brands remain accessible in Russia, with Moscow retail consultancy IBC Real Estate noting that half of the major brands present in 2020 are still introducing new collections. Some businesses have adjusted their offerings to avoid falling under sanctions. The sanctions have fueled a boom in intermediary services. A personal buyer in Italy told The Financial Times that he sends 10 to 20 packages weekly to Russia, earning up to 6,000 euros ($6,238) in commissions. Latvian customs officials reported rejecting 60 shipments of luxury goods with suspiciously low declared values since the beginning of the year. Intermediaries often disguise shipments as personal purchases by removing tags or altering packaging. These practices carry risks for Western companies, which can be held liable for export violations if their products reach Russia. BMW announced on Dec. 23 that it had dismissed employees involved in exporting over 100 luxury cars from Germany to Russian buyers in violation of sanctions. A Russian oligarch also illegally imported a $110 million Airbus A320neo from the EU, defying sanctions, The Moscow Times reported earlier this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-luxury-market-thrives-despite-sanctions-through-shadow-networks-ft-reports/	2024-12-26T01:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Russia's inflation hits year-high, driven by war spending, food price hikes, Rosstat says	Inflation in Russia has reached its highest levels in nearly a year, driven by war spending and rising food prices, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 25, citing Russia&apos;s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). To curb accelerating inflation fueled by war expenditures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has raised its interest rate from 7.5% in July 2023 to the current 21% &#x2014; the highest level since the early 2000s. Consumer prices rose 0.33% during the week of Dec. 17-23, pushing year-to-date inflation to 9.5%, surpassing the 2022 annual rate of 7.4%. Annual inflation now stands at 9.7%, with food prices surging by 11.41% &#x2014; the steepest increase since October 2022. Essential goods have seen dramatic price hikes since the start of the year, including potatoes (90.5%), onions (46.6%), cabbage (46.6%), and butter (35%). The Central Bank&#x2019;s aggressive interest rate hikes have drawn criticism, particularly from Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Sergei Chemezov, CEO of state-owned defense giant Rostec, warned in October that continued rate increases could bankrupt businesses. However, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina maintains that the high rate is essential to curb inflation, a view echoed by opposition politician Vladimir Milov. Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November, &#x201C;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a high rate. Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because... there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&#x201D; The Central Bank is expected to reassess the feasibility of further rate hikes in its next meeting as it struggles to balance inflation control with economic stability. Rising costs of basic goods, coupled with internal economic pressures from the war, highlight the financial challenges Russia faces under its strained war economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-inflation-hits-year-high-driven-by-war-spending-food-price-hikes-rosstat-says/	2024-12-26T00:45:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2155642507.jpg
Russian companies increasingly using Bitcoin amid sanctions, Reuters reports	Russian companies are increasingly using Bitcoin and other digital currencies for international payments in response to Western sanctions, Reuters reported on Dec. 25. Once key facilitators of Russia&#x2019;s trade, Chinese banks have significantly curtailed transactions over fears of losing access to U.S. financial markets. By mid-2024, roughly 80% of Russian payments in Chinese yuan were reportedly rejected or returned. The shift follows legislative changes in Russia allowing cryptocurrencies in foreign trade to counter the impact of sanctions. Moscow has embraced cryptocurrencies, including legalizing Bitcoin mining. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed during a Russia-24 interview that domestically mined Bitcoin is now being used in foreign trade under an experimental framework. &#x201C;Such transactions are already occurring,&#x201D; Siluanov said, emphasizing that digital currencies could become a key tool in international payments. Sanctions have heavily restricted Russia&#x2019;s access to traditional financial markets. Both the U.S. and the EU banned the export of dollars and euros to Russia in March 2022, reducing their use in trade. Chinese yuan initially filled the gap, becoming the most traded foreign currency in Russia. However, expanded U.S. sanctions targeting financial institutions doing business with Russia have further constrained payment options. Russia and China have reportedly discussed barter-based trade as another mechanism to navigate sanctions-related payment challenges, Reuters reported earlier in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-turns-to-cryptocurrency-for-international-trade-amid-sanctions/	2024-12-25T23:45:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1384895902.jpg
Biden directs Pentagon to 'continue its surge' of weapons deliveries to Ukraine after Russia's Christmas attack	U.S. President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to &quot;continue its surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Ukraine in response to Russia&apos;s mass attack on the country on Christmas Day, he announced on Dec. 25. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones on Dec. 25, striking multiple cities and causing damage. Kharkiv endured &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, leaving six injured, according to local authorities. Biden condemned the attacks and pledged continued support for Ukraine until it defeats Russian aggression. &#x201C;The Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety,&#x201D; Biden said. He added that hundreds of air defense missiles have already been sent to Ukraine in recent months, with additional deliveries underway. Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses. &#x201C;The United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s position in its defense against Russian forces,&#x201D; he said. The strikes on Dec. 25 caused significant damage, prompting emergency blackouts in several Oblasts of Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, confirmed that Russian strikes severely damaged equipment at thermal power plants, though the locations were not disclosed. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, also criticized the assault, calling Christmas a &#x201C;time of peace.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-directs-pentagon-to-continue-its-surge-of-weapons-deliveries-to-ukraine-after-russias-christmas-attack/	2024-12-25T23:22:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg

Ukrainian poet and prose writer Oleksii Bezpaltsev killed in action	Oleksii Bezpaltsev, a 34-year-old poet and prose writer from Kharkiv, was killed in action while performing a combat mission in Kharkiv Oblast, PEN Ukraine reported on Dec. 25. Known for his modernist style, Bezpaltsev published two collections of short stories and participated in literary slams.

According to a March 2024 report from PEN International, at least 102 Ukrainian cultural figures, including writers, artists, translators and historians, have been killed since the beginning of the invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-poet-and-prose-writer-oleksii-bezpaltsev-killed-in-action/	2024-12-25T18:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/oleksii.jpg
Zelensky wishes Ukrainians peace and unity in third wartime Christmas address	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Christmas Eve address on Dec. 24 that Ukrainians continue to hold on to their faith, unity, and traditions during the third Christmas in wartime. Zelensky highlighted the cultural importance of Mykola Leontovych&apos;s &quot;Shchedryk,&quot; written in Pokrovsk, and its global association with the spirit of Christmas. &quot;Let everyone who hears it remember Ukraine, how we are fighting for the main symbol of this holiday &#x2013; for hope and victory,&quot; he said. &#x201C;This is our third Christmas during the war,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote. &#x201C;We cannot celebrate it fully &#x2013; not everyone is at home, not everyone has a home, and not everyone is with us.&#x201D; &#x201C;All we need is to live peacefully on our land, to see the sun, our sky, and in it &#x2013; the Christmas star, not Iranian drones and Russian missiles. The president called for prayers for soldiers, prisoners, and those in occupied territories, adding, &quot;Wherever we are today, we are together. As one big family, as one united nation.&quot; He concluded by wishing for peace, justice, and joy for all Ukrainians. &quot;We fight and pray for this. And we deserve it.&quot; Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Dec. 25, targeting cities across the country with missiles and drones. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was among the hardest hit, coming under &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wishes-ukrainians-peace-and-unity-in-third-wartime-christmas-address/	2024-12-25T16:01:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian air defense may have downed Azerbaijani plane, media say	Key developments on Dec. 25: The Azerbaijani Airlines plane that crashed on Dec. 25 en route to Russia may have been shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile, according to reports from independent Russian media outlets. The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty eight people have perished in the crash, according to the latest information. The potential use of air defense systems aligns with several media reports according to which Chechnya was attacked by drones on the morning of Dec. 25. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Survivors recalled hearing an explosion after failed landing attempts in Grozny, according to the independent Russian outlet Mediazona. The plane then turned back, crossing the Caspian Sea toward Kazakhstan. Upon attempting to land at Aktau Airport, it broke apart on impact and caught fire. Meduza and Mediazona also cited Russian pro-war Telegram channels which showed photographs of the crash that suggested the plane had been shot at. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. During the maneuver, the aircraft &quot;hit the ground.&quot; The black box has been recovered from the crash site, Azerbaijani media reported. Its analysis is expected to provide critical insights into the events leading up to the crash. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Dec. 25, targeting cities across the country with missiles and drones. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was among the hardest hit, coming under &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, according to local authorities. At least six people were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Explosions were also reported in Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, and the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk. A missile was also shot down over Chernivtsi Oblast, located in the West of Ukraine along the border with Romania and Moldova, Governor Ruslan Zaparanyuk reported. There were no casualties. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones, the Air Force said. Ukraine shot down 55 Kh-101/Kh-55/Kalibr cruise missiles and four Kh-59/Kh-69 missiles, as well as 54 Shahed-type drones and other types of drones, according to the report. Another 52 drones were &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;Every Russian massive strike takes time to prepare. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a conscious choice not only of targets but also of time and date,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Multiple cities in Ukraine imposed emergency blackouts following the attack. Ukrainian long-range drones attacked an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast in recent days, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 25. The Kadamovsky training ground, located near Novocherkassk in Rostov Oblast, is one of the largest in Russia. &#xA0;According to the source, the ammunition depot was completely destroyed by drones operated by the SBU. &quot;It was used by the enemy to supply its troops in the Kramatorsk sector (in Donetsk Oblast),&quot; the source said. &quot;Now the Russians have significant logistical difficulties, which significantly affect their ability to conduct combat operations.&quot;The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. This is the latest of several attacks on Rostov Oblast reported over the past week. Ukrainian drones targeted the city of Millerovo, which hosts a military airbase, overnight on Dec. 24, said Yury Slyusar, the local acting governor. Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the SBU also carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast on Dec. 19. Ukrainian-made Shchedryk unmanned aerial vehicle has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry announced on Dec. 25. The Shchedryk aerial vehicle consists of a control station and remotely piloted aircraft with silent electric motors. It has increased resistance to electronic warfare and can be tasked with monitoring the actions of Russian troops on the battlefield, according to the ministry. Shchedryk can operate both day and night and perform tasks when there is strong wind, frost, or heat. &quot;The capabilities of the aerial vehicle and its optical equipment allow it to operate from an altitude that is difficult to reach for most enemy air defense systems,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov said. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Ukrainian troops hit the command post of the 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade in the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast overnight on Dec. 25, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported. The Russian command post was located in an abandoned civilian building, the military claimed. &quot;This fire strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the ability of the Russian Armed Forces to coordinate military operations against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. According to Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of &#xA0;Kursk Oblast, Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. Russian Telegram channels shared videos purporting to show a damaged high-rise building and cars. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. In August, Kursk Oblast became the scene of intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops when Kyiv captured dozens of settlements. A senior General Staff official told Reuters in late November that Ukraine had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers has surpassed 3,000. Japan is poised to allocate an additional $3 billion dollars from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Dec. 25. In a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Zelensky expressed his gratitude for Japan&apos;s previous aid to Ukraine, which has totaled $12 billion and &quot;makes it possible to save thousands of lives.&quot; &quot;I told Prime Minister Ishiba about Russia&apos;s massive shelling of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure on Christmas night and thanked Japan for its readiness to work toward achieving a just and lasting peace as soon as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine received $1 billion from Japan and the U.K. through the World Bank&#x2019;s Growth Foundations Development Policy Loan (DPL) program on Dec. 24. The funds are intended for use in the social and humanitarian spheres.Zelensky also met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya during his visit to Kyiv back in mid-November.

Kellogg condemns Russia's mass attack against Ukraine on Christmas Day	President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, denounced Russia&apos;s mass attack on early Christmas morning, emphasizing that &quot;Christmas should be a time of peace.&quot; Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, was one of the hardest-hit cities in Russia&apos;s latest mass attack. Explosions were also heard as far west as the city of Ivano-Frankvivsk.&quot;Christmas should be a time of peace, yet Ukraine was brutally attacked on Christmas Day. Launching large-scale missile and drone attacks on the day of the Lord&#x2019;s birth is wrong,&quot; Kellogg wrote on Dec. 25 on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;The world is closely watching actions on both sides. The U.S. is more resolved than ever to bring peace to the region.&quot; Kellogg, 80, previously held key roles as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under President Trump, and served as a senior advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. Ukraine and the U.S. have agreed on a date for Kellogg&apos;s first visit to Kyiv in his capacity as peace envoy. While authorities didn&apos;t announce the specific date for security reasons, it is likely to take place before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine, suggesting he could negotiate a peace agreement that would satisfy both Ukraine and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-condemns-russias-mass-attack-against-ukraine-on-christmas-day/	2024-12-25T12:49:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russian air defense missile may have downed Azerbaijani plane, media say	The Azerbaijani Airlines plane that crashed on Dec. 25 en route to Russia may have been shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile, according to reports from independent Russian media outlets. The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty eight people have perished in the crash, according to the latest information. The potential use of air defense systems aligns with several media reports according to which Chechnya was attacked by drones on the morning of Dec. 25. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Survivors recalled hearing an explosion after failed landing attempts in Grozny, according to the independent Russian outlet Mediazona. The plane then turned back, crossing the Caspian Sea toward Kazakhstan. Upon attempting to land at Aktau Airport, it broke apart on impact and caught fire. Meduza and Mediazona also cited Russian pro-war Telegram channels which showed photographs of the crash that suggested the plane had been shot at. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. During the maneuver, the aircraft &quot;hit the ground.&quot; The black box has been recovered from the crash site, Azerbaijani media reported. Its analysis is expected to provide critical insights into the events leading up to the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-plane-crash/	2024-12-25T11:55:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
Japan to transfer $3 billion from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Zelensky says	Japan is poised to allocate an additional $3 billion dollars from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Dec. 25. In a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Zelensky expressed his gratitude for Japan&apos;s previous aid to Ukraine, which has totaled $12 billion and &quot;makes it possible to save thousands of lives.&quot; &quot;I told Prime Minister Ishiba about Russia&apos;s massive shelling of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure on Christmas night and thanked Japan for its readiness to work toward achieving a just and lasting peace as soon as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine received $1 billion from Japan and the U.K. through the World Bank&#x2019;s Growth Foundations Development Policy Loan (DPL) program on Dec. 24. The funds are intended for use in the social and humanitarian spheres. Zelensky also met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya during his visit to Kyiv back in mid-November. The two reportedly discussed Japan&apos;s growing concern over the reported presence of North Korean troops on the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Iwaya further underscored Japan&apos;s commitment to deepening its relationship with Ukraine, highlighting plans to expand economic cooperation and implement additional sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-japan-to-transfer-3-billion-in-aid-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-12-25T10:16:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/01a42da329c0131b0e76cef1e4724858_1731762990_extra_large.jpeg
Former top enlistment officer arrested after trying to flee abroad, investigators say	Yevhen Borysov, a former head of Odesa Oblast&apos;s military enlistment office, was arrested again in Kyiv on Dec. 25 after posting 39 million hryvnia ($931,652) bail and being released from a detention facility, the State Investigation Bureau said. The former official planned to hide from the authorities after his release from detention and flee abroad, the bureau said. In July 2023, Borysov was charged with illicit enrichment and violating military service regulations. The State Investgation Bureau said on Dec. 25 that, in addition to the previous charges, it had charged Borysov with forging documents to show he had sustained a combat injury, which resulted in him being paid additional compensation from April to June 2022, amounting to 165,480 hryvnias ($3,953). As part of the ongoing investigation by the State Bureau of Investigations, a court has transferred to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) two properties in the Spanish resort town of Marbella. The assets include a 857-square-meter house valued at 4 million euros and a 223.9-square-meter office worth 510,000 euros. The properties are registered to the former military commander&#x2019;s mother and wife. An investigation published by media outlet Ukrainska Pravda in June 2023 looked into the property acquired by Borysov&apos;s family, which he initially denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/dbr-former-head-of-odesas-military-enlistment-office-caught-likely-planned-to-flee-country/	2024-12-25T08:54:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/dbr-zatrimalo-kolishnogo-odeskogo-vijskkoma-a-jogo-neruhomist-v-italii-peredano-v-arma-1.jpeg
Russia ready to export gas to EU via routes bypassing Ukraine, official claims	Russia is ready to supply natural gas to Europe through alternative routes bypassing Ukraine, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak claimed on Dec. 25 on Russian state-controlled television. The declaration comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed during a press conference on Dec. 19 that Ukraine would not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, which is set to expire on Dec. 31. &#x201C;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Following Zelensky&apos;s confirmation, EU member states such as Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria raised their concerns, with their state-owned energy companies jointly advocating for the continuation of gas transit through Ukraine. Russian officials appear confident in Europe&apos;s reliance upon its natural gas industry. Only earlier this year did the EU finally introduce its first sanctions against Russia&apos;s gas industry, specifically targeting liquefied natural gas (LNG). &quot;In terms of logistics, Russian gas is the most beneficial, as well as in terms of price,&quot; Novak claimed, adding that Europeans have to pay more for American gas amid competition with China. In late August, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia could pursue alternative routes, including a planned gas hub via Turkey, if Kyiv failed to extend the transit deal. Apart from the Ukraine route, Russian gas is transported via the TurkStream pipeline, which crosses the Black Sea. Russia may also potentially ship liquified natural gas (LNG) in tankers. Meanwhile, the Nord Stream gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany has been non-operational since it was blown up in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-ready-to-export-gas-through-routes-other-than-ukraine-official-claims/	2024-12-25T07:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Is Putinism fascism by another name?	The term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; is increasingly used to describe the agenda and actions of the current Russian state under Russian President Vladimir Putin. Today&#x2019;s use of this label has three dimensions: It is a historical analogy to interpret present events, an expression of Ukraine&apos;s lived experience, and a scholarly classification enabling comparisons with other regimes. Understanding these perspectives sheds light on the ideological and practical dynamics behind Putinism and its impact on Ukraine and beyond. Characterizing Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist often serves as a diachronic analogy or metaphorical classification to better understand current developments in Russia and its occupied territories. Drawing parallels with historical events helps to highlight key features and challenges in contemporary Russia. Labeling Putin&#x2019;s regime as &#x201C;fascist&#x201D; aims to clarify for the general public the nature of events unfolding in Russia and in Ukrainian territories under its control. This comparison is justified by numerous parallels between Putin&#x2019;s domestic and foreign policies and those of Benito Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy and Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. By late 2024, political, social, ideological, and institutional similarities have accumulated. These range from the increasingly dictatorial and, in some respects, totalitarian characteristics of Putin&#x2019;s regime to the Kremlin&#x2019;s revanchist and genocidal tendencies in its external actions. Historian Timothy Snyder has also noted that Russia&#x2019;s official historical memory and political iconography have, in coded ways, become pro-fascist. In 2018, Snyder highlighted Ivan Ilyin, a right-wing intellectual from the inter- and post-war Russian emigration who admired Mussolini and Hitler. Under Putin, Ilyin has gained renewed prominence. Snyder describes Ilyin&#x2019;s work as providing &#x201C;a metaphysical and moral justification for political totalitarianism&#x201D; and &#x201C;practical outlines for a fascist state.&#x201D; Putin has openly celebrated Ilyin&#x2019;s ideas, and Ilyin&#x2019;s influence is evident in the rhetoric of Russian officials, including Dmitry Medvedev, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church. Putin&#x2019;s invocation of Ilyin was notably explicit in a speech marking the illegal annexation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts in September 2022. Putin concluded his remarks with an Ilyin quote: &#x201C;If I (Iliyn) consider Russia my Motherland, it means that I love, reflect, and think, sing, and speak in Russian; that I believe in the spiritual strength of the Russian people. Its spirit is my spirit; its destiny is my destiny; its suffering is my sorrow; its flowering is my joy.&#x201D; For Ukrainians, the term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; functions not only as a historical analogy but also as a verbal expression of collective trauma. Since Russia&apos;s invasion in 2014, Ukrainians have coined the term &#x201C;ruscism&#x201D; (a blend of &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;fascism,&quot; pronounced &#x201C;rashyzm&#x201D;) to describe the Kremlin&apos;s genocidal campaign against their nation. This neologism captures the shock and despair caused by Russia&apos;s relentless aggression, from airstrikes on civilians to cultural erasure. The terms &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; and &#x201C;ruscism&#x201D; are used by the Ukrainian government and society as rallying cries to mobilize domestic and international support against Russian aggression. These labels are meant to highlight the existential stakes of Russia&apos;s war of extermination for Ukraine. They signify that Russia&apos;s campaign is not merely about territorial conquest. Since 2022, Russia&#x2019;s revanchist ambitions have focused on annihilating Ukraine as an independent nation-state and distinct cultural community. In this, the Kremlin&apos;s words and actions align. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a New Year&apos;s address to the nation from Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on Dec. 31, 2022. (Mikhail Klimentyev/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)Even before Feb. 24, 2022, statements by Russian officials, lawmakers, and propagandists suggested that Moscow&#x2019;s goals extended beyond redrawing borders, restoring regional hegemony, or resisting the Westernization of Eastern Europe. Since at least 2014, Russia has ruthlessly targeted Ukrainian national identity, culture, and sentiment. While it would be an overreach to equate Russian Ukrainophobia with the Nazis&apos; biological and eliminatory antisemitism, Moscow&#x2019;s irredentist war aims to destroy Ukraine as a sovereign polity and independent civil society. The Kremlin does not seek to physically annihilate all Ukrainians, as the Nazis did with the Jews. However, its agenda goes far beyond harassment, deportation, and indoctrination. It involves the expropriation, terrorization, imprisonment, torture, and murder of Ukrainians (and some Russians) who resist Russia&#x2019;s military expansion, political repression, and cultural dominance. Given this context, it is unsurprising that many Ukrainians and some Russian observers describe Russia&apos;s actions as &#x201C;fascist.&#x201D; For millions of Ukrainians living under occupation or returning to a war-torn homeland, Moscow&#x2019;s brutality is made manifest through relentless airstrikes, which frequently target civilian infrastructure &#x2014; homes, supermarkets, hospitals, and schools &#x2014; rather than military sites. Military historians might argue that targeting civilians is not unique to fascist warfare. However, for most Ukrainians, the term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; captures their reality and resonates with their collective memory of historical fascism, particularly German Nazism. For older Ukrainians who lived through World War II and younger who learned about it from their parents or grandparents, the parallels with the Luftwaffe&apos;s air raids on civilian populations, Third Reich&#x2019;s occupation policies, and Nazis&#x2019; anti-Slavic racism are stark. An increasing number of experts on Central and Eastern Europe now describe Putin&apos;s Russia as fascist. However, many comparative historians and political scientists hesitate to use this term due to their narrow definitions of generic fascism. For these scholars, a defining characteristic of fascism is the pursuit of political, social, cultural, and anthropological re- or new birth, rather than restoring a past order. Fascists often mythologize a Golden Age from their nation&#x2019;s distant past but aim to forge a new national community rather than to preserve or revive the currently decaying order. Unlike the revolutionary nature of fascism, Putinism seeks to restore the Tsarist and Soviet empires instead of creating an entirely new Russian state, culture, and identity. For this reason, many comparativists refrain from categorizing Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist. Nevertheless, Putinism has evolved significantly over the past 25 years. Putin began his political career under pro-Western democrats Anatoly Sobchak and Boris Yeltsin. Early in his presidency, Russia maintained liberal and pro-European elements, and entered the Council of Europe, NATO-Russia Council, and G8. Moscow even negotiated a deepened partnership agreement with the EU until 2014. However, Putin&#x2019;s rise to power in 1999 marked the start of Russia&#x2019;s regression from a proto-democracy to an autocracy. In 2007, during his infamous Munich Security Conference speech, Putin signaled a decisive turn away from the West. Over time, his regime became increasingly illiberal, nationalist, imperialist, and militaristic, with a partial pause during Dmitry Medvedev&#x2019;s palliative presidency. By 2022, Russia&#x2019;s pseudo-federation had shifted from semi-authoritarian to semi-totalitarian, culminating in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and alignment with authoritarian Asian states. The regime&#x2019;s regression has been marked not only by escalating rhetorical aggression, internal repression, external escalation, and political radicalization. Putin and his entourage now routinely threaten to employ nuclear weapons. Russia also implements a kind of agenda in the occupied Ukrainian territories that resembles fascist strategies. In the occupied territories, Russia&#x2019;s russification campaign employs terror, forced reeducation, and material incentives to impose a profound sociocultural transformation. While such revisionist policies are not inherently fascist, the Kremlin&#x2019;s methods and goals &#x2014; turning Ukrainian communities into ideologically standardized cells of a unified &quot;Russian people&quot; &#x2014; share similarities with the attempted fascist revolutions of Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy and Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. Russian imperial ultranationalists view Ukraine as part of &#x201C;New Russia&#x201D; or &#x201C;Little Russia,&#x201D; dismissing Ukrainians as a merely sub-ethnic group of the greater Russian people. In their narrative, Ukrainians have been misled by foreign actors &#x2014; be it the Catholic Church, Imperial Germany, the Bolsheviks, or the West &#x2014; into forming an artificial nation. This irredentist vision portrays Ukrainians as border-dwellers of the Russian empire rather than citizens of an independent state. Moscow&#x2019;s occupation policy seeks to reverse this perceived &#x201C;civilizational split&#x201D; by conducting a rebirth of &quot;Little Russia&quot; within the annexed territories. This involves a political, social, cultural, and anthropological transformation reminiscent of fascist domestic and occupation policies. While population homogenization campaigns are not exclusive to fascism, the Kremlin&#x2019;s russification efforts in Ukraine align closely enough with classical fascist strategies to be considered quasi-fascist.

(Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s current internal situation is still far from full-fledged fascism, as Putin and his circle are no domestic revolutionaries but representatives of the pre-1991 &#x201C;ancien r&#xE9;gime.&#x201D; Rather than forging a novel empire, they aim to restore the Tsarist and Soviet orders as much as possible. In this sense, Putin is less akin to Hitler and more comparable to Germany&#x2019;s last Reich president, Paul von Hindenburg, who enabled Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power by appointing him Reich chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. Within Russian pan-nationalism, Ukraine is viewed not as a foreign country but as the western frontier of Greater Russia. While most outsiders interpret Moscow&#x2019;s aggressive Ukraine policy as an implementation of Russia&#x2019;s foreign political priorities, many Russians see it as an internal affair. This perception frames the treatment of Ukraine as a family matter, where the norms of international law and humanitarian conventions are deemed irrelevant. For Ukrainian victims and international critics of Russia&#x2019;s actions, the refusal of many scholars to label Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist can seem inadequate, disingenuous, or even amoral. Russia&#x2019;s forces and occupation authorities in Ukraine &#x2014; particularly since the full-scale invasion of 2022 &#x2014; have engaged in horrendous acts of terrorism, genocide, and sadism. Insisting that these actions are unequivocally and exclusively non-fascist feels jarring in light of atrocities like the mass murders in Bucha and Mariupol, destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, mass deportation of Ukrainian children, routinized torture of the vast majority of Ukrainian prisoners of war, and targeted airstrikes on apartment buildings, universities, and libraries all over Ukraine. These crimes are neither incidental byproducts of military operations nor singular aberrations by local commanders nor standard neocolonial practices. A cautious classification of the ideology behind Russia&#x2019;s war of extermination as merely &#x201C;illiberal,&#x201D; &#x201C;conservative,&#x201D; or &#x201C;traditionalist&#x201D; seems thus grossly insufficient. Many who have studied the harrowing details of Russia&#x2019;s mass terror campaign in Ukraine would find such descriptors misleading. At the same time, reducing Putinism solely to fascism oversimplifies its nature. Explaining Moscow&#x2019;s aggression purely as an outgrowth of ultra-nationalist fanaticism ignores the political pragmatism behind many of its actions. While fascists exist within Russia&#x2019;s political and intellectual elite, most of the country&#x2019;s key policymakers are cynics rather than fanatics. A significant factor in Russia&#x2019;s pre-2022 foreign policy adventures was their perceived ease and reward. Earlier military interventions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria were not only tactically successful but also bolstered Putin&#x2019;s domestic standing. These campaigns stabilized Putin&apos;s rule in Russia&#x2019;s largely conformist society, where victories abroad translated into popular support at home. By early 2022, as Putin&#x2019;s approval ratings were waning again, a repetition of the pattern of previous foreign interventions may have seemed rational given their prior victories on the ground and enthusiastic perception at home. Russia&#x2019;s earlier military ventures had proven politically advantageous, strategically predictable, militarily effective, economically manageable, and widely popular. From this perspective, the decision to escalate in Ukraine reflects not just a murderous ideology but also calculated pragmatism.
